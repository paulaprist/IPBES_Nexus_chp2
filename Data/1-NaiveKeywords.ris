AB  - Savanna ecosystems were the landscapes for human evolution and are vital to modern Sub-Saharan African food security, yet the fundamental drivers of climate and ecology in these ecosystems remain unclear. Here we generate plant-wax isotope and dust flux records to explore the mechanistic drivers of the Northwest African monsoon, and to assess ecosystem responses to changes in monsoon rainfall and atmospheric pCO2. We show that monsoon rainfall is controlled by low-latitude insolation gradients and that while increases in precipitation are associated with expansion of grasslands into desert landscapes, changes in pCO2 predominantly drive the C3/C4 composition of savanna ecosystems. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Dry spells are serious obstacles to rainfed agriculture in Sahelian countries. Various water harvesting techniques are used by farmers to reduce the impact of climate variability, but are not sufficient in the case of a prolonged drought lasting 2–3 weeks. The farmers believe supplemental irrigation is a good way to adapt rainfed agriculture to dry spells. In this study, we evaluated the food contribution and profitability of supplemental irrigation of rainfed crops comparing various farm ponds that collect runoff water from the surrounding landscape. Methods: We analyzed the contribution of supplemental irrigation to food security and compared the profitability of different types of ponds constructed by farmers in northern Burkina Faso. Human cereal requirement was used as indicators to analyze the contribution of supplemental irrigation to food security. The criteria for analyzing the profitability of the selected ponds were gross margin (GM), net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and payback period (PBP). Results: Our results show that the additional yield of corn obtained with supplemental irrigation makes it possible to meet the monthly cereal needs of at least 17 people and generates an additional GM of FCFA 178,483 (US$ 309.26) compared to no irrigation. The estimate of the NPV, from IRR and PBP showed that the profitability of supplemental irrigation in 15 agricultural seasons varies between the type of ponds constructed. Conclusions: Given the up-front cost and the farmers’ lack of resources, the ponds require a subsidy or a credit policy to facilitate the adoption of supplemental irrigation in Sahelian countries. However, the irrigation strategies to optimize agricultural income remain a field of research to be explored. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - It is recognised today that the global food system does not always deliver good nutrition for all human beings, and, additionally, dramatically contributes to climate change, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss. In particular, the cereal sector threatens biodiversity and ecosystem functions, due to environmentally harmful farming activities, that critically alter climate conditions, along with energy, land, and water resources. According to this paper's authors' opinion, this supports the rationale of conducting a systematic literature review of Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) in the durum wheat (DW) sector, to highlight environmental hotspots and improvement potentials in the phases of cultivation and processing into finished products like pasta and bread. Methodological aspects were also discussed in this paper, to provide useful insights on how to best perform LCA in such agri-food supply chains. Given the findings from the papers reviewed, the authors could document that the cultivation phase is the primary environmental hotspot of DW-derived food products and suggested several mitigation and improvements solution including, organic farming practices, diversified cropping systems, reduction of N fertilisers and pesticides application, and irrigation optimisation strategies. Furthermore, the review highlighted that there exist two main gaps in the literature, mainly related to the scarce attention on the organic farming sector and DW landraces, and the lack of nutritional-property accounting in LCAs. Finally, although specific, the review may be of interest to researchers, LCA practitioners, farmers and producers, policy- and decision-makers, and other stakeholders, and could support the promotion of environmental sustainability in the DW sector. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The transmission dynamics and health risks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are inextricably linked to ineract with environment, climate, air pollution, and meteorological conditions. The spread of COVID-19 infection can thus perturb the ‘planetary health’ and livelihood by exerting impacts on the temporal and spatial variabilities of environmental pollution. Prioritization of COVID-19 by the health-care sector has been posing a serious threat to economic progress while undermining the efforts to meet the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for environmental sustainability. Here, we review the multifaceted effects of COVID-19 with respect to environmental quality, climatic variables, SDGs, energy resilience, and sustainability programs. It is well perceived that COVID-19 may have long-lasting and profound effects on socio-economic systems, food security, livelihoods, and the ‘nexus’ indicators. To seek for the solution of these problems, consensus can be drawn to establish and ensure a sound health-care system, a sustainable environment, and a circular bioeconomy. A holistic analysis of COVID-19's effects on multiple sectors should help develop nature-based solutions, cleaner technologies, and green economic recovery plans to help maintain environmental sustainability, ecosystem resilience, and planetary health. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Inequalities in benefits from ecosystem services (ES) challenge the achievement of sustainability goals, because they increase the vulnerability of socio-ecological systems to climate hazards. Yet the unequal effects of changes in ES, and of climate change more generally, on human well-being (HWB) are still poorly accounted for in decision-making around adaptation, particularly in tropical countries. Here, we investigate these dynamics through the lens of local peoples’ perceptions of ES in relation to human well-being (HWB), and how these are affected by climate change in three distinct regional case studies in the Atlantic Forest in Southeast of Brazil. Through structured questionnaires, we found that the local perceptions of important ES are region-dependent, particularly identifying services regulating local climate and air quality, water flow and quality, food provisioning, and cultural services of landscape esthetics related to forest regeneration. HWB was expressed through material (e.g., economic security, environmental conditions) and higher accounts of non-material (e.g., feelings, health and social connections) dimensions. Specific environmental changes were identified by 95% of those responding, 40% of whom included climate change as one of these. When asked about climate directly, 97% of those responding identified relevant changes in regionally relevant ways. Rising temperatures, unbalanced seasons, altered rainfall patterns, drought, increase of extreme events, and sea level rise are negatively affecting both material and non-material dimensions of HWB across regions. These perceived changes aligned with observed and projected climate changes in the regions. Benefits from ES accrue for HWB at different scales depending on the specific ES and region. For example, crop production by small farmers or exported in sugar cane, water captured for agricultural irrigation or used for urban supplies, and fish resources for local consumption and lifestyle or as a recreational attraction for visitors. Policy choices about such balances will affect local vulnerabilities to the expected future climate and other environmental changes in the region. This place fine-scale observations and the empowerment of local knowledge at the core of policy decisions about adaptation to support a climate-resilient future for traditional communities and small farmers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The Russian-Ukrainian war triggered a tsunami that dramatically impacted the world economy, geopolitics, and food security. Due to the extreme humanitarian situation, the effects on the environment have been overlooked. However, due to the intense fighting, the impacts will be dramatic and produce an environmental disaster. The war is already affecting areas beyond Ukraine (explosions in Russia and Moldova territory). This discussion paper aims to shed light on the potential effect of this vast conflict on the ecosystems and their services. Although the war is still ongoing, there is evidence of severe air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the intense fights. Also, warfare activities were conducted in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (the biggest in Europe) and Chernobyl, increasing the fear of radiation leaks. The biodiversity is being drastically affected due to intense deforestation and habitat destruction with potential implications for wildlife. Bombing, trench and tunnel excavations will likely negatively impact soil degradation and landscape morphology. This assumes particular importance since Ukraine has some of the most fertile soils globally (Chernozem), affecting food production. Water availability and quality are likely to be affected due to infrastructure destruction and the transport of pollutants to water reserves. The ecosystem services supplied will likely be strongly damaged since deforestation will decrease the capacity of the ecosystems to regulate air pollution or climate. Soil degradation will hamper food production, and landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage and social cohesion destruction drastically affects cultural services. Finally, the impacts on human health are already tremendous. However, it can be even higher due to exposure to high levels of contamination and sanitary conditions degradation. The war is still ongoing, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the impacts. However, we may expect a dramatic effect on the total environment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production (HANPP) of agroecosystems is critical to food security, sustainable cropland use, and key biogeochemical processes such as carbon cycling and energy flow. However, current agroecosystem management lacks the support of high-resolution crop-type-specific HANPP information. To this end, this study integrated multi-source data of crop type, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series, irrigation and climate, and multiple methods of the Miami model, the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, and process parameters to map the 30-m resolution spatial distribution of agroecosystem HANPP in the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in 2007 and 2012. We then analyzed the influences of climate condition, irrigation, and crop type on the HANPP. The average HANPP in the HRB decreased from 762.4 to 712.1 g C/m2 from 2007 to 2012, with a decrease by 6.6%. The HANPP values of wheat, barley, and oilseed rape decreased by more than 10.0%, whereas that of corn only decreased by 3.1%. The ratio of HANPP to potential NPP (NPPpot) dropped from 82.7% to 81.4% and that of land-use-induced HANPP (HANPPLUC) to HANPP from 61.9% to 58.5%, whereas that of crop-harvest-induced HANPP (HANPPharv) to HANPP increased from 38.1% to 41.5%. These changes indicated that crop productivity increased whereas NPP loss decreased. Crop type conversion accounted for 84.7% of the HANPP changes in HRB, with a value of −93.6 × 109 g C. Due to irrigation supplementation, the HANPP in high-temperature areas was higher than that in low-temperature areas with high precipitation. However, irrigation above 1000 mm no longer promoted HANPP, indicating that the irrigation efficiency in the HRB is low. Reducing HANPPLUC and carbon-water inputs while increasing HANPPharv is the key approach to obtain food security and sustainable agroecosystem development. Effective irrigation strategies and scientific crop planting adjustment should take into account their spatially heterogeneous and crop-specific impacts on the HANPP to help achieve these goals. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Drought is one of the complex and deleterious natural hazards that poses severe challenges to water security, food production, ecosystem, and socio-economic condition in India. Using efficient drought monitoring and assessment, the severe impacts of drought can be reduced. However, drought monitoring and assessment are associated with large uncertainty due to different datasets, methods, drought indices, and modeling approaches. Here, we examine the sources of uncertainty in drought assessment using multiple observational and future projections datasets, methods, and hydrological models. Moreover, we discuss potential ways to overcome the challenges associated with drought assessment in India. The drought assessment without considering uncertainty may cause overestimation or underestimation of risk in the observed and projected future climate, which further affects the planning and management of water resources. Therefore, a thorough understanding of these challenges is essential to improve the existing drought monitoring and assessment approaches. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The atmospheric microbiome is one of the least studied microbiomes of our planet. One of the most abundant, diverse and impactful parts of this microbiome is arguably fungal spores. They can be very potent outdoor aeroallergens and pathogens, causing an enormous socio-economic burden on health services and annual damages to crops costing billions of Euros. We find through hypothesis testing that an expected warmer and drier climate has a dramatic impact on the atmospheric microbiome, conceivably through alteration of the hydrological cycle impacting agricultural systems, with significant differences in leaf wetness between years (p-value <0.05). The data were measured via high-throughput sequencing analysis using the DNA barcode marker, ITS2. This was complemented by remote sensing analysis of land cover and dry matter productivity based on the Sentinel satellites, on-site detection of atmospheric and vegetation variables, GIS analysis, harvesting analysis and footprint modelling on trajectory clusters using the atmospheric transport model HYSPLIT. We find the seasonal spore composition varies between rural and urban zones reflecting both human activities (e.g. harvest), type and status of the vegetation and the prevailing climate rather than mesoscale atmospheric transport. We find that crop harvesting governs the composition of the atmospheric microbiome through a clear distinction between harvest and post-harvest beta-diversity by PERMANOVA on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (p-value <0.05). Land cover impacted significantly by two-way ANOVA (p-value <0.05), while there was minimal impact from air mass transport over the 3 years. The hypothesis suggests that the fungal spore composition will change dramatically due to climate change, an until now unforeseen effect affecting both food security, human health and the atmospheric hydrological cycle. Consequently the management of crop diseases and impact on human health through aeroallergen exposure need to consider the timing of crop treatments and land management, including post harvest, to minimize exposure of aeroallergens and pathogens. © 2022

AB  - Crops and ecosystems constantly change, and risks are derived from heavy rains, hurri-canes, droughts, human activities, climate change, etc. This has caused additional damages with economic and social impacts. Natural phenomena have caused the loss of crop areas, which endan-gers food security, destruction of the habitat of species of flora and fauna, and flooding of populations, among others. To help in the solution, it is necessary to develop strategies that maximize agricultural production as well as reduce land wear, environmental impact, and contamination of water resources. The generation of crop and land-use maps is advantageous for identifying suitable crop areas and collecting precise information about the produce. In this work, a strategy is proposed to identify and map sorghum and corn crops as well as land use and land cover. Our approach uses Sentinel-2 satellite images, spectral indices for the phenological detection of vegetation and water bodies, and automatic learning methods: support vector machine, random forest, and classification and regression trees. The study area is a tropical agricultural area with water bodies located in southeastern Mexico. The study was carried out from 2017 to 2019, and considering the climate and growing seasons of the site, two seasons were created for each year. Land use was identified as: water bodies, land in recovery, urban areas, sandy areas, and tropical rainforest. The results in overall accuracy were: 0.99% for the support vector machine, 0.95% for the random forest, and 0.92% for classification and regression trees. The kappa index was: 0.99% for the support vector machine, 0.97% for the random forest, and 0.94% for classification and regression trees. The support vector machine obtained the lowest percentage of false positives and margin of error.

AB  - Climate change is now recognized as a reality and along with human pressures such as river fragmentation by dams, amplifies the threats to freshwater ecosystems and their biodiversity. In the Brazilian portion of the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB) that encompasses the Pantanal, one of the largest tropical wetlands in the world, in addition to the high biodiversity found there, fisheries are an important ecosystem service mostly supported by migratory fishes. We estimated the current range of migratory fish of commercial interest, also assessing the climate change effects predicted on the distribution patterns. Then, we assessed the effects of future climate on fish richness, and combining species ranges with routes blocked by artificial dams investigated possible impacts on fishery and food security in the UPRB. Climate change will induce range contraction between 47% and 100% for the species analyzed, and only four migratory fish may have suitable habitat until the end-of-century. The local richness will reduce about 85% in the basin. River fragmentation by dams acting together with climate change will prevent upstream shifts for most fish species. About 4% of present range and up to 45% of future range of migratory fish should be blocked by dams in UPRB. Consequently, this will also negatively affect fishery yield and food security in the future. © 2022

AB  - Vegetables are a distinct collection of plant-based foods that vary in nutritional diversity and form an important part of the healthy diet of the human being. Besides providing basic nutrition, they have great potential for boosting human health. The balanced consumption of vegetables is highly recommended for supplementing the human body with better nutrition density, dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and bioactive compounds. However, the production and quality of fresh vegetables are influenced directly or indirectly by exposure to high temperatures or heat stress (HS). A decline in quality traits and harvestable yield are the most common effects of HS among vegetable crops. Heat-induced morphological damage, such as poor vegetative growth, leaf tip burning, and rib discoloration in leafy vegetables and sunburn, decreased fruit size, fruit/pod abortion, and unfilled fruit/pods in beans, are common, often rendering vegetable cultivation unprofitable. Further studies to trace down the possible physiological and biochemical effects associated with crop failure reveal that the key factors include membrane damage, photosynthetic inhibition, oxidative stress, and damage to reproductive tissues, which may be the key factors governing heat-induced crop failure. The reproductive stage of plants has extensively been studied for HS-induced abnormalities. Plant reproduction is more sensitive to HS than the vegetative stages, and affects various reproductive processes like pollen germination, pollen load, pollen tube growth, stigma receptivity, ovule fertility and, seed filling, resulting in poorer yields. Hence, sound and robust adaptation and mitigation strategies are needed to overcome the adverse impacts of HS at the morphological, physiological, and biochemical levels to ensure the productivity and quality of vegetable crops. Physiological traits such as the stay-green trait, canopy temperature depression, cell membrane thermostability, chlorophyll fluorescence, relative water content, increased reproductive fertility, fruit numbers, and fruit size are important for developing better yielding heat-tolerant varieties/cultivars. Moreover, various molecular approaches such as omics, molecular breeding, and transgenics, have been proved to be useful in enhancing/incorporating tolerance and can be potential tools for developing heat-tolerant varieties/cultivars. Further, these approaches will provide insights into the physiological and molecular mechanisms that govern thermotolerance and pave the way for engineering “designer” vegetable crops for better health and nutritional security. Besides these approaches, agronomic methods are also important for adaptation, escape and mitigation of HS protect and improve yields.

AB  - This article presents an analytical review of the available palaeoenvironmental and archaeological records from the southern part (ca. 42°18′–45°30′N) of Primorye spanning the last ca. 21,000 years. The outlined climate and environmental history of the coastal and continental zones of southern Primorye, based mainly on vegetation reconstructions derived from the study of fossil pollen from sedimentary deposits from various archives, is compared with the archaeological cultural sequence of the region. This shows synchronicity between several phases of climate change and cultural transition, migration and changes in population numbers and/or subsistence strategies. The pronounced warming trend during the Early Holocene (Preboreal and Boreal stages) is associated with increasing numbers of long-term camp sites of the Late Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers and a growing importance of aquatic food resources. The Holocene maximum temperature and moisture conditions during the Atlantic stage were paralleled by the emergence and flourishing of the Neolithic Rudnaya, Vetka and Boisman cultures (ca. 7.7–5.5 14C ka BP/8.5–6.2 cal ka BP). The latter was a specialised maritime forager culture distributed along the Sea of Japan coast, which likely reflects climate conditions and sea water temperatures that promoted a broad spectrum of marine food resources. Towards the end of the Atlantic stage, sea levels decreased and transformed the coastal landscape of southern Primorye, which probably contributed to the decline of the Boisman culture. At the same time, the climate started to become cooler, which is likely related to the eastward migration of Zaisanovskaya culture groups from more continental (cooler) regions to milder southern Primorye. Continuous cooling during the Subboreal was accompanied by further immigrations of Zaisanovskaya people and an increase in millet cultivation, which probably occurred in the region between ca. 4.6–4.1 14C ka BP/5.3–4.6 cal ka BP. With the emergence of the Palaeometal Epoch cultures (ca. 3.6 14C ka BP/4.0 cal ka BP), food production diversified (growing number of cultivated crops, animal husbandry) and intensified, which probably decreased the people's dependence on climatic conditions unfavourable for food procurement. However, the maximum flourishing (ca. 2.8–2.6 14C ka BP/2.9–2.6 cal ka BP) of the Palaeometal Epoch Yankovskaya culture, represented by a maximum number of documented settlement sites in Primorye's prehistoric sequence, was likely related to a coeval short phase of climate amelioration with higher air and sea water temperatures and an increased sea level, which promoted agriculture and a higher productivity of coastal waters. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Climate change is expected to have important implications for human mobility. This article discusses and contextualizes key insights from a recently published study by Thalheimer, Williams, van der Geest, and Otto in Earth's Future (2021), https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001958. The authors synthesize findings from the climate science and impact literature, among others from the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C, to explore the role of climatic drivers for human mobility in African drylands. Facing a number of economic, social, and political challenges, these areas are highly vulnerable to global warming and related risks. Climate mobility in this region is the outcome of complex interactions between individual and contextual factors shaping peoples' needs and incentives to move as well as their constraints. As the authors highlight, climate change can influence mobility outcomes through a number of channels, including impacts on food and water security, poverty and livelihood risks, and conflicts. These impacts are relevant for both rural areas and cities, with the latter representing a primary destination for climate-induced migration in Africa. The complexity and diversity of the climate mobility nexus call for integrative approaches in science and policy that bridge different disciplines and policy sectors. These approaches should be based on fair, equal, and inclusive processes of knowledge production, transfer, and implementation that involve a number of stakeholders. Inclusive deliberations and partnerships across fields and sectors are key elements to comprehensively studying and addressing the realities and manifold challenges faced by both mobile and immobile populations. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Soil can play a primary role to address key global challenges, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation; ensuring food security and human livelihood; preserving ecosystem services, biodiversity and water quality. Nevertheless, identifying and addressing key soil challenges requires a cross cutting and tailored approach that considers local context and needs. On the other hand, advancing soil science research is essential for bridging the gap between societal needs and state-of-the-art on soil knowledge. This study summarizes the outcomes of multi-stakeholder consultations carried out in Italy with the aim to identify and prioritize the key soil challenges and the main knowledge barriers/gaps that prevent to address and the main opportunities to overcome them. Soil sealing, soil erosion and the losses of soil organic matter were identified as the most relevant soil challenges in the Italian context, as their incidence is already alarming in the country. The study showed that there are many areas of soil research improvement to respond adequately to the existing soil challenges in Italy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climatic oscillation is mediated by altered temperature and precipitation patterns projected to impact food production stability and lead to food and nutritional security threats. This review discusses the potential of sorghum as a promising crop for food security in the context of climatic variation. Increasing temperatures and altering precipitation patterns change crop water requirements, lowering crop potential and production while raising the cost of water availability throughout the agricultural landscape. Under these conditions, shifting to substitute crops with minor water necessities, abiotic stress tolerance, greater yield, or biological substance per unit of water is critical for long-lasting farming. With its dual purposes implications like a staple food for humans and a major feed crop for animal feeding, sorghum can adjust to a diversity of agronomic and environmental circumstances, principally little precipitation, inadequate irrigation water availability, and salinity. Sorghum has been found to be less vulnerable to climatic variables, allowing it to maintain high productivity while also serving as a source of diet for human beings, animals, and fresh substance for industrial manufacture, as well as ensuring food security in the tropics. In-depth research is imperative for precise conclusions of the prospects of sorghum in sustainable crop modeling for food security. © 2022

AB  - Climate change is a long-lasting change in the weather arrays across tropics to polls. It is a global threat that has embarked on to put stress on various sectors. This study is aimed to conceptually engineer how climate variability is deteriorating the sustainability of diverse sectors worldwide. Specifically, the agricultural sector’s vulnerability is a globally concerning scenario, as sufficient production and food supplies are threatened due to irreversible weather fluctuations. In turn, it is challenging the global feeding patterns, particularly in countries with agriculture as an integral part of their economy and total productivity. Climate change has also put the integrity and survival of many species at stake due to shifts in optimum temperature ranges, thereby accelerating biodiversity loss by progressively changing the ecosystem structures. Climate variations increase the likelihood of particular food and waterborne and vector-borne diseases, and a recent example is a coronavirus pandemic. Climate change also accelerates the enigma of antimicrobial resistance, another threat to human health due to the increasing incidence of resistant pathogenic infections. Besides, the global tourism industry is devastated as climate change impacts unfavorable tourism spots. The methodology investigates hypothetical scenarios of climate variability and attempts to describe the quality of evidence to facilitate readers’ careful, critical engagement. Secondary data is used to identify sustainability issues such as environmental, social, and economic viability. To better understand the problem, gathered the information in this report from various media outlets, research agencies, policy papers, newspapers, and other sources. This review is a sectorial assessment of climate change mitigation and adaptation approaches worldwide in the aforementioned sectors and the associated economic costs. According to the findings, government involvement is necessary for the country’s long-term development through strict accountability of resources and regulations implemented in the past to generate cutting-edge climate policy. Therefore, mitigating the impacts of climate change must be of the utmost importance, and hence, this global threat requires global commitment to address its dreadful implications to ensure global sustenance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Advancing wet peatland ‘paludiculture’ innovation present enormous potential to sustain carbon-cycles, reduce greenhouse-gas (GHG) gas emissions and to transition communities to low-carbon economies; however, there is limited scientific-evidence to support and enable direct commercial viability of eco-friendly products and services. This timely study reports on a novel, paludiculture-based, integrated-multi-trophic-aquaculture (IMTA) system for sustainable food production in the Irish midlands. This freshwater IMTA process relies on a naturally occurring ecosystem of microalgae, bacteria and duckweed in ponds for managing waste and water quality that is powered by wind turbines; however, as it is recirculating, it does not rely upon end-of-pipe solutions and does not discharge effluent to receiving waters. This constitutes the first report on the effects of extreme weather events on the performance of this IMTA system that produces European perch (Perca fluviatilis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiis) during Spring 2020. Sampling coincided with lockdown periods of worker mobility restriction due to COVID-19 pandemic. Observations revealed that the frequency and intensity of storms generated high levels of rainfall that disrupted the algal and bacterial ecosystem in the IMTA leading to the emergence and predominance of toxic cyanobacteria that caused fish mortality. There is a pressing need for international agreement on standardized set of environmental indicators to advance paludiculture innovation that addresses climate-change and sustainability. This study describes important technical parameters for advancing freshwater aquaculture (IMTA), which can be future refined using real-time monitoring-tools at farm level to inform management decision-making based on evaluating environmental indicators and weather data. The relevance of these findings to informing global sustaining and disruptive research and innovation in paludiculture is presented, along with alignment with UN Sustainable Development goals. This study also addresses global challenges and opportunities highlighting a commensurate need for international agreement on resilient indicators encompassing linked ecological, societal, cultural, economic and cultural domains. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Achieving Good Environmental Status (GES) requires managing ecosystems subject to a variety of pressures such as climate change, eutrophication, and fishing. However, ecosystem models are generally much better at representing top-down impacts from fishing than bottom-up impacts due to warming or changes in nutrient loading. Bottom-up processes often have to be parameterised with little data or worse still taken as a system input rather than being represented explicitly. In this study we use an end-to-end ecosystem model (StrathE2E2) for the North Sea with 18 broad functional groups, five resource pools, and representations of feeding, metabolism, reproduction, active migrations, advection, and mixing. Environmental driving data include temperature, irradiance, hydrodynamics, and nutrient inputs from rivers, atmosphere, and ocean boundaries, so the model is designed to evaluate rigorously top-down and bottom-up impacts and is ideal for looking at possible changes in energy flows and “big picture” ecosystem function. In this study we considered the impacts of warming (2 and 4°C) and various levels of fishing, by demersal and pelagic fleets, on the structure and function of the foodweb. A key aim is to demonstrate whether monitoring of broad ecosystem groups could assist in deciding whether GES was being achieved. We found that warming raised primary productivity and increased the size (total biomass) of the ecosystem. Warming raised metabolic demands on omnivorous zooplankton and reduced their abundance, thus favouring benthivorous and piscivorous demersal fish at the expense of planktivorous pelagic fish but otherwise had modest effects on energy pathways and top predators, whereas changes in fishing patterns could materially alter foodweb function and the relative outcomes for top predators. We suggest that GES should be defined in terms of an unfished state and that abundances of broad groupings and the balance between them can help to assess whether indicator outcomes were consistent with GES. Our findings underwrite the need for an ecosystem approach for the management of human activities supported by relevant monitoring. We also highlight the need to improve our basic understanding of bottom-up processes, improve their representation within models, and ensure that our ecosystem models can capture growth limitation by nitrogen and other elements, and not just food/energy uptake.

AB  - The human-earth system is confronted with the challenge of providing a range of resources for a growing and more prosperous world population while simultaneously reducing environmental degradation. The sustainable development goals and the planetary boundaries define targets to manage this challenge. Many of these are linked to the land system, such as biodiversity, water, food, nutrients and climate, and are strongly interconnected. A key question is how measures can be designed in the context of multi-dimensional sustainability targets to exploit synergies. To address this, a nexus approach is adopted that acknowledges the interconnectedness between the important sub-systems water, land, food, and climate. This study quantifies synergies and trade-offs from ambitious interventions in different components of this water-land-fod-climate nexus at the global scale. For this purpose, a set of six harmonized scenarios is simulated with the model of agricultural production and its impact on the environment and Integrated model to assess the global environment models. The multi-model approach improves robustness of the results while shedding light on variations coming from different modelling approaches. Our results show that measures in the food component towards healthy diets with low meat consumption have synergies with all other nexus dimensions: Increased natural land improving terrestrial biodiversity (+4% to +8%), lower greenhouse gas emissions from land (-45% to -58%), reduced irrigation water withdrawals to protect or restore hydrological environmental flows (-3% to -24%), and reductions in nitrogen surpluses (-23% to -35%). Climate mitigation measures in line with the Paris Agreement have trade-offs with the water and food components of the nexus, as they adversely affect irrigation water withdrawals (+5% to +30% in 2050 compared to reference scenario) and food prices (+1% to +20%). The analysis of a scenario combining all measures reveals how certain measures are in conflict while others reinforce each other. This study provides an example of a nexus approach to scenario analysis providing input to the next generation of pathways aiming to achieve multiple dimensions of sustainable development. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Predicting spatial explicit information of soil nutrients is critical for sustainable soil management and food security under climate change and human disturbance in agricultural land. Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques can utilize soil-landscape information from remote sensing data to predict the spatial pattern of soil nutrients, and it is important to explore the effects of remote sensing data types on DSM. This research utilized Landsat 8 (LT), Sentinel 2 (ST), and WorldView-2 (WV) remote sensing data and employed partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to characterize the spatial pattern of soil total nitrogen (TN) in smallholder farm settings in Yellow River Basin, China. The overall relationships between TN and spectral indices from LT and ST were stronger than those from WV. Multiple red edge band-based spectral indices from ST and WV were relevant variables for TN, while there were no red band-based spectral indices from ST and WV identified as relevant variables for TN. Soil moisture and vegetation were major driving forces of soil TN spatial distribution in this area. The research also concluded that farmlands of crop rotation had relatively higher TN concentration compared with farmlands of monoculture. The soil prediction models based on WV achieved relatively lower model performance compared with those based on ST and LT. The effects of remote sensing data spectral resolution and spectral range on enhancing soil prediction model performance are higher than the effects of remote sensing data spatial resolution. Soil prediction models based on ST can provide location-specific soil maps, achieve fair model performance, and have low cost. This research suggests DSM research utilizing ST has relatively high prediction accuracy, and can produce soil maps that are fit for the spatial explicit soil management for smallholder farms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers in the agricultural production systems to keep pace with the food and nutritional demand of the galloping population had an adverse impact on ecosystem services and environmental quality. Hence, an alternative mechanism is to be developed to enhance farm production and environmental sustainability. A nanohybrid construct like nanofertilizers (NFs) is an excellent alternative to overcome the negative impact of traditional chemical fertilizers. The NFs provide smart nutrient delivery to the plants and proves their efficacy in terms of crop productivity and environmental sustainability over bulky chemical fertilizers. Plants can absorb NFs by foliage or roots depending upon the application methods and properties of the particles. NFs enhance the biotic and abiotic stresses tolerance in plants. It reduces the production cost and mitigates the environmental footprint. Multitude benefits of the NFs open new vistas towards sustainable agriculture and climate change mitigation. Although supra-optimal doses of NFs have a detrimental effect on crop growth, soil health, and environmental outcomes. The extensive release of NFs into the environment and food chain may pose a risk to human health, hence, need careful assessment. Thus, a thorough review on the role of different NFs and their impact on crop growth, productivity, soil, and environmental quality is required, which would be helpful for the research of sustainable agriculture. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The coast of Peru lies within the tropics under the influence of the cold, nutrient-rich waters of the Humboldt Current and the interannual onslaught of the El Niño phenomenon. The Peruvian upwelling system is exceptionally productive and is comprised of subsystems at different scales along the coast. We aimed to understand the differences between two shallow coastal systems along a latitudinal gradient: Sechura Bay in the north (at the convergence of Humboldt and tropical waters) and Independencia Bay in the central-south (under typical upwelling conditions). We compared their biodiversity, trophic dynamics, community energetics, resource use and underlying abiotic conditions. Our analysis revealed that over the past two decades, Sechura has shown a warming trend, while Independencia has maintained its cold water conditions. Chlorophyll concentrations have risen significantly in both systems, higher values in Sechura suggesting there is an increase in local pressures that could lead to eutrophication. Trophic models of the La Niña 07/08 period revealed that both systems are bottom-up driven with high biomass and production at the lower trophic levels, though top-down controls were also shown, particularly in Sechura. While primary productivity was similar in both systems, differences were found in the structure and size of energy flows. More cycling and higher transfer efficiency were found in Independencia, where phytoplankton-based food chains played the main role in the overall dynamic. In contrast, the detritus food chain appears to be more relevant for energy flow in Sechura. Differences in biota and flow structure relate to the systems’ environmental conditions, i.e., more diverse warm-water species in the north and mostly cold water adapted species (mainly invertebrate filter-feeders and their predators) in the central-south. Catches in both systems were dominated by the diving fisheries and comprised mostly scallops (bottom-cultured), snails and fish in Sechura, and mussels, clams, crabs and fish in Independencia. Overall, system indicators suggest that Sechura is a comparatively less developed system. Independencia shall likely maintain its general highly productive system features, whereas Sechura will continue to be more frequently disturbed by El Niño and ongoing human-driven activities, reducing its overall stability and functionality. In the context of climate change, acknowledging these differences is essential for future adaptive management regimes. Copyright © 2022 Del Solar, Romagnoni, Kluger, Céspedes and Wolff.

AB  - The global population increase puts tremendous pressure on the already dwindling natural resources such as soil and freshwater. Healthy and productive soils as well as the availability of freshwater resources are critical for agricultural productivity. On the other hand, climate change and variability make the water scarcity problem even worse. Agriculture, being the biggest consumer of fresh water, is expected to be affected significantly. Yet, agriculture is expected to play a significant role in achieving greater food, and fiber needs to meet the growing global population. In addition, soil and water quality are also becoming a bigger threat to soil productivity and freshwater availability. Some portion of nutrients applied to agriculture and urban landscapes end up in runoff and leaching water that feeds streams, rivers, lakes, groundwater, etc. These excess nutrient loadings are causing soil and water quality deterioration, which could have severe impacts on human health, aquatic ecosystems, and environmental sustainability. In addition to nutrient and chemical pollutions, emerging contaminants such as heavy metals are showing an increasing trend in soil and freshwater bodies. These emerging contaminants not only impair soil quality and freshwater sources but could also get into the food chain and affect human and animal health. While growing evidence is becoming available on the increasing threats from emerging contaminants, research and understanding are still limited. This mini-review paper summarizes available research on types of emerging contaminants and their impacts on soil and water quality. Copyright © 2022 Bayabil, Teshome and Li.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a major role in maintaining ecosystem functions. AM fungi are found in most ecosystems including rangelands currently under increasing pressures from human activities. Southern Patagonia (Argentina) is a semiarid region influenced by extensive livestock production in rangelands. There is a lack of information about the environmental conditions and functionality of AM fungi in plant species of Patagonia ecosystems associated with livestock grazing. We assessed how soil properties, climatic conditions, and grazing intensities influence the response of AM fungi colonization. We studied most palatable and representative plant species (Poa dusenii, Rytidosperma virescens, Festuca gracillima, Nardophylum bryoides, Mulguraea tridens, and Carex argentina) growing in main ecological areas of Southern Patagonia. Most of the studied plant species (except C. argentina) presented AM symbiosis. AM colonization showed a negative relationship with soil organic carbon and nitrogen and a positive relationship with soil bulk density and pH. Results suggest that plants promoted a higher root AM colonization when soil nutrients and water availability (rainfall) are limiting. Sheep stocking rates had a differential impact depending on the ecological areas and plant life forms. High grazing decreased the AM colonization in the ecological areas with palatable plant dominance, suggesting that the impacts of grazing could lead to further negative effects on the ecosystem. Moderate grazing allows to maintain higher AM colonization, which would probably benefit the aboveground production of palatable plant and, consequently, to herbivores, particularly in degraded rangelands like Patagonian steppes. This study improves the knowledge of AM association in Patagonian semiarid rangelands by increasing our understanding of the impacts of grazing on belowground ecology. This information becomes relevant for grazing sustainable management, which may contribute to food security. © 2021 The Society for Range Management

AB  - Over the last 150 years, there has been a dramatic increase in research focusing on droughts in every part of the world, due to their negative impacts on multiple sectors, the functioning of ecosystems and human wellbeing. However, our understanding of the long-term trends of drought-related research remains limited. Therefore, this study is aimed at providing a generalised quantitative and qualitative synthesis of drought-related research publications from 1861 to 2019 in the Scopus database, using bibliometric and science mapping analytics. Title-speciﬁc field drought-related articles were mined and analysed for explanatory characteristics to identify different research trends, global and national interests and their contributions’. The results of the synthesis revealed a total of 26,221 articles from 45,329 authors and 3181 journals. The annual research production in drought-related research thus exhibited a 7.87% annual growth rate during this period from 1861 to 2019. Drought as a central theme witnessed a mean growth rate (MGR) of 8170% in the last 3 years (2017–2019). The prevailing topics include drought tolerance, resilience, climate change, and drought resistance, which had MGRs of 1100%, 530%, 2030% and 70% in 2017–2019, respectively. With an MGR of 1030%, remote sensing appeared to be a widespread method used in the monitoring of meteorological drought (600%), agricultural drought (730%), and hydrological drought (330%). Four trending thematic areas identified in drought-related research from 1861 to 2019 were climate change-related; physiology and biochemistry in plant/herb photosynthesis; molecular genetics and mechanisms of drought impacts (stress), tolerance and resistance in crops/plants; and emerging concept related to the circadian rhythms of biological systems in drought conditions. It also emerged from an analysis of the thematic areas that drought-related research in South Africa focused on agriculture and food-security, water-security, environmental sustainability, socioeconomics (among others) during the relevant period. © 2021

AB  - Aflatoxin contamination remains one of the most important threats to food safety and human health. Aflatoxins are mainly found in soil, decaying plant material and food storage systems and are particularly abundant during drought stress. Regulations suggest the disposal of aflatoxin-contaminated crops by incorporation into the soil for natural degradation. However, the fate and consequences of aflatoxin in soil and on soil organisms providing essential ecological services remain unclear and could potentially pose a risk to soil health and productivity. The protection of soil biodiversity and ecosystem services are essential for the success of the declared United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. The focus of this study was to investigate the toxicological consequences of aflatoxins to earthworms’ survival, growth, reproduction and genotoxicity under different temperature and moisture conditions. Results indicated an insignificant effect of aflatoxin concentrations between 10 and 100 µg/kg on the survival, growth and reproduction but indicated a concentration-dependent increase in DNA damage at standard testing conditions. However, the interaction of the toxin with different environmental conditions, particularly low moisture, resulted in significantly reduced reproduction rates and increased DNA damage in earthworms. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - East African marine waters, particularly those impacted by the East African Coastal Current, have a reputation for data sparsity that presents significant challenges to efforts to develop, implement, and operate effective management and governance structures to sustainably manage fisheries and the marine environment. As many coastal communities are dependent upon the ocean for livelihoods and sustenance marine resources are a central component of regional food security. However, the growing challenge of increased food insecurity in response to growing human populations, increased pressures on marine resources and the impacts of climate change is significant and improved knowledge about the marine environment is urgently required to better support decision making efforts to address this challenge. In this introductory paper we present the key findings from a series of observational, numerical and socioeconomic studies addressing issues facing marine food security in the coastal regions of Tanzania and Kenya. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Water scarcity is a global challenge, yet existing responses are failing to cope with current shocks and stressors, including those attributable to climate change. In sub-Saharan Africa, the impacts of water scarcity threaten livelihoods and wellbeing across the continent and are driving a broad range of adaptive responses. This paper describes trends of water scarcity for Africa and outlines climate impacts on key water-related sectors on food systems, cities, livelihoods and wellbeing, conflict and security, economies, and ecosystems. It then uses systematic review methods, including the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative, to analyse 240 articles and identify adaptation characteristics of planned and autonomous responses to water scarcity across Africa. The most common impact drivers responded to are drought and participation variability. The most frequently identified actors responding to water scarcity include individuals or households (32%), local government (15%) and national government (15%), while the most common types of response are behavioural and cultural (30%), technological and infrastructural (27%), ecosystem-based (25%) and institutional (18%). Most planned responses target low-income communities (31%), women (20%), and indigenous communities (13%), but very few studies target migrants, ethnic minorities or those living with disabilities. There is a lack of coordination of planned adaptation at scale across all relevant sectors and regions, and lack of legal and institutional frameworks for their operation. Most responses to water scarcity are coping and autonomous responses that showed only minor adjustments to business-as-usual water practices, suggesting limited adaptation depth. Maladaptation is associated with one or more dimension of responses in almost 20% of articles. Coordinating institutional responses, carefully planned technologies, planning for projected climate risks including extension of climate services and increased climate change literacy, and integrating indigenous knowledge will help to address identified challenges of water scarcity towards more adaptive responses across Africa. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Transboundary river basins across developing countries, such as the Lower Mekong River Basin (LMB), are challenging to manage given frequent divergences on development and conservation priorities. Driven by needs to sustain economic performance and reduce poverty, the LMB countries are embarking on significant land use changes in the form of more hydropower dams, to satisfy growing energy demands. This pathway could lead to irreversible changes to the ecosystem of the Mekong River, if not properly managed. Given the uncertain environmental externalities and trade-offs associated with further hydropower development and operation in the LMB, this research develops four plausible scenarios of future hydropower operation, and assesses their likely impact on streamflow and instream total suspended solids and nitrate loads of the Mekong River. The findings suggest that further hydropower operations on either tributary or mainstream could result in annual and wet season flow reduction between 11 and 25% while increase dry season flows by 1 to 15%, when compared to a business-as-usual scenario. Conversely, hydropower operation on both tributary and mainstream could result in dry season flow reduction between 10 and 15%. Both instream TSS and nitrate loads are forecasted to reduce under all three scenarios by as much as 78 and 20%, respectively, compared to the business-as-usual one. These effects are predicted to magnify under extreme climate conditions with dry season flow, TSS, and nitrate levels reduced by as much as 44, 81 and 35%, respectively, during a projected extreme dry climate condition, but less severe under improved operational alternatives. With further hydropower development in the LMB being highly unavoidable, these findings can inform effective transboundary management pathways for balancing electricity generation and protection of riverine ecology, water and food security, and people livelihoods. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This review paper aimed to summarize the climate change impacts on water sources and their relation with human and ecosystem health and evaluate better management strategies. In aquatic environments, climate change causes alteration of biodiversity and species distribution, changes in the duration of biological functions, decreasing productivities, alteration in food web structures, as well as triggering the invasion of various species, and variation in the presence, abundance, and concentrations of various co-stressors. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the surface water temperature in the oceans has risen by about 1°C. Consequently, human well-being is directly and indirectly affected by these alterations. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 3.5 million people die from water-related diseases each year. It is projected that the number of water-related diseases will increase due to the effects of climate change. To cope with these problems, alternative water management strategies should be developed to have resilient water systems in terms of both ecological and technological perspectives. Thus, water management requires the cooperation of many sectors including citizens, institutions, public and private sectors, etc. within a multi-stakeholder approach. © 2022 Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Forestales.

AB  - Globally, extreme temperatures have severe impacts on the economy, human health, food and water security, and ecosystems. Mortality rates have been increased due to heatwaves in several regions. Specifically, megacities have high impacts with the increasing temperature and ever-expanding urban areas; it is important to understand extreme temperature changes in terms of duration, magnitude, and frequency for future risk management and disaster mitigation. Here we framed a novel Semi-Parametric quantile mapping method to bias-correct the CMIP6 minimum and maximum temperature projections for 199 megacities worldwide. The changes in maximum and minimum temperature are quantified in terms of climate indices (ETCCDI and HDWI) for the four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). Cities in northern Asia and northern North America (Kazan, Samara, Heihe, Montréal, Edmonton, and Moscow) are warming at a higher rate compared to the other regions. There is an increasing and decreasing trend for the warm and cold extremes respectively. Heatwaves increase exponentially in the future with the increase in warming, that is, from SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5. Among the CMIP6 models, a huge variability is observed, and this further increases as the warming increases. All climate indices have steep slopes for the far future (2066–2100) compared to the near future (2031–2065). Yet the variability among CMIP6 models in near future is high compared to the far future for cold indices. © 2022

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to analyze a decolonized peace with gender perspective. Liberal democracies had consolidated on conquest, slavery, racism, sexism, colonialism, raw material extraction and female exploitation. Additional burdens came from neoliberal globalization with the massive burning of fossil oil, changing the Earth's history from the Holocene toward the Anthropocene. Multiple nexus between the human and environmental system requires an epistemology from the Global South. The paper explores alternative peace paradigms enabling poor and exploited people to overcome the destructive outcomes of patriarchal violence and extractivism. Regionally and locally, they are experimenting with just, safe, equal and sustainable alternatives of free societies. Design/methodology/approach: The nexus approach focuses on system efficiency, internal and external feedbacks and allows decision-making processes with stronger cross-sectoral coordination and multi-level governance. It includes the understanding of the policy agenda and the political actors at different levels, explaining the discrimination of gender from local to global. The analysis establishes complex relations between theory and political actions, due that all actions are inherently mediated by gender. A key focus is a relationship and the outcomes of policies, where communication and collaboration at the local level grant efficient peaceful resource management with gender equity. Findings: An engendered-sustainable peace approach is culturally decentralized and may offer alternatives to the ongoing destruction process of neoliberal corporatism and violence. Drastic systemic change requires massive changes from bottom-up and top-down before 2030–2050. Global solidarity among all excluded people, especially women and girls, promotes from childhood an engendered-sustainable peace-building process, where positive feedbacks may reduce the tipping points on Earth and among humankind. Engendered-sustainable peace can mitigate the upcoming conflicts and catastrophes, limiting the negative feedbacks from abusive, selfish and destructive corporations. A greater self-regulating sustainable system with a HUGE-security could promote a decolonized, engendered and sustainable peace for everybody. Research limitations/implications: The interconnected risks are cascading across different domains, where systemic challenges have intensified conflicts and violence, due to uncertainty, instability and fragility. Cascading effects not only demand prevention for sudden disruptions (hurricanes, floods) but also for slow-ongoing processes (drought, sea-level rise, lack of water availability, etc.), which are equally or more disruptive. Women suffer differently from disasters and are prone to greater impacts on their life and livelihood. An engendered peace is limited by the deep engrained patriarchal system. Only a culture of peace with gender recognition may grant future peace and also the sustainable care of ecosystems. Practical implications: The Global South is exploring alternative ways to overcome the present violent and destructive globalization by promoting deep engrained indigenous values of Aymaras’ living well, the shell model of commanding by obeying of the Zapatistas or Bhutan’s Happiness Index. Globally, critical women and men are promoting subsistence agriculture, solidarity or gift economy, where local efforts are restoring the equilibrium between humans and nature. An engendered-sustainable peace is limiting the destructive impacts of the Anthropocene, climate change and ongoing pandemics. Social implications: An engendered-sustainable peace is culturally decentralized and offers alternatives to the ongoing destruction process of neoliberal corporatism, climate change and violence. The text explores how to overcome the present hybrid warfare with alternative HUGE security and peace from the bottom-up. Regional reinforcement of food security, safe water management, local jobs and a concordian economy for the most vulnerable may change the present exploitation of nature and humankind. Growing solidarity with people affected by disasters is empowering women and girls and dismantling from the bottom-up, the dominant structures of violence and exploitation. Originality/value: The military-industrial-scientific corporate complex and the exploitation of women, men and natural resources, based on patriarchy, has produced climate change, poverty and global pandemics with millions of unnecessary deaths and suffering. A doughnut engendered peace looking from the outside and inside of the system of globalization and environmental destruction proposes to overcome the growth addiction by a growth agnostic society. Engendered peace explores alternative and sustainable values that go beyond the dominant technological changes. It includes a culturally, politically and institutionally ingrained model where everybody is a participant, reinforcing an engendered-sustainable peace and security for everybody. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Traditional coffee cultivation in Cuba is the result of a complex interaction between different flora species creating agroforestry systems widely spread in mountainous area. The systems, product of local traditional knowledge, are mainly devoted to coffee production but, thanks to the interaction with other species, farmers provide different food products both for self-consumption and to be sold. Furthermore, the adoption of shade trees in order to reach a better quality of the coffee cultivated creates particular microclimate conditions favorable for microorganisms, fauna species and also for spontaneous flora species. According to this it is clear the relationships between traditional knowledge and biodiversity preservation which is fundamental also for improving the surrounding environment, avoiding floods or hydrogeological instability damages, concurring to climate change mitigation and carbon storage. Traditional agroforestry systems are one of the best example of coexistence and coevolution between man and nature, being an historical system adopted by local communities to satisfy their needs in total respect of the surrounding environment. Considering this, the promotion and maintenance of this kind of systems and knowledge related might constitute a valid example to actively preserve biodiversity while respecting human needs for food and livelihood security. These systems are also of particular importance considering the importance of coffee as a beverage served in many countries of the world, but often produced in intensive plantations. This paper shows the high sustainability of coffee production under the shade of trees and support a new concept of food quality contributing to preserve local cultures and environments. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Agricultural land is a very important ecosystem that provides a range of services like food, maintenance of soil structure, and hydrological services with high ecological value to human wellbeing Ecosystem Services (ESs). Understanding the contribution of different agricultural practices to supply ESs would help inform choices about the most beneficial land use management. Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are defined by IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) as actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges (e.g., climate change, food and water security, or natural disasters) effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human wellbeing and biodiversity benefits. Some actions farmers can implement in the new Rural Development Programs (RDP 2021–2022 and 2023–2027) can be considered as NbS and could affect the quantity, quality, and time of some ESs related to water regulation and supply, N adsorption and erosion protection. This study aims to evaluate these ESs in different scenarios in the upper Foglia river basin (Italy) and at a local scale (farming), and to highlight the issue to compensate farmers for the production of public goods which benefit the whole society (ESs) by the implementation of RDP’s actions. These scenarios highlight how actions have positive effects on ecosystem services and their economic value related to land use management, on maintaining agricultural practices by integrating Water Frame Directive (2000/60/EC), Directive 2007/60/EC on the management of flood risks and highlighting the potential role of farmers in a high diversity landscape. This study highlights a new way to evaluate the processes of natural capital in the production of public goods, which benefits the whole society (ESs), by emphasizing the economic and environmental role of farmers in producing them and putting on the table data to trigger a PES (Payment for Ecosystem Services) mechanism. To facilitate decision making, robust decision support tools are needed, underpinned by comprehensive cost-benefit analyses and spatially modeling in which agriculture can be a strategic sector to optimize food production and environmental protection in harmony with the Farm to Fork (F2F) strategy. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is the primary determinant of soil functionality. Soil organic carbon (SOC) accounts for 50% of the SOM content, accompanied by nitrogen, phosphorus, and a range of macro and micro elements. As a dynamic component, SOM is a source of numerous ecosystem services critical to human well-being and nature conservancy. Important among these goods and services generated by SOM include moderation of climate as a source or sink of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases, storage and purification of water, a source of energy and habitat for biota (macro, meso, and micro-organisms), a medium for plant growth, cycling of elements (N, P, S, etc.), and generation of net primary productivity (NPP). The quality and quantity of NPP has direct impacts on the food and nutritional security of the growing and increasingly affluent human population. Soils of agroecosystems are depleted of their SOC reserves in comparison with those of natural ecosystems. The magnitude of depletion depends on land use and the type and severity of degradation. Soils prone to accelerated erosion can be strongly depleted of their SOC reserves, especially those in the surface layer. Therefore, conservation through restorative land use and adoption of recommended management practices to create a positive soil-ecosystem carbon budget can increase carbon stock and soil health. This volume of Advances in Soil Sciences aims to accomplish the following: • Present impacts of land use and soil management on SOC dynamics. • Discuss effects of SOC levels on agronomic productivity and use efficiency of inputs. • Detail potential of soil management on the rate and cumulative amount of carbon sequestration in relation to land use and soil/crop management. • Deliberate the cause-effect relationship between SOC content and provisioning of some ecosystem services. • Relate soil organic carbon stock to soil properties and processes. • Establish the relationship between soil organic carbon stock with land and climate. • Identify controls of making soil organic carbon stock as a source or sink of CO2. • Connect soil organic carbon and carbon sequestration for climate mitigation and adaptation. © 2022 Rattan Lal.

AB  - Hyperarid, arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid areas cover approximately 41% of the global land area. The human population in drylands, currently estimated at 2.7 billion, faces limited access to sufficient, affordable, and nutritious food. We discuss the interlinkages among water security, environmental security, energy security, economic security, health security, and food security governance, and how they affect food security in drylands. Reliable and adequate water supply, and the prevention of water contamination, increase the potential for ample food, fodder, and fiber production. Protecting woodlands and rangelands increases food security by buffering the slow onset effects of climate change, including biodiversity loss, desertification, salinization, and land degradation. The protection of natural lands is expected to decrease environmental contamination, and simultaneously, reduce the transfer of diseases from wildlife to humans. Biofuel production and hydroelectric power plants increase energy security but generate land-use conflicts, deforestation, and ecosystem degradation. Economic security generally positively correlates with food security. However, economic growth often degrades the environment, changes tenure rights over natural resources, and stimulates migration to urban areas, resulting in lower food and health security. Moreover, civil unrest, political instability, and armed conflicts disrupt local economies in drylands. Maintaining food security is crucial for health security; conversely, malnourished populations and unresponsive health systems decrease economic security, and adversely affect environmental, energy, and food security. Climate change is expected to deteriorate health security by spreading vector-borne diseases. Effective governance and timely interventions can substantially shorten periods of food insecurity, lower their intensities, and accelerate recovery from inevitable crises, and are therefore crucial in preventing humanitarian crises. Since global drylands population will nearly double by 2050, and since drylands are among the most susceptible areas to climate change, integrated multi-hazard approaches to food security are needed. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Food systems are increasingly being understood as driving various health and ecological crises and their transformation is recognised as a key opportunity for planetary health. First-food systems represent an underexplored aspect of this transformation. Despite breastfeeding representing the optimal source of infant nutrition, use of commercial milk formula (CMF) is high and growing rapidly. In this review, we examine the impact of CMF use on planetary health, considering in particular its effects on climate change, water use and pollution and the consequences of these effects for human health. Milk is the main ingredient in the production of CMF, making the role of the dairy sector a key area of attention. We find that CMF use has twice the carbon footprint of breastfeeding, while 1 kg of CMF has a blue water footprint of 699 L; CMF has a significant and harmful environmental impact. Facilitation and protection of breastfeeding represents a key part of developing sustainable first-food systems and has huge potential benefits for maternal and child health. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In a warming climate, rising seawater temperatures and declining primary and secondary production will drastically affect growth and fitness of marine invertebrates in the northern Atlantic Ocean. To study the ecological performance of juvenile hydroids Hydractinia echinata we exposed them to current and predicted water temperatures which reflect the conditions in the inter- and subtidal in combination with changing food availability (high and low) in laboratory experiments. Here we show, that the interplay between temperature stress and diminished nutrition affected growth and vitality of juvenile hydroids more than either factor alone, while high food availability mitigated their stress responses. Our numerical growth model indicated that the growth of juvenile hydroids at temperatures beyond their optimum is a saturation function of energy availability. We demonstrated that the combined effects of environmental stressors should be taken into consideration when evaluating consequences of climate change. Interactive effects of ocean warming, decreasing resource availability and increasing organismal energy demand may have major impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: To guide the transformation of food systems to provide for healthy and sustainable diets, countries need to assess their current diet and food supply in comparison to nutrition, health, affordability, and environmental goals. OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare Indonesia's food utilization to diets optimized for nutritional value and cost and to diets that are increasingly plant-based in order to meet further health and environmental goals, including the EAT-Lancet planetary health diet, to explore whether multiple goals could be achieved simultaneously. METHODS: We compared 13 dietary scenarios (2 current, 7 optimized, 3 increasingly plant-based, 1 EAT-Lancet) for nutrient content, cost, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe), and water footprints, using the FAO food balance sheet, Indonesia Household Income and Expenditure Survey household food expenditure, food composition, life cycle assessment, food losses, and trade data. RESULTS: The diversity of modeled scenarios was higher than that of current consumption, reflecting nutritional deficiencies underlying Indonesia's burden of different forms of malnutrition. Nutrient intake targets were met best by nutrient- and cost-optimized diets, followed by the EAT-Lancet diet. Those diets also had high GHGe, although less than 40% of a scenario in which Indonesia would adopt a typical high-income country's diet. Only the low food chain diet had a GHGe below the 2050 target set by the EAT-Lancet commission. Its nutrient content was comparable to that of a no-dairy diet, slightly above those of fish-and-poultry and current diets, and somewhat below those of the EAT-Lancet diets. To meet nutrient needs, some animal-source foods had to be included. Costs of all except the optimized diets were above the current national average food expenditure. No scenario met all goals simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Indonesia's consumption of rice and unhealthy foods should decrease; food production, trade, and processing should prioritize diversification, (bio)fortification, and limiting environmental impacts; and consumer and institutional demands for healthy, nutritious, and sustainable foods should be stimulated. More granular data and tools are required to develop and assess more detailed scenarios to achieve multiple goals simultaneously. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Humans in their increasing numbers and wealth are changing ecosystems through accelerated consumption of food, natural resources and energy which continue to cause significant damage to the planet. Using ‘stunting in children’ as a case study, we show how the traditional siloed (specialist) approaches have failed to reduce stunting world-wide. Despite significant effort, traditional approaches fail to appreciate the interconnectedness of the multiple factors that underpin stunting. We will not improve the lives of the millions of children living in poverty by doing the same things we have always done, rather we need to adopt approaches that recognise the interconnectedness of all the component parts and apply One Health methods designed to solve these intractable problems. © 2021 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians).

AB  - Current farm systems rely on the use of Plant Protection Products (PPP) to secure high productivity and control threats to the quality of the crops. However, PPP use may have considerable impacts on human health and the environment. A study protocol is presented aiming to determine the occurrence and levels of PPP residues in plants (crops), animals (livestock), humans and other non-target species (ecosystem representatives) for exposure modelling and impact assessment. To achieve this, we designed a cross-sectional study to compare conventional and organic farm systems across Europe. Environmental and biological samples were/are being/will be collected during the 2021 growing season, at 10 case study sites in Europe covering a range of climate zones and crops. An additional study site in Argentina will inform the impact of PPP use on growing soybean which is an important European protein-source in animal feed. We will study the impact of PPP mixtures using an integrated risk assessment methodology. The fate of PPP in environmental media (soil, water and air) and in the homes of farmers will be monitored. This will be complemented by biomonitoring to estimate PPP uptake by humans and farm animals (cow, goat, sheep and chicken), and by collection of samples from non-target species (earthworms, fish, aquatic and terrestrial macroinvertebrates, bats, and farm cats). We will use data on PPP residues in environmental and biological matrices to estimate exposures by modelling. These exposure estimates together with health and toxicity data will be used to predict the impact of PPP use on environment, plant, animal and human health. The outcome of this study will then be integrated with socio-economic information leading to an overall assessment used to identify transition pathways towards more sustainable plant protection and inform decision makers, practitioners and other stakeholders regarding farming practices and land use policy. © 2021 Silva et al.

AB  - Excessive use of synthetic chemicals in conventional agriculture largely degraded the agroecosystems that constitute approximately 40% of the global terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, changing climate resulted in a substantial loss in agricultural productivity (both in quantity and in quality) mainly due to diverse abiotic and biotic stresses. This draws public awareness about depleting natural resources, viz., soil, land, and water due to unsustainable agricultural practices and equivalently concerns for food-related animal and human health risks. Modern organic agriculture has shown positive impacts in terms of food/biomass production, climate resilience, soil health, biodiversity, nutritional security, and good quality of life; and is of prodigious demand for nutrient-rich organic food products. In the ensuing decade, owing to the principal focus for the quality aspects or health benefits of organic agriculture, this review explores how organic interventions affect the nutritional value and yield quality in a production system; enable plants to adapt to adverse futuristic environmental conditions, and address the global food and nutritional security challenges. The chronological emergence, current global status, public perceptions, and key components of organic agriculture with their attached health benefits are inextricably synthesized herein. Fostering the ethos of organic agriculture under the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030) is highly imperative for agroecosystem restoration and its sustainable management. Moreover, the multidimensional paybacks of organic agriculture help in attaining important global goals and targets such as the Bonn Challenge and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) by the year 2030. Therefore, invigorating the escalation of organic farming as a concurrent strategy of soil, land, and ecosystem restoration is the need of the hour. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The “2030 Sustainable Development Goals” outline the need for education for sustainable development to sustain planetary health. Thus, higher education institutions that train health professionals should consider embedding competencies to promote planetary health. Competencies for achieving planetary health include displacement due to climate change, vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly or the poorest, water and food security, the burden of infectious diseases, catastrophes such as floods or extreme temperatures, air pollutants, or mental health effects. Therefore, education for sustainable development aims to provide students with the knowledge, skills and attitudes to be effective in addressing global health challenges, such as the interdependence of ecosystems and human health, including the effects of environmental change on health, as well as the impact of the health sector and its dependence on the environment. Some European universities have already started to make the training of health professionals more sustainable and are examples of the steps that need to be taken. © 2021

AB  - Water demand is expected to continue rising to support growing population, particularly in water-stressed countries and regions. Amid competitive water needs for agricultural, domestic, and industrial sectors, water allocations for environmental requirements are critical to ensure the sustainability of the ecosystems. This study takes stock of water availability trends per capita across countries and proposes a water scarcity indicator to quantify the amount of water available for agricultural, domestic, and industrial activities after the needs of freshwater ecosystems (environmental flow requirements, EFR) are ideally fulfilled. The study reveals that by 2050, 87 out of 180 countries will have annual renewable water resources (ARWR) per capita below 1700 m3/year. The number of countries with absolute water scarcity – ARWR per capita below 500 m3/year is projected to increase from 25 in 2015 to 45 by 2050. Population growth is projected to cause a sharp decline in water availability in many low-income and lower-middle-income countries, while economic development will push water use upwards, making the water supply gap more complicated and challenging to address. After the Middle East and North Africa region, Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to become the next hotspot of water scarcity along with several countries from Asia. In response, water-scarce countries need to promote water conservation, water recycling, and reuse; ensure sustainable water resources augmentation via harnessing the potential of unconventional water resources; support productivity enhancement of underperforming land and water resources; and address challenges beyond technical solutions. Pertinent political agenda and associated public policies, supportive institutions, institutional collaborations, and skilled professionals would be the key to ensure sufficient water supply for human use and ecosystems. © 2021

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a very important environmental factor that impacts the energy and water exchange between the atmosphere and ecosystems. Research on China's climate change in the context of global climate change is of great significance for global and Chinese food security as well as the sustained and stable development of the social economy. Compared with surface temperature data obtained via thermal infrared remote sensing, information regarding the maximum surface temperature is of increased significance as it removes the influence of clouds and rain. The annual variation of the maximum surface temperature is relatively stable; however, it is highly sensitive to changes in land use, drought, and heat waves. This study uses moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface temperature data and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to obtain the annual maximum surface temperature using the maximum value synthesis method. On the basis of the MODIS LST data from 2003 to 2018, the temporal and spatial distribution and variation characteristics of annual LST maxima in China were analyzed using techniques including the climate trend rate and linear correlation coefficient, and regional analyses were conducted according to the agricultural climate regionalization of China. The correlation between the annual maximum change of the LST and land cover types in China is established. The correlation between the annual maximum LST and the maximum NDVI in the regions with significant trend changes is studied, and the factors that influence the annual maximum LST change in China are investigated. The results obtained indicate the following: (1) The annual maximum value of China's surface temperature presents a higher spatial distribution characteristic in the north and lower in the south; its highest value was observed in the Turpan Basin of Xinjiang. (2) According to the analysis of the spatial distribution of the annual maximum surface temperature in China's climate zoning, the annual maximum surface temperature is the highest in the temperate continental climate zone, with an average of 325.39 K over 16 years. The second hottest region is the temperate monsoon climate zone, where the average annual maximum surface temperature over 16 years is 312.84 K. The plateau mountain, subtropical monsoon, and tropical monsoon climate zones have lower values of annual maximum surface temperature. The spatial distribution pattern of the annual maximum surface temperature is related to the type of surface cover. (3) During the period of 2003-2018, the temporal variation of the annual maximum surface temperature in China showed a slight cooling trend, with a climate tendency rate of -0.06 K·(10a)- 1; the area in which a cooling trend was observed accounted for 50.45% of the country's total area. (4) The climate tendency rate of the annual maximum surface temperature and the linear correlation coefficient are high in the west and low in the east, and the warming trend in the west is clearer than that in the east. Some areas showed a significant cooling trend; these areas included central northern China, southern China, and the edge of the Tarim Basin. The cooling in these areas is related to changes in the vegetation cover. The maximum surface temperature contains a large amount of geographic information, which reflects the impact of human activities on the geographic environment and provides theoretical support for decisions related to transforming the geographic environment. © 2021 Arid Land Geography.

AB  - Adequate water resources management includes understanding patterns and spatiotempo-ral variability of precipitation, as this variable is determinant for ecosystems’ stability, food security, and most human activities. Based on satellite estimations validated through ground measurements from 59 meteorological stations, the objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term spatiotemporal variability and trends of the average monthly precipitation in the Magdalena Department, Colombia, for the 1981–2018 period. This heterogeneous region comprises many different ecoregions in its 23,188 km2 area. The analysis of spatial variability allowed for the determination of four different subregions based on the differences in the average values of precipitation and the degree of rainfall variability. The trend analysis indicates that the current rainfall patterns contradict previous estimates of a progressive decrease in annual averages due to climate change in the study region, as most of the department does not exhibit statistically significant trends, except for the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta area, where this study found reductions between 10 mm yr−1 and 30 mm yr−1. The findings of this study also suggest the existence of some links between precipitation patterns with regional phenomena of climate variability and solar activity. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Grazing cattle production plays a fundamental role in rural landscape conservation, food security, and bioeconomy, allowing for subsistence, income, insurance, and food around the world. Conversely, livestock is associated with negative impacts on human health, animal welfare, and ecosystems. Thereby, a broad knowledge of the impacts of pasture-based beef production is essential for proposing sustainable practices and systems, particularly in Brazil, due to its importance. In this context, this study aims to assess the environmental impacts of beef production systems characteristic of different Brazilian biomes and, thus, provide baselines that support the future development of differentiated mitigation alternatives. Four systems were defined based on the relevance of the livestock activity in the Amazon, Cerrado, Pampa, and Pantanal biomes. Its main environmental impacts and components were identified using the life cycle analysis - LCA method, during the entire productive lives of the animals. GHG emissions resulted in mean values for Brazilian beef production of 13.32 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of live weight gain. The Cerrado presented higher values of terrestrial acidification, depletion of metals and fossil fuels, freshwater and marine ecotoxicity, and particulate matter formation. The Pantanal was more impacting in terms of climate change, water depletion, freshwater and marine eutrophication, and the photochemical oxidants formation. The Pampa was the region with the highest agricultural land occupation. Human toxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity were negative in all systems. Occupation of urban areas, ozone depletion, natural areas transformation, and ionizing radiation were not significant, concerning other human activities after normalization. The inclusion of different impact categories in the analysis offers new perspectives to minimize the impacts of Brazilian livestock on the planet. Pasture-based animal production systems with greater ecological, water, and carbon footprints show better results in indicators related to human health and environmental conservation. The intensification of grazing and the introduction of more productive forage species may represent new opportunities for adding value, improving life quality, and conservation of sensitive areas found in different environments that make up the diversity of Brazilian livestock production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Through advancements in technology humans have cultivated more food, used more fossil fuel reserves, polluted the environment, and caused climate change. This was not the case some few decades ago where indigenous technologies were used in exploiting natural resources. Unfortunately, the effects of climate change on the planet are no more distant reality. The melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, extreme rainfall, and prolonged drought are already being experienced. These have affected water resources, land, and food security across the world. The limits of conventional climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies call for the integration of indigenous knowledge and technologies for tackling climate change issues. This is because of the importance that indigenous knowledge and technologies have for identifying the impacts and as well providing effective adaption and mitigation strategies to climate change. Thus, this chapter explores the potential of indigenous knowledge and technologies for the sustainable management of water, land, and food security amidst climate change. The applications of indigenous technologies and knowledge such as agroforestry, the use of sacred groves to conserve water, land, and biodiversity resources, and the practising of conservation-agriculture are discussed as solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, water shortages, land degradation, and pollution. However, these indigenous technologies will be less useful in today's world if not harnessed. Thus also in this chapter, the scientific know-how available to improve the effectiveness of indigenous technologies for the sustainable use of water, land, and food resources have been identified (Robotics, sensors/detectors, internet of things) and discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Imoro, Imoro, Duwiejuah and Abukari.

AB  - Growing scientific evidence demonstrates unprecedented planetary-scale human impacts on the Earth’s system with a predicted threat to the existence of the terrestrial biosphere due to population increase, resource depletion, and pollution. Food systems account for 21–34% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Over the past half-century, water and land-use changes have significantly impacted ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles, biodiversity, and climate. At the same time, food production is falling behind consumption, and global grain reserves are shrinking. Some predictions suggest that crop yields must approximately double by 2050 to adequately feed an increasing global population without a large expansion of crop area. To achieve this, “quantum-leap” improvements in crop cultivar productivity are needed within very narrow planetary boundaries of permissible environmental perturbations. Strategies for such a “quantum-leap” include mutation breeding and genetic engineering of known crop genome sequences. Synthetic biology makes it possible to synthesize DNA fragments of any desired sequence, and modern bioinformatics tools may hopefully provide an efficient way to identify targets for directed modification of selected genes responsible for known important agronomic traits. CRISPR/Cas9 is a new technology for incorporating seamless directed modifications into genomes; it is being widely investigated for its potential to enhance the efficiency of crop production. We consider the optimism associated with the new genetic technologies in terms of the complexity of most agronomic traits, especially crop yield potential (Yp) limits. We also discuss the possible directions of overcoming these limits and alternative ways of providing humanity with food without transgressing planetary boundaries. In conclusion, we support the long-debated idea that new technologies are unlikely to provide a rapidly growing population with significantly increased crop yield. Instead, we suggest that delicately balanced humane measures to limit its growth and the amount of food consumed per capita are highly desirable for the foreseeable future. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Small scale urban green-blue infrastructure (indicated as GBI hereafter) comprises huge underexploited areas for urban development and planning. This review article aims to highlight the relevance and knowledge gaps regarding GBI from the perspective of the food–energy–water (FEW) nexus, these being key resources for the survival of human communities. In particular, this review was focused on publications on urban ecosystem services (positive effects) and dis-services (negative effects) associated with different GBI typologies. The review proved that GBI can contribute environmentally, socially, and economically to FEW security and urban sustainability. Yet, such positive effects must be considered against ecosystem dis-services tradeoffs, including urban food production, commonly connected with heavy water and energy consumption, specifically under dry climate conditions, and sometimes related to an excessive use of manure, pesticides, or fertilizers. These conditions could pose either a risk to water quality and local insect survival or serve enhanced mosquito breeding because of irrigation. Up to now, the review evidenced that few nexus modeling techniques have been discussed in terms of their benefits, drawbacks, and applications. Guidance is provided on the choice of an adequate modeling approach. Water, energy, and food are intrinsically associated physically. However, depending on their management, their tradeoffs are often increased. There is a need to minimize these tradeoffs and to build up synergies between food, energy, and water using a holistic approach. This is why the FEW nexus approach offers good insights to address the relation between three important individual resource components of sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Soil is an essential ecosystem, delivering valuable services such as the provision of food, energy and raw materials, carbon sequestration, water purification and infiltration, nutrient regulation, pest control and recreation. Therefore, soil is crucial for fighting climate change, protecting human health, safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems and ensuring food security. Pollution of the soil by organic and inorganic substances is, therefore, detrimental to ecosystem services and/or human health. Heavy metals at harmful concentrations are highly detrimental, and here, mining activities are one of the main sources of soil pollution. According to studies conducted, some of the major soil factors affecting mineral (including P) sorption are time, soil pH, soil organic matter and iron and aluminum oxides of soils. This paper looks at sources of mineral element pollution, including heavy metals, as heavy metals are toxic to all living organisms, including humans. This paper also reviews both cationic heavy metals and inorganic anionic pollutants, such as phosphate and arsenic, as well as cationic, non-heavy-metal pollutants such as nitrogen and potassium. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The Global Ecosystem and Environment Observation Analysis Research Cooperation (GEOARC) is an effort made by China to protect the global ecological environment and actively implement the 2030 sustainable development goals of the United Nations. This paper introduces the positioning and characteristics of GEOARC's work, and reviews 18 annual reports published by GEOARC from 2012 to 2018 on three topics: typical elements of global ecological environment, global key area and global ecological environment hot issues. Among them, the theme of typical elements of global ecological environment is to monitor and analyze the temporal and spatial changes of typical global ecological environment elements such as vegetation, water body and wetland by means of remote sensing, so as to help global governance, protect the life community of 'landscape, forest, field, Lake and grass' and protect the common future of the earth. The theme of the global key areas focus on the 'one belt, one road' region, developing countries and fragile ecological areas, helping to build the 'community of human destiny'. The theme of global hot issues of ecological environment mainly focus on climate change, food security, urban and rural development, etc., with the purpose of actively safeguarding the common interests of humankind. Finally, the paper summarizes the impact, objective, work plan, and key points of GEOARC. It is pointed out that GEOARC is a long-term work, which should adhere to the principles of openness, cooperation and sharing, attract the participation of the global remote sensing community, and constantly improve its international influence. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - In depositional intertidal coastal systems, primary production is dominated by benthic microalgae (microphytobenthos) inhabiting the mudflats. This benthic productivity is supporting secondary production and supplying important services to humans including food provisioning. Increased frequencies of extreme events in weather (such as heatwaves, storm surges and cloudbursts) are expected to strongly impact the spatiotemporal dynamics of the microphytobenthos and subsequently their contribution to coastal food webs. Within north-western Europe, the years 2018 and 2019 were characterized by record-breaking summer temperatures and accompanying droughts. Field-calibrated satellite data (Sentinel 2) were used to quantify the seasonal dynamics of microphytobenthos biomass and production at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution during these years. We demonstrate that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) should be used with caution in depositional coastal intertidal systems, because it may reflect import of remains of allochthonous pelagic productivity rather than local benthic biomass. We show that the reduction in summer biomass of the benthic microalgae cannot be explained by grazing but was most probably due to the high temperatures. The fivefold increase in salinity from January to September 2018, resulting from reduced river run-off during this exceptionally dry year, cannot have been without consequences for the vitality of the microphytobenthos community and its resistance to wind stress and cloud bursts. Comparison to historical information revealed that primary productivity of microphytobenthos may vary at least fivefold due to variations in environmental conditions. Therefore, ongoing changes in environmental conditions and especially extreme events because of climate change will not only lead to changes in spatiotemporal patterns of benthic primary production but also to changes in biodiversity of life under water and ecosystem services including food supply. Satellite MPB data allows for adequate choices in selecting coastal biodiversity conservation and coastal food supply. © 2021 Jacobs et al.

AB  - Background: Marked increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations are largely associated with the release of sequestered carbon in fossil fuels. While emissions of green-house gasses (GHG) from cattle have significant global warming potential, these are biogenic sources and substantially involve carbon in natural cycles, rather than fossil fuel. Cattle use human inedible feeds and by-products of human food production to produce nutrient-dense foods of great value to humans. Interventions to reduce GHG production: Reductions in land clearing and burning of grasslands and increased carbon sequestration in soils and trees have potential to substantially reduce GHG emissions. Increased efficiencies of production through intensified feeding and enteric modification have markedly reduced intensity of GHG emissions for cattle in Australia. Genetic selection for lower emissions has modest, but cumulative potential to reduce GHG (mostly CH4) emissions and intensity. Improved reproductive performance can reduce intensity of GHG emissions, especially in beef production. Feeds and technologies that reduce GHG production and intensity include improved pastures, grain feeding, dietary lipids, nitrates, ionophores, seaweed, 3-NOP, hormonal growth promotants in beef, and improved diets for peri-parturient dairy cattle. There is considerable potential to further reduce emissions from cattle using the technologies reviewed. Interventions to reduce heat stress: Cattle are susceptible to heat stress and ameliorating interventions include tree and shelter belts, shade, housing, cooling with fans and water and dietary manipulations. Conclusions: Numerous interventions can reduce GHG emissions and intensity from cattle. There are opportunities to increase carbon capture and maintain biodiversity in Australia's extensive rangelands, but these require quantification and application. We can reduce the intensity of CH4 emissions for cattle in Australia and simultaneously improve their well-being. © 2021 Australian Veterinary Association.

AB  - Tropical aquatic resources provide ecosystem services, which are affected by human activities. Human-induced environmental change in Indonesian lakes has considerably increased since the new order in 1970. In general, many Indonesian lakes had deteriorated due to sedimentation and eutrophication, which induced the blooming of aquatic plants, mostly by water hyacinth. Water security becomes a problem, particularly in the dry seasons, but water overflow and flooding occur in many places during wet seasons. Landscape and climate changes, pollution, species diversity, preserved in lake sediment, provide long-term proof of environmental changes. This paper will discuss a paleolimnological approach to reconstruct past environmental changes. Paleolimnology is learning about stratigraphy sediment of the lakes where fossils are well preserved in the sediment and provide information about the past conditions of the catchment area. Lakes' sediment records the changes in condition of the catchment area, like a diary book. Paleolimnology had been studied for Rawapening Lake and Telaga Warna Lake, Dieng. Reconstruction of the past environmental condition is required to predict future conditions. Reconstruction is an activity recreate past conditions by pointing the organism stored in layers of sediment, therefore, reflecting the environmental conditions based on organisms deposited, to develop the best sustainable water resources management, as in alignment with the concept of water - energy - food nexus. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The world faces an unprecedented crisis in water resources management, with profound implications for global food security, protection of human health, and maintenance of all ecosystems on Earth. Large uncertainties still plague quantitative assessments of climate change impacts and water resource management, but what is known for certain is that the climate is changing and that it will have an effect on water resources. Therefore, increased efforts will be needed to plan and manage water supplies in the future through increased monitoring and understanding of the interrelationships between population size, climate change, and water availability. The focus of water management is gradually shifting from developing new water sources to using existing water sources more effectively and efficiently. The world needs policy change in water management. Respect for water resources and their value is the starting point of deliberations. Governments have the essential water management function: to protect and allocate water resources to allow both individual and collective interests to benefit from water. Societies must also lead in understanding, provisioning for mitigating the impact of disasters, ranging from extreme droughts to unprecedented floods, caused by climate change and poor management of water and land. Public funds will likely remain the main source of water sectoral funding. It is up to governments to invest wisely to enhance the crucial role that water has for social and economic development in a country. Integrated water resource management strategy is accepted as a global model for achieving the objective of a sustainable water management system. © 2021 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - Industrial agriculture (IA) has been recognized among the main drivers of biodiversity loss, climate change, and native pollinator decline. Here we summarize the known negative effects of IA on pollinator biodiversity and illustrate these problems by considering the case of Chile, a “world biodiversity hotspot” (WBH) where food exports account for a considerable share of the economy in this country. Most of Chile’s WBH area is currently being replaced by IA at a fast pace, threatening local biodiversity. We present an agroecological strategy for sustainable food production and pollinator conservation in food‐producing WBHs. In this we recognize native pollinators as internal inputs that cannot be replaced by IA technological packages and support the development of agroecological and biodiversity restorative practices to protect biodiversity. We suggest four fundamental pillars for food production change based on: (1) sharing the land, restoring and protecting; (2) ecological intensification; (3) localized knowledge, research, and technological devel-opment; and (4) territorial planning and implementation of socio‐agroecological policies. This approach does not need modification of native pollination services that sustain the world with food and basic subsistence goods, but a paradigm changes where the interdependency of nature and human wellbeing must be recognized for ensuring the world’s food security and sovereignty. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Essential nutrients, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, are required for human health and development. Inadequate intake can negatively affect development and result in a wide range of adverse health outcomes. Rice, maize, and wheat provide over 60% of the world's food energy intake. Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), water, nitrogen, and soil micronutrients are the basis of this plant material. Since 1850-1900, CO2 concentrations have increased about 50%, with most of that increase since 1950. Higher CO2 concentrations increase photosynthesis, which then increases plant biomass, but also alters the nutritional quality of wheat, rice, and other C3 plants. We review the possible impacts of rising CO2 concentrations on human health, highlight uncertainties, and propose a research agenda to maintain the nutritional quality of C3 plants. We also synthesize options for addressing this critical challenge to nutritional safety and security. A complete research agenda requires addressing data and knowledge gaps surrounding plant biology and policy responses. Data on key nutrients are lacking, leading to a limited mechanistic understanding of the response of the plant ionome to elevated CO2 concentrations. Regular data are largely missing on nutritional status and food safety in low- and middle-income countries, limiting assessments of the magnitude of the risks. Research opportunities to fill gaps in data and understanding include herbaria studies, field-based natural and manipulative studies, leveraging natural plant variability, and innovations in seed quality. Improved models of cereal crop nutritional quality can project the magnitude and direction of possible future challenges; incorporating the effects of climate change into those models can further improve their robustness. Transdisciplinary research involving at least ecologists, plant physiologists, economists, and experts in human nutrition is essential for developing a systems-based understanding of the potential impacts of rising CO2 concentrations for human nutrition and the attendant consequences for achieving the sustainable development goal on food security. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Being critical to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, strengthening understanding of the properties and processes of soil at national and regional scales is imperative. The necessity to realize SDGs by 2030 also inspires a greater sense of responsibility and care for soils. Sustainable management of soil health is important to achieving several SDGs. Pertinent SDGs intricately connected with soil health include SDG 1 (End Poverty), 2 (Zero Hunger), 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), 5 (Gender Equality), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 9 (Industry Innovation and Infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), 13 (Climate Action), and 15 (Life on Land). Some of these SDGs rely considerably on plant production and others depend on soil processes. Pertinent among soil processes are water movement, heat transfer, sorption and physical filtration, ion exchange, and biochemical and biophysical transformations. In terms of specific accomplishments, 130 countries have aligned with the Zero Hunger Challenge, the globally available fresh water has decreased to 71% of needs, Technosols (soils whose formation is influenced by anthropogenic based materials) are used in urban ecosystems, food wastes are composted, specific targets of Land Degradation Neutrality have been signed by several countries, and soil C sequestration targets are widely implemented through initiatives such as the 4 Per Thousand (4P1000) initiative, Platform on Climate Action in Americas (PLACA), Adapting African Agriculture (AAA), Living Soils of the Americas (LiSAM), etc. In addition, policy and regulatory frameworks being widely promoted by several U.N. agencies (e.g., U.N. SDGs,limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2 °C) can be supported by innovations in soil science including forensic soil science, remote sensing and other innovations. Soil health is becoming a central element of the research and innovation program of the EU, aiming to reach a 75% of healthy soils by 2030. In addition, the importance of soil health to human health and environmental issues is being widely promoted through educational books on soil science and secondary schools, as well as the revision of curricula. With continuous progress in movement into the digital world, transfer and communication of knowledge of the soil sciences can improve for the end users, policymakers, and the general public but additional efforts are needed. Soil science knowledge and research forms a significant contribution to specific aspects of food and nutritional security, human wellbeing, nature conservancy, and global peace and harmony. Achieving critical SDGs by 2030 can be facilitated by soil restoration and sustainable management. © 2021

AB  - About 40% of global crop production takes place on irrigated land, which accounts for approximately 20% of the global farmland. The great majority of freshwater consumption by human societies is associated with irrigation, which contributes to a major modification of the global water cycle by enhancing evapotranspiration and reducing surface and groundwater runoff. In many regions of the world irrigation contributes to streamflow and groundwater depletion, soil salinization, cooler microclimate conditions, and altered land-atmosphere interactions. Despite the important role played by irrigation in food security, water cycle, soil productivity, and near-surface atmospheric conditions, its global extent remains poorly quantified. To date global maps of irrigated land are often based on estimates from circa year 2000. Here we apply artificial intelligence methods based on machine learning algorithms to satellite remote sensing and monthly climate data to map the spatial extent of irrigated areas between 2001 and 2015. We provide global annual maps of irrigated land at ≈9km resolution for the 2001-2015 and we make this dataset available online. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Achieving water security for humans and ecosystems is a pervasive challenge globally. Extensive areas of the Americas are at significant risk of water insecurity, resulting from global-change processes coupled with regional and local impacts. Drought, flooding, and water quality challenges pose significant threats, while at the same time, rapid urban expansion, competing water demands, river modifications, and expanding global markets for water-intensive agricultural products drive water insecurity. This paper takes a social-ecological systems perspective, aiming to identify examples and pathways towards resilient ecosystems and social development. It draws on lessons from two science-policy network projects, one focusing on water scarcity in arid and semi-arid regions of Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Peru, Mexico and the United States; and the second addressing river and lake basins as sentinels of climate variability and human effects on water quantity and quality in Canada, the United States, Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay and Chile. Together, these ‘complementary contrasts’ provide an analytical basis to empirically examine stakeholder engagement, knowledge co-production and science-policy interaction supporting decision-making to achieve water security. The paper identifies four tenets for decision-making based on water-security-focused global-change science in the Americas: 1) Decision makers should focus on protecting ecosystems because water security (along with food and energy security) depend on them; 2) Water-use and allocation decisions ought to be made considering future environmental and societal vulnerabilities, especially climate projections; 3) Holistic approaches (at basin or other appropriate levels) are best suited to ensure social-ecological system resilience and reduce vulnerability; and 4) It is essential to support local/traditional livelihoods, and underserved populations to achieve equitable water security and ecosystem resilience. © 2020

AB  - The respiratory quotient (RQ) has been used extensively as an index to evaluate metabolic energy expenditure in terrestrial animals including humans. In contrast, RQ use in understanding physiology and nutrition of aquatic ectotherms has been restricted due to technical challenges in measuring total CO2 in water. With technical advances in measuring total CO2 in water, RQ in aquatic ectotherms can be accurately determined and is potentially available as a valuable method. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of studies on RQ and metabolic energy substrate use in aquatic ectotherms. Metabolic energy substrate use is evaluated by a reliable stoichiometric bioenergetic approach, based on measuring RQ and nitrogen quotient (NQ) simultaneously. Stoichiometry provides a non-destructive and unequivocal way to quantify the instantaneous oxidation of each major energy substrate (protein, lipid or carbohydrate). This review aims to refine knowledge about bioenergetics of aquatic ectotherms under different conditions including nutritional aspects of sustainable aquaculture. Notably, stoichiometry provides a promising approach to optimize feeds and feeding regimes to realize sustainable aquaculture under differing conditions and with differing feed ingredients. It also provides an approach to consider climate change impacts and physiological adaptation mechanisms for survival and development in farmed environments and natural ecosystems. Stoichiometric bioenergetics knowledge in aquatic ectotherms has relevance to commercial impacts in the face of overfishing and food security, and ecological significance in the face of environmental change scenarios. We suggest expanding the use of stoichiometry in future bioenergetic research in emerging aquaculture species. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - The use of the ecosystem services approach for ecosystem management, including the valuation of ecosystem services, has grown in recent decades. Although a common framework is used, each ecosystem has its own characteristics. The agroecosystem, for example, is an anthropised ecosystem where ecosystem service flows are highly interrelated with the environment, positively or negatively. Therefore, agroecosystem services are usually accompanied by disservices. The valuation of agroecosystem services and disservices requires adaptation of existing ecosystem services paradigms to accommodate the innate agroecosystem idiosyncrasies. To this end, in this study, a comprehensive approach for valuation of agroecosystem services and disservices was proposed and validated in a semi-arid western Mediterranean agricultural area through stakeholder assessment, using a choice experiment. The results suggest that all categories of services (provisioning, regulating, and cultural) should be taken into account when valuing agroecosystem services and disservices. In particular, food provision (a provisioning service), water (a provisioning disservice), local climate regulation and biodiversity (regulating services), waste treatment and water purification (regulating disservices), and recreation and tourism (cultural services) are relevant for this purpose. Their relative importance in agroecosystems valuation reached 70% for agroecosystem services and 30% for disservices. Specifically, biodiversity (38%) emerged as the most relevant agroecosystem service to be valued, followed by recreation and tourism (20%), local climate regulation (7%), and food provision (5%). Among the agroecosystem disservices, water and waste treatment (15%), and water purification (15%) together contributed to 30% of the total importance. Agroecosystems should be valued considering their multifunctional character and the integration of agroecosystem services and disservices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article aims at assessing the adherence to the Brazilian legal framework of climate litigation based on the violation of human rights. The first step was to present a progressive integration between the international legal regimes of climate change and human rights, highlighting the recognition that the impacts caused by climate change on water availability, agricultural productivity and biodiversity, among others, contribute for the violation of the fundamental right to life, health, food security and access to drinking water. This article illustrates the integration between climate change litigation and human rights by describing four cases – Urgenda × government of the Netherlands, Dejusticia × government of Colombia, Leghari × government of Pakistan and Greenpeace × Commission of Human Rights of the Philippines. From this survey, the article raises, in Brazilian doctrine and jurisprudence, legal arguments that support the correlation between human rights, environmental protection and climate change. Finally, it is concluded that there are elements in Brazilian legal framework to allow the exploration of the path of climatic litigation based on violation of fundamental rights. © 2021 Editora Dom Helder.

AB  - Climate change (CC) constitutes one of the greatest threats to human health, and requires political awareness for effective and efficient adaptation planning. This study identified the perceptions of climate change and health adaptation (CC&H) among relevant stakeholders, decision-makers, and policymakers (SDPs) in Burkina Faso (BF) by determining their perceptions of CC, of related health risks and vulnerabilities, and of CC impacts on agriculture and food security. We carried out 35 semi-structured, qualitative in-depth interviews with SDPs, representing national governmental institutions, international organizations, and civil society organizations. The interviews were analyzed using content analysis. SDPs shared similar perceptions of CC and concurred with three ideas (1) CC is a real and lived experience in BF; (2) the population is aware of climatic changes in their environment; (3) CC is intertwined with the agricultural and economic development of the country. SDPs identified biodiversity loss, floods, droughts, and extreme heat as posing the highest risk to health. They elaborated five exposure pathways that are and will be affected by CC: water quality and quantity, heat stress, food supply and safety, vector borne diseases, and air quality. In conclusion, SDPs in Burkina Faso are highly aware of CC hazards, relevant health exposure pathways, and their corresponding health outcomes. Mental health and the interplay between social factors and complex health risks constitute perception gaps. SDPs perceived CC&H risks and vulnerabilities align with current evidence. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The composition and metabolic activity of the bacteria that inhabit the large intestine can have a major impact on health. Despite considerable inter-individual variation across bacterial species, the dominant phyla are generally highly conserved. There are several exogenous and gut environmental factors that play a role in modulating the composition and activities of colonic bacteria including diet with intakes of different macronutrients, including protein, accounting for approximately 20% of the microbial variation. Certain bacterial species tend to be considered as generalists and can metabolise a broad range of substrates, including both carbohydrate- and protein-derived substrates, whilst other species are specialists with a rather limited metabolic capacity. Metabolism of peptides and amino acids by gut bacteria can result in the formation of a wide range of metabolites several of which are considered deleterious to health including nitrosamines, heterocyclic amines and hydrogen sulphide as some of these products are genotoxic and have been linked to colonic disease. Beneficial metabolites however include SCFA and certain species can use amino acids to form butyrate which is the major energy source for colonocytes. The impact on health may however depend on the source of these products. In this review, we consider the impact of diet, particularly protein diets, on modulating the composition of the gut microbiota and likely health consequences and the potential impact of climate change and food security.

AB  - Many coastal communities depend on ecosystems for goods and services that contribute to human well-being. As long-standing interactions between people and nature are modified by global environmental change, dynamic and diversified livelihood strategies that enable seasonal adaptation will be critical for vulnerable coastal communities. However, the success of such strategies depends on a range of poorly understood influences. Gleaning, the hand-based collection of marine organisms from littoral habitats, provides an interesting case study of dynamic change in social-ecological interactions. It is an important coastal livelihood strategy, yet seasonal gleaning dynamics have not been empirically explored in contemporary communities. We examined seasonal gleaning in eight coastal communities on Atauro Island, Timor-Leste, using household surveys and satellite-derived maps of shallow-water benthic habitats. Our analysis explored the factors affecting household decisions to glean in each season, the relationship between gleaning and seafood consumption, and seasonal gleaning pressure on near-shore coastal resources. Dynamic marine harvesting strategies differed among households and gleaning activity was seasonally heterogeneous. Not all gleaning households gleaned during the season characterised by rough sea conditions despite rough season gleaning being associated with greater seafood consumption stability among seasons. Households also gleaned less regularly, and catches were smaller, in the rough season. Differences in seasonal participation in gleaning were explained mostly by type and extent of shallow habitat proximate to a community. In the calm season, household gleaning was positively related to the total area of shallow habitat, and in the rough season the percentage of hard-bottom shallow habitat was also an important predictor of gleaning activity. Our findings illustrate how changes in the biophysical environment mediate human–nature interactions at fine scales through time and space. Consequently, this research highlights the importance of context-specific perspectives for understanding drivers and dynamics in fishing pressure on littoral ecosystems, access to ecosystem benefits and limits to adaptation. Factors influencing when livelihood activities are feasible and desirable are important for evaluating the social impacts of climate change, particularly in the context of rural communities in the Global South.

AB  - The world’s ever-growing population presents a major challenge in providing sustainable food options and in reducing pressures on the Earth’s agricultural land and freshwater resources. Current estimates suggest that agriculture contributes ~30% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Additionally, there is an increased demand for animal protein, the production of which is particularly polluting. Therefore, the climate-disrupting potential of feeding the planet is likely to substantially worsen in the future. Due to the nutritional value of animal-based protein, it is not a simple solution to recommend a wholesale reduction in production/consumption of animal proteins. Rather, employing strategies which result in the production of low carbon animal protein may be part of the solution to reduce the GHGs associated with our diets without compromising diet quality. We suggest that farmed mussels may present a partial solution to this dilemma. Mussel production has a relatively low GHG production and does not put undue pressure on land or fresh water supplies. By drawing comparisons to other protein sources using the Australian Food and Nutrient Database and other published data, we demonstrate that they are a sustainable source of high-quality protein, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, phytosterols, and other key micronutrients such as B-12 and iron. The aim of this review is to summarise the current knowledge on the health benefits and potential risks of increasing the consumption of farmed mussels. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The sustainability of producing biodiesel from waste cooking oil (WCO) needs to be thoroughly examined since it is a promising multiple-advantage solution to strengthening energy security, promoting a circular economy, minimizing waste and environmental pollution, and safeguarding food safety. In this study, we employed life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) modeling to evaluate the environmental impacts and economic competitiveness of biodiesel production from WCO in China. The endpoint impacts, including the damage to human health, ecosystem quality, and resource availability, and relevant midpoint impacts were examined. The results show that compared to conventional fossil diesel, the overall endpoint environmental impacts of WCO-based biodiesel are lower, particularly in terms of resource depletion. However, for the midpoint impacts, WCO-based biodiesel has higher impacts on climate change, particulate matter generation, photochemical oxidant formation, human toxicity, and water depletion. The majority of the environmental impacts are due to transesterification, except for water depletion, which is mainly derived from the transportation of the biodiesel fuel. The LCC of the biodiesel is estimated to be 6460 RMB per ton, which is about 31% higher than that of fossil diesel (4921 RMB per ton). The LCC of WCO-based biodiesel is mainly determined by the WCO collection, with a share of 83%. The high purchasing price of WCO feedstock and the fluctuations in international oil prices lead to difficulties in biodiesel industry development. Additionally, the multiple consumers of WCO, the low energy conversion rate, and the immature utilization of the by-products also hinder the massive deployment of WCO-based biodiesel in China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increasing distribution and prevalence of fasciolosis in both human and livestock are concerning. Here, we examine the various types of factors influencing fasciolosis transmission and burden and the interrelations that may exist between them. We present the arsenal of molecules, 'adjusting' capabilities and parasitic strategies of Fasciola to infect. Such features define the high adaptability of Fasciola species for parasitism that facilitate their transmission. We discuss current environmental perturbations (increase of livestock and land use, climate change, introduction of alien species and biodiversity loss) in relation to fasciolosis dynamics. As Fasciola infection is directly and ultimately linked to livestock management, living conditions and cultural habits, which are also changing under the pressure of globalization and climate change, the social component of transmission is also discussed. Lastly, we examine the implication of increasing scientific and political awareness in highlighting the current circulation of fasciolosis and boosting epidemiological surveys and novel diagnostic techniques. From a joint perspective, it becomes clear that factors weight differently at each place and moment, depending on the biological, environmental, social and political interrelating contexts. Therefore, the analyses of a disease as complex as fasciolosis should be as integrative as possible to dissect the realities featuring each epidemiological scenario. Such a comprehensive appraisal is presented in this review and constitutes its main asset to serve as a fresh integrative understanding of fasciolosis. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The United Nations General Assembly declared 2021-2030 as the "Decade of Ecosystem Restoration", which positions "the restoration of ecosystems as a major nature-based solution towards meeting a wide range of global development goals and national priorities". Ecological restoration, when it was implemented effectively, contributes to improving food and water security, mitigating climate change, protecting biodiversity, boosting economic prosperity and benefiting human health and well-being. Thus, ecological restoration is fundamental for the success of ecological civilization and sustainable development. Ecological restoration theories in developed countries usually require restoring the ecosystem to the status prior to degradation, and this requirement is difficult to achieve in regions with serious degradation, especially in developing countries. We developed a new theory of ecological restoration, or stepwise ecological restoration (STERE), which comprises three modes in different restoration stages: Environmental remediation in the initial stage with serious degradation, ecological rehabilitation for moderately degraded ecosystems, and natural restoration for slightly degraded ecosystems. Environmental remediation aims to reduce environmental pollution through the removal or detoxification of pollutants or excess nutrients from soil and water. Ecological rehabilitation is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed through various physical, chemical and biological restoration strategies. Natural restoration aims to restore ecosystem functions and services and improve ecosystem resilience without much human assistance. Environmental remediation is fundamental and needs to be implemented prior to ecological rehabilitation and natural restoration in places where pollution is severe. Only the former is successfully carried out; however, when the ecosystem is moderately degraded, ecological rehabilitation can be effectively implemented. In places where the ecosystem is slightly degraded, natural restoration is recommended. The processes of ecological rehabilitation and natural restoration will result in ecological functions that are more complete, an increase in biodiversity, and improved ecosystem resilience. For STERE, appropriate restoration goals should be formulated based on the degree of degradation, local funding support, and technological development. The new theory proposed in this study emphasizes the application of reference ecosystems in restoration projects and the importance of ecological monitoring. It also requires an adaptive restoration management framework that considers the influence of global climate change. STERE should be implemented for future ecosystems rather than only for restoring an ecosystem to a status similar to the condition prior to degradation. Moreover, STERE promotes systematic large-scale landscape restoration by considering the interactions between individual small scales (e.g., field scale) and large scales (e.g., catchment scale). In addition, technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles and remote sensing should be more widely used in future STERE projects. Ecological restoration databases should be established for restorative activities in mountains, waters, forests, farms, lakes and other ecosystems. The newly proposed STERE theory would play an important role in developing restoration projects worldwide, especially in developing countries. © 2021, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - The sustainability of aquaculture has been debated intensely since 2000, when a review on the net contribution of aquaculture to world fish supplies was published in Nature. This paper reviews the developments in global aquaculture from 1997 to 2017, incorporating all industry sub-sectors and highlighting the integration of aquaculture in the global food system. Inland aquaculture—especially in Asia—has contributed the most to global production volumes and food security. Major gains have also occurred in aquaculture feed efficiency and fish nutrition, lowering the fish-in–fish-out ratio for all fed species, although the dependence on marine ingredients persists and reliance on terrestrial ingredients has increased. The culture of both molluscs and seaweed is increasingly recognized for its ecosystem services; however, the quantification, valuation, and market development of these services remain rare. The potential for molluscs and seaweed to support global nutritional security is underexploited. Management of pathogens, parasites, and pests remains a sustainability challenge industry-wide, and the effects of climate change on aquaculture remain uncertain and difficult to validate. Pressure on the aquaculture industry to embrace comprehensive sustainability measures during this 20-year period have improved the governance, technology, siting, and management in many cases. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Globally, the livelihoods of over a billion people are affected by changes to marine eco-systems, both structurally and systematically. Resources and ecosystem services, provided by the marine environment, contribute nutrition, income, and health benefits for communities. One threat to these securities is ciguatera poisoning; worldwide, the most commonly reported non‐bacterial seafood‐related illness. Ciguatera is caused by the consumption of (primarily) finfish contaminated with ciguatoxins, potent neurotoxins produced by benthic single‐cell microalgae. When consumed, ciguatoxins are biotransformed and can bioaccumulate throughout the food‐web via complex path-ways. Ciguatera‐derived food insecurity is particularly extreme for small island‐nations, where fear of intoxication can lead to fishing restrictions by region, species, or size. Exacerbating these com-plexities are anthropogenic or natural changes occurring in global marine habitats, e.g., climate change, greenhouse‐gas induced physical oceanic changes, overfishing, invasive species, and even the international seafood trade. Here we provide an overview of the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century regarding the many facets of ciguatera, including the complex nature of this illness, the biological/environmental factors affecting the causative organisms, their toxins, vectors, detection methods, human‐health oriented responses, and ultimately an outlook towards the future. Ciguatera research efforts face many social and environmental challenges this century. However, several future‐oriented goals are within reach, including digital solutions for seafood supply chains, identifying novel compounds and methods with the potential for advanced diagnostics, treatments, and prediction capabilities. The advances described herein provide confidence that the tools are now available to answer many of the remaining questions surrounding ciguatera and therefore protection measures can become more accurate and routine. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Soil ecosystem services (ES) (e.g., provisioning, regulation/maintenance, and cultural) and ecosystem disservices (ED) are dependent on soil diversity/pedodiversity (variability of soils), which needs to be accounted for in the economic analysis and business decision-making. The concept of pedodiversity (biotic + abiotic) is highly complex and can be broadly interpreted because it is formed from the interaction of atmospheric diversity (abiotic + biotic), biodiversity (biotic), hydrodiversity (abiotic + biotic), and lithodiversity (abiotic) within ecosphere and the anthroposphere. Pedodiversity is influenced by intrinsic (within the soil) and extrinsic (outside soil) factors, which are also relevant to ES/ED. Pedodiversity concepts and measures may need to be adapted to the ES framework and business applications. Currently, there are four main approaches to analyze pedodiversity: taxonomic (diversity of soil classes), genetic (diversity of genetic horizons), parametric (diversity of soil properties), and functional (soil behavior under different uses). The objective of this article is to illustrate the application of pedodiversity concepts and measures to value ES/ED with examples based on the contiguous United States (U.S.), its administrative units, and the systems of soil classification (e.g., U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Taxonomy, Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database). This study is based on a combination of original research and literature review examples. Taxonomic pedodiversity in the contiguous U.S. exhibits high soil diversity, with 11 soil orders, 65 suborders, 317 great groups, 2026 subgroups, and 19,602 series. The ranking of “soil order abundance” (area of each soil order within the U.S.) expressed as the proportion of the total area is: (1) Mollisols (27%), (2) Alfisols (17%), (3) Entisols (14%), (4) Inceptisols and Aridisols (11% each), (5) Spodosols (3%), (6) Vertisols (2%), and (7) Histosols and Andisols (1% each). Taxonomic, genetic, parametric, and functional pedodiversity are an essential context for analyzing, interpreting, and reporting ES/ED within the ES framework. Although each approach can be used separately, three of these approaches (genetic, parametric, and functional) fall within the “umbrella” of taxonomic pedodiversity, which separates soils based on properties important to potential use. Extrinsic factors play a major role in pedodiversity and should be accounted for in ES/ED valuation based on various databases (e.g., National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) databases). Pedodiversity is crucial in identifying soil capacity (pedocapacity) and “hotspots” of ES/ED as part of business decision making to provide more sustainable use of soil resources. Pedodiversity is not a static construct but is highly dynamic, and various human activities (e.g., agriculture, urbanization) can lead to soil degradation and even soil extinction. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - How are our cities using nature‐based solutions to confront the challenges posed by a warming climate, the loss of biodiversity and major resource depletion? This article discusses the opportunities and benefits of applying the concepts of regreening and rewilding of cities. The article engages with key sources and summarizes the background and development of regreening and nature‐based solutions and important policies, concerns and perspectives of international and national organizations. It introduces the integration of nature‐based solutions (NBS) as a strategy in urban planning with the aim to strengthen urban resilience and to slow down the biodiversity de-cline. Rewilding areas in cities has become a powerful strategy to bring back butterflies, insects, birds, and wildlife. In contrast to highly managed parks and gardens, these rewilding initiatives are leaving allotted spaces mostly uncultivated and self‐regulated. Contact to nature is essential for human existence, urban wellbeing, and good quality of life. Green spaces in cities—big or small—all contribute to the health and wellbeing of residents. However, many cities do not offer residents easy access to green space within the city. Improving the better distribution of and access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks is likely to deliver a large number of benefits, such as: ecosystem services, better water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, and restoring damaged ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and NBS help to keep cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microcli-mate. Rewilding has emerged as an important part of new public parks and gardens. The next step is to up‐scale citywide climate intervention strategies deployed to keep cities cool. However, as the discussion of this article shows, it is essential that the design of these NBS strategies is fully integrated with other complementary planning interventions and seeks synergies across all sectors. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - Climate change is having a substantial impact on our environment and ecosystems and has altered the way humans live, access, and utilize resources with increased risk of zoonotic infectious disease encounters. As global temperatures continue to increase, they impact on public health, migration, food security and land conflict, and as new environments become favorable, exposure to disease carrying vectors. Increased forests or natural habitat clearance for land repurposing, urbanization, road building, and water management are related to an increase in emerging vector borne parasitic diseases. The East African region remains one of the most impacted regions globally for leishmaniasis, a vector borne disease that impacts significantly on the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of affected communities and for which a lack of reporting and control interventions hinder progress toward elimination of this neglected tropical disease. As our world continues to transform, both politically and climatically, it is essential that measures are put in place to improve surveillance and disease management with implementation of control measures, including vector control, especially in low- and middle-income countries that are expected to be most impacted by changes in climate. Only through effective management, now, can we be sufficiently resilient to preventing the inevitable spread of vectors into suitable habitat and expansion of the geographical range of leishmaniasis. This review offers a current perspective on Leishmaniasis as an endemic disease in East Africa and examines the potential of the recent emergence of Leishmania infection in hitherto unaffected regions to become a public health concern if no disease management is achieved. © Copyright © 2021 Jones and Welburn.

AB  - Beekeeping provides honey, protein-containing drone broods and pollen, and yield-increasing pollination services. This study tested the hypothesis that beekeeping can result in net-positive impacts, if pollination services and protein-containing by-products are utilised. As a case example, Finnish beekeeping practices were used. The study was performed using two different approaches. In both approaches, the evaluated impacts were related to climate change, land use, and freshwater use, and were scaled down to represent one beehive. The first approach considered honey production with pollination services and the replacement of alternative products with co-products. The impacts were normalised to correspond with planetary boundary criteria. The second approach evaluated the impacts of the different products and services of beekeeping separately. In the first approach the honey production system moved towards a safe operational space. Freshwater use was the impact category with the largest shift towards a safe operational space (39% shift). The second approach caused a global warming potential of honey production of 0.65 kgCO2-eq kg−1, when pollen and drone broods were considered as by-products and the influence of pollination services were not included. When honey, pollen, and drone broods were considered as co-products and pollination services were included, the impacts regarding land use and climate change were net-positive. The impact of freshwater use was relatively small. For honey, the impacts on the climate change, land use, and freshwater use were −0.33 kgCO2-eq kg−1, −7.89 m2 kg−1, and 14.01 kg kg−1, respectively. The impact allocation with co-products and pollination services was conclusive. A lack of consideration for the impact reduction of pollination led to beekeeping having a negative impact on the environment. Based on these results, beekeeping enhances food security within planetary boundaries, provided that pollination services and protein-containing by-/co-products are utilised. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Agroecosystems are the largest human-natural coupled production system covering ~40% of the planet earth and provide essential ecosystem services for a good quality of life and human wellbeing. The sustainable management of agroecosystems are therefore essential for meeting the food, fuel, fiber, and fodder demands of the rapidly growing human population. Agroecosystems also play a key role in trace gases emission, and also affect the quality and usage of life-supporting resources such as air, water, soil etc. Though the sustainable management of agroecosystems are imperative for achieving UN-Sustainable Development Goals, they are frequently under degradation due to multiple drivers of changes such as unsustainable land-use practices, biodiversity loss, pollution and climate change, etc. Therefore, cordial efforts at national, regional and global levels are essential for managing agroecosystems to meet out the global goals and also the targets of the United Nations- Decade o-n Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030). Here we opined various strategies for restoring degraded agroecosystems for sustainable development including the adoption of emerging paradigms such as micro-agriculture, urban agriculture, and landless agriculture for averting the mounting pressure on agroecosystems for the benefit of both people and the planet. © 2020

AB  - The natural ecosystems provide services that are crucial for our survival as climate control, food and water security. A very persistent pattern is loss of biodiversity caused by human activities all over the world, mainly due to deforestation and agricultural expansion. One very important challenge for human societies is to find the equilibrium between economic growth and environmental sustainability. In this contribution we address the role developed by spatial heterogeneity due to resource distribution and fragmentation on the species diversity. We propose a spatial model in which species compete on a lattice that is divided in habitats containing different amount of resources. The landscape here is a fractal structure which changes gradually from highly fragmented to highly clumped. Fractal landscapes are constructed through the use of fractional Brownian motion and characterized by the Hurst exponent. We found from our simulation results that there is an optimum number of habitats in which the fragmentation level has no effect. As habitat number drift away from optimal value, fragmentation has a growing effect on biodiversity promotion, mostly for small values of the Hurst exponent H. We observed two power law regimes describing the species–area relationship, in which the exponent for small areas is always smaller than the one observed for large areas. We also observe for the majority of the cases we studied, that the value of species–area exponent in both regimes grows with the number of habitats and then drops when the number of habitats becomes large. The number of habitats revealed to be the most important variable to foster and control the biodiversity in all scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecological Security Pattern (ESP) is considered to be one of the important spatial approaches to alleviate the contradiction between ecological protection and economic development, thereby ensuring regional security and maintaining socially sustainable access to ecosystem services. Multiple ecosystem services have widely been coupled to explore the ESP in recent years. Generally speaking, most previous studies reported that there was no trade-off relationship between ecosystem services, where different ecological processes were independent of each other. In the process of ecological node identification, it is often ignored to identify the ecological obstacle points that hinder the movement or communication between organisms, or the ecological pinch points that are more likely or very frequent in the process of biological migration. The Yellow River Basin is the main birthplace of Chinese civilization, serving as an important ecological barrier in China. It is necessary to identify the patches and corridors on regional ecological security and optimize the ecological space, thereby improving the ecosystem service function for the high-quality development of the basin. In this study, five typical ecosystem services were selected: the food supply, carbon sequestration, oxygen release, water production, and soil conservation in the Gansu section of the Yellow River Basin in 2019. A multi-scenario Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) model was used to evaluate the priority protection areas of ecosystem service in the study area in 2019 as the ecological source areas. The minimum cumulative resistance model was used to construct the basic resistance surface. The circuit theory model was selected to extract the ecological corridor and identify the ecological pinch points. The ESP was constructed for the Gansu section of the Yellow River basin with the ecological source as the core, the ecological protection priority areas with different gradients as the benchmark framework, and the ecological corridor pinch points as the axis. An optimal ecological space was achieved during the optimization. The results showed that there were 169 ecological source patches in the study area, with an area of 27 460.56 km2, accounting for 19.2% of the total study area. Five ecosystem services showed a collaborative relationship from an overall perspective. Three natural regions of Gannan Plateau, Longzhong Plateau, and Longdong Loess Plateau were significantly affected by topographic climate, vegetation cover, and human activities. There were some differences in ecosystem services in different regions. In the combination of rank weight, seven schemes were given for the ecosystem service protection, where the extracted priority reserve was the core and comprehensiveness of ecological sources, to achieve the goal of high efficiency and balanced allocation of ecosystem service protection. Considering the trade-off degree (0.935), the priority conservation areas under scenario 4 were selected as the ecological source of the study areas. The minimum cumulative resistance model was used to identify the ecological corridor, whereas, the circuit model was introduced to identify the spatial scope of the ecological corridor. A total of 441 ecological corridors with a length of 6 774.9 km were identified in the study area. 49 ecological pinch points were identified by the current density of the ecological corridor. An optimal system was proposed for the space layout of ecological safety in the Gansu section of the Yellow River Basin with "four axes, six regions, and multiple centers", in order to form an ecological space structure with the functional, networked and regional layout. The findings can provide decision-making support for sustainable and ecosystem management in the upstream ecosystem of the Yellow River Basin. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Agro-industries should adopt effective strategies to use agrochemicals such as glyphosate herbicides cautiously in order to protect public health. This entails careful testing and risk assessment of available choices, and also educating farmers and users with mitigation strategies in ecosystem protection and sustainable development. The key to success in this endeavour is using scientific research on biological pest control, organic farming and regulatory control, etc., for new developments in food production and safety, and for environmental protection. Education and research is of paramount importance for food and nutrition security in the shadow of climate change, and their consequences in food production and consumption safety and sustainability. This review, therefore, diagnoses on the use of glyphosate and the associated development of glyphosate-resistant weeds. It also deals with the risk assessment on human health of glyphosate formulations through environment and dietary exposures based on the impact of glyphosate and its metabolite AMPA –(aminomethyl)phosphonic acid– on water and food. All this to setup further conclusions and recommendations on the regulated use of glyphosate and how to mitigate the adverse effects. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In 2015, the Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission launched a report introducing a novel approach called Planetary Health and proposed a concept, a strategy and a course of action. To discuss the concept of Planetary Health in the context of Europe, a conference entitled: “Europe That Protects: Safeguarding Our Planet, Safeguarding Our Health” was held in Helsinki in December 2019. The conference participants concluded with a need for action to support Planetary Health during the 2020s. The Helsinki Declaration emphasizes the urgency to act as scientific evidence shows that human activities are causing climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation, overuse of natural resources and pollution. They threaten the health and safety of human kind. Global, regional, national, local and individual initiatives are called for and multidisciplinary and multisectorial actions and measures are needed. A framework for an action plan is suggested that can be modified for local needs. Accordingly, a shift from fragmented approaches to policy and practice towards systematic actions will promote human health and health of the planet. Systems thinking will feed into conserving nature and biodiversity, and into halting climate change. The Planetary Health paradigm ‒ the health of human civilization and the state of natural systems on which it depends ‒ must become the driver for all policies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - While it is increasingly important to strengthen the existing knowledge base in Africa to adequately respond to the rising risks and impacts of climate change on water resources, a significant research gap remains to identify areas and mechanisms to cope with these societal challenges. The aim of the paper is twofold: i) to provide subject-specific insights by analyzing the current knowledge base in Africa given water-related challenges due to climate change, and ii) to offer methodological insights into how a knowledge base can be studied comprehensively. This study overcomes the limitations of existing studies by combining two different perspectives, namely a thematic focus on six societal challenges and a conceptual focus on five social innovation dimensions. It does so by undertaking an innovative qualitative analysis that combines both top-down and bottom-up perspectives. Top-down, it explores the extent to which five social innovation dimensions are included and addressed in policy agendas and action plans. Bottom-up, it explores the perception of African experts and practitioners in how these knowledge gaps should be addressed. The research identifies a strong bias in the policy arena towards water security versus other water-related societal challenges. Our research suggests that rather than focusing on traditional policy instruments, water-related societal challenges should be addressed by joint attention to all five social innovation dimensions. There is a strong call from practitioners and experts towards strengthening the existing knowledge base by engaging local realities and local stakeholders and for the involvement of business and private sector actors. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - A great portion of Earth's freshwater and land resources are salt-affected and thus have restricted use or may become unsuitable for most human activities. Some of the recent scenarios warn that environmental salinization processes will continue to be exacerbated due to global climate change. The most relevant implications and side-effects in ecosystems under excessive salinity are destructive and long lasting (e.g. soil dispersion, water/soil hypersalinity, desertification, ruined biodiversity), often with non-feasible on site remediation, especially at larger scales. Agro-ecosystems are very sensitive to salinization; after a certain threshold is reached, yields and food quality start to deteriorate sharply. Additionally, salinity often coincides with numerous other environmental constrains (drought, waterlogging, pollution, acidity, nutrient deficiency, etc.) that progressively aggravate the threat to food security and general ecosystem resilience. Some well-proven, widely-used and cost-effective traditional ameliorative strategies (e.g. conservation agriculture, application of natural conditioners) help against salinity and other constraints, especially in developing countries. Remotely-sensed and integrated data of salt-affected areas combined with in situ and lab-based observations have never been so easy and rapid to acquire, precise and applicable on huge scales, representing a valuable tool for policy-makers and other stakeholders in implementing targeted measures to control and prevent ecosystem degradation (top-to-bottom approach). Continued progress in biotechnology and ecoengineering offers some of the most advanced and effective solutions against salinity (e.g. nanomaterials, marker-assisted breeding, genome editing, plant-microbial associations), albeit many knowledge gaps and ethical frontiers remain to be overcome before a successful transfer of these potential solutions to the industrial-scale food production can be effective. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large exports of land-based contaminants to the ocean exacerbate the effects of climate change, pollute ocean waters, disrupt biogeochemical cycles, harm marine organisms, and consequently jeopardise food security and the livelihoods of ocean-dependent communities. The Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) is characterised by a mix of the Atlantic Ocean basin waters, reverse flow from the Mediterranean Sea, and inland waters from adjacent countries. This biodiversityrich ecosystem is a source of ecosystem goods and services that provide sustenance for populations in the coastal states of West Africa and beyond. However, with the ocean surface warming, ocean productivity and fisheries’ outputs have declined across multiple trophic levels. Therefore, in this diagnostic study based on a systematic literature review (publications from 2009 to 2020), we (a) provide an integrative assessment of the CCLME with the exception of Morocco, in the context of the modular large marine ecosystem framework using the categories ‘environmental’ (productivity, fish and fisheries, pollution, and ecosystem health) and ‘non-environmental’ (socioeconomic and governance), and (b) identify knowledge gaps and data scarce regions. The key drivers of change in the CCLME were identified as fishing pressure, land-based pollution, coastal habitat loss, and climate change. Productivity, land-based pollution, and ecosystem health were priority areas for data collection in the CCLME, with data deficiencies particularly apparent in The Gambia and Guinea. Therefore, to mitigate further degradation and accelerate progress toward sustainable management of the CCLME, research should be conducted in these priority areas of data deficiency. Furthermore, as most drivers of change in this ecosystem are related to weak management and a lack of regulatory enforcement, we recommend effective implementation, monitoring, and enforcement of existing national and transboundary regulations, as well as ecosystem-based human-centred management approaches, as proactive strategies for decoupling anthropogenic disturbances from climate change and optimising the productivity of the CCLME. © 2021 The authors.

AB  - On the path of economic development, sustainable waste management is a difficult step. Especially in low-income countries where management systems are imperfect managed, with low infrastructure and public awareness, lead the country to critical out comes. Landfills in Georgia, with few exceptions, do not meet international standards. In addition, spontaneous, illegal landfills are being created in the villages. Residents dump their waste into the water, on the river banks, near agricultural lands, in a ravine. Uncontrolled waste releases compounds harmful to health, including heavy metals such as lead, zinc, arsenic, cadmium. Soil and plants absorb and retain contaminants. Heavy metals accumulate in the soil, then migrate to groundwater or surface waters and meet in the food chain. They have a serious impact on the soil microflora as they can change its composition and negatively affect current processes. In an already small country, fertile soils and the production of healthy food are declining. In Kakheti region (Georgia) in Gurjaani municipality at two locations: in Gurjaani itself and in the vicinity of village Arashenda, field research was conducted and samples were collected by The Auger Method, which was then processed in the laboratory and heavy metals were determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. Soil reaction (pH), lead, copper, zinc, cadmium and organic matter were determined in soil samples. The study showed that the concentration and toxicity of heavy metals at the waste disposal site increases. The predominant metal is zinc, which is an important element for plants and the normal functioning of the body, but its excessive amount is already toxic. 1 g of zinc sulfate ZnSO4 can cause poisoning. In the examined samples it can be said that zinc is on the alarming edge. On the example of the Gurjaani landfill and the village Arashenda, we can conclude that unsystematic, non-segregated waste causes the absorption of heavy metals in the soil, while soil type and climate contribute to its accumulation or solubility. In addition to having a severe impact on human health, heavy metals also reduce soil productivity. Therefore, the study of the accumulation and migration of heavy metals in soils is currently a very important and topical issue. © 2021 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

AB  - Environmental problems such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, deforestation, air and water pollution, or the sealing of soils are urgent problems of humankind. They have been on the political agenda for many years but sustainable solutions and improvements are still missing in most areas. Many of these problems require technical solutions such as efficient ways to produce enough energy, housing, and food for an increasing world population. However, environmental problems are caused by humans, and it is only through a change of human behavior that they can be solved. These changes require that humans change the way they generate and use energy, substituting coal, oil, and gas by renewable energy sources. Moreover, adopting new technologies might not be enough but must go hand in hand with changes in lifestyle, reductions in consumption, reductions in mobility, and reductions in the use of land. The required changes will probably include all areas of life including our nutrition and how we grow food. © Axel Franzen and Sebastian Mader 2021.

AB  - The rapid rise in human population has brought about an urgent deployment of biological technologies for the improvement of crop productivity and attainment of global food and nutrition security. The overdependence on chemical fertilizers (especially nitrogen-based fertilizer) for intensive and commercial agriculture has been associated with emerging environmental hazards and climate change. High nitrogen fertilizer usage has resulted into nitrous oxide emissions, as well as pollution of ground water through nitrogen leaching. The direct and indirect utilization of beneficial microbial resources as the next generation of biofertilizers is rapidly gaining attention as a sustainable technology for the production of eco-friendly alternatives to synthetic fertilizers. Biofertilizers are revered for their capacity to improve crop productivity, guarantee food safety, enhance soil microbial diversity, and promote soil nutrients and organic matter. Integrating this technology with molecular re-engineering or genetic modification has greatly facilitated the efficiency of such beneficial microbial strains that include cyanobacteria, fungi, bacteria, and microalgae, that are common sources of biofertilizers. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Water Balance Assessment is a methodological approach developed and applied by Eni for the identification of improvements in water management at site level. The approach is based on three steps. The following report describes each step and the application of the approach to a real case study in Tunisia. Water is a vital resource for our planet and for humankind. Biodiversity and ecosystems' preservation, human health, and food security as well as energy production, industrial development and economic growth are all dependent on water. The consequences of climate change and the actual projections of increasing water demand will affect water availability and quality in the coming years. About the Oil & Gas sector, this industry consumes and produces significant volumes of water. For this reason, energy companies must consider sustainable options for the use of this resource, especially in water stress areas. This can be achieved through: • A deep knowledge of the site water streams and of the context where the site is located. • Identification of improvements and initiatives that could reduce the water risk of the site. About water safeguarding, Eni is committed to pursue the following practices: • Water Conservation: Upstream Oil & Gas operations need significant quantities of water; a key element for its conservation includes the reduction of withdrawals and the efficiency in water use. • Water Reuse and Valorization: Upstream Oil & Gas operations must manage large volumes of wastewater, mainly Produced Water. Design solutions shall introduce and maximize the recycle of water with the adoption of suitable treatments, to make discharges compatible with the reuse in the same production cycle or by third parties (e.g., other plants, local communities), and pursue the opportunity to reuse industrial water, instead of discharging it as wastewater. For their deployment, Eni has defined and applied a methodological approach to support the definition of improvement and optimization initiatives of water management at the site level. The approach represents an application of a "convergence approach" which, starting from an overall view of the site, identifies opportunities, further and more detailed areas of analysis, and design projects that can improve water use, management, and reuse. The methodological approach is based on the following steps: • A country-based framework study on water resources, and water-related risks analysis at country and local level. • A Water Balance Assessment, gathering water qualitative and quantitative information and site framework details. • Definition of site initiatives for wastewater reuse and valorization, and for the optimization of water withdrawals, based on the above steps and considering local legislation. Through this approach, operational water risks exposure is analyzed in detail, allowing to address a wide range of opportunities for the improvement of water management, also through the development of new synergies with local communities. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers

AB  - Land degradation continues to be an enormous challenge to human societies, reducing food security, emitting greenhouse gases and aerosols, driving the loss of biodiversity, polluting water, and undermining a wide range of ecosystem services beyond food supply and water and climate regulation. Climate change will exacerbate several degradation processes. Investment in diverse restoration efforts, including sustainable agricultural and forest land management, as well as land set aside for conservation wherever possible, will generate co-benefits for climate change mitigation and adaptation and morebroadly for human and societal well-being and the economy. This review highlights the magnitude of the degradation problem and some of the key challenges for ecological restoration. There are biophysical as well as societal limits to restoration. Better integrating policies to jointly address poverty, land degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions and removals is fundamental to reducing many existing barriers and contributing to climate-resilient sustainable development. © 2021 Annual Reviews Inc..

AB  - In recent years climate change and its impacts have become a separate field of inquiry. Climate-related risks to food security, water supply, biodiversity and human health are expected to increase with further global warming. The purpose of this study is to show how the definition of food security in particular has changed in times of climate change. It is a multidimensional phenomenon that has no legal definition so far. Associated mainly with physical access to food, food security was identified as a global problem by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 1975 at the Word Food Conference. At the European Union level, food security is strictly connected with the Common Agriculture Policy. One of the new aims of that policy is to make agriculture more sustainable and responsive to current and future challenges, including climate variability. There is the dual challenge of both adapting production systems to new conditions and reducing greenhouse gases produced by agriculture. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2021

AB  - Poverty, food insecurity and environmental degradation are the recurrent problems in the Ganga River Basin (GRB). The Ganga River enriches the fertility of floodplain through flooding every year. Farmers have been utilizing this fertility for growing crops by flood recession farming (FRF) since antiquity. In this practice, farmers use moisture and nutrient rich soil of the floodplains for growing crops after water levels recede and harvest them before flooding in the river. This ancient method of food production plays a pivotal role in human well-being and environmental conservation in the GRB. Using the data collected from the farmers living along the Ganga River in Varanasi, this study explores the potentials of FRF through the dimensions of livelihood provision, food security and environmental sustainability. Field visits, household surveys, and focus group discussions (FGDs) were used to collect data. Results indicated that various practices and methods of FRF system underpin not only the livelihood and food security of small and marginal farmers but also enrich the sustainability of the environment. Environmental sustainability was assessed in the context of agro-biodiversity conservation, water resource management, soil health maintenance, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. The study concludes that the full potentials of flood recession farming can be assessed through a comprehensive research about the different aspects of FRF and mainstreaming this practice in policy-making for sustainable food production. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - How are our cities confronting the challenges posed by a warming climate, the loss of biodiversity and major resource depletion? ―This article discusses the opportunities and benefits of applying the concepts of renaturalisiation and rewilding of cities. It introduces Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in urban planning that are integrated with the aim to enhance urban resilience and to slow down the biodiversity decline, which can be applied in two areas: through the conception of new green neighbourhoods; and through the regeneration and re-greening of existing but neglected parts of the city, such as postindustrial brownfields or economically weak districts. Contact to nature is essential for human existence, urban wellbeing and a good quality of life. Green spaces in cities –big or small– all contribute to health and wellbeing. However, many cities, including in the U.S. and in Europe, do not offer residents easy access to green space within the city. Improving better access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks will deliver a large number of benefits, such as ecosystem services, better water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, with the potential to restore damaged ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and NBS help to keep cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microclimate. As most of our cities keep growing and warming, the scale of the issue is significant. For example, in 2020, cities in the European Union were home to over 70 percent of Europe’s population, and this figure is expected to increase to over 80 percent by the middle of the century. This translates to 36 million new urban citizens in Europe by 2050 alone, who will need housing, employment, health care and access to green spaces (EU-Commission, 2018). In this context, nature-based solutions and re-greening can generate significant benefits for citizens, improve urban health and well-being, and offer an opportunity to effectively deploy nature in helping to resolve major societal challenges ―such as social inclusion, food security and disaster risk reduction. However, as the discussion of this article shows, it is essential that the design of NBS is fully integrated with other complementary planning interventions and seeks synergies across all sectors. © The author; licensee Universidad de la Costa - CUC.

AB  - Energy security and climate change have cascading effects on the world’s burgeoning population in terms of food security, environment, and sustainability. Due to depletion of fossil fuels and undesirable changes of climatic conditions, increase in air and water pollution, mankind started exploring alternate and sustainable means of meeting growing energy needs. One of the options is to use renewable sources of fuel–biofuel. In this chapter the authors have reviewed and presented sustainability impact on production of biofuels. Authors further reviewed state-of-the-art gene editing technologies toward improvement of biofuel crops. The authors recommend a phased transition from first-generation biofuel, and an acceleration toward use of technology to drive adoption of second-generation biofuels. Key aspects of technology and application of resource management models will enable these crops to bridge the global energy demand before we can completely transition to a more sustainable biofuel economy. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Here, we evaluate the COVID-19 associated challenges and opportunities surrounding the water, air, agriculture and energy sectors, the four major elements to sustain life on earth with strong implications on food security and the environment. During this pandemic, significant improvements in the quality of air and water resources have been noted. The tracking of SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, in wastewater allowed wastewater-based epidemiology for this disease. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the increased use of antimicrobials for personal hygiene and environmental disinfection can have serious consequences on the environment and public health. Air pollutants and greenhouse gases have been significantly reduced except for ozone that increased due to the decline in NOx. Tackling air pollution is important due to its role in spreading and worsening the COVID-19. Similarly, this pandemic has a strong impact on crop production systems, livestock industry, food supply chain and global food security. The zoonotic nature of this disease could change human interactions with wildlife and companion animals, but clear strategies are needed to safeguard both human health and biodiversity throughout the COVID-19 recovery. Owing to the advantages of renewable energy highlighted during COVID-19, suitable investments should be dedicated to cleaner and sustainable energy infrastructure in revival plans. © 2021.

AB  - Groundwater plays a key role in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals contributing to many of them, such as ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, poverty eradication, food security, gender equality, sustainability of cities and human settlement, combating climate change and protecting terrestrial ecosystems. But, groundwater, along with water resources, is very vulnerable to population growth and climate change and groundwater stress is a present and increasing issue worldwide that needs to be addresses in the decision-making processes leading water resources management. In the context of International Cooperation, it is a priority that programs directly or indirectly dealing with groundwater address groundwater sustainable management and conservative approaches based in scientific knowledge, invest in adequate boreholes constructions with proper planning and supervision and enhance investment in preliminary research, training and implementation of participatory approaches. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - One of the most remote Arctic locations, Andryushkino village of Yukaghir and Even peoples is located on the shore of the river Alazeya in northeastern Siberia, in the Lower Kolyma Republic of Sakha-Yakutia, Russia. The community is at the nexus of large-scale Arctic social and climate change resulting from economic shifts, permafrost melt events, and high temperatures. In this study, we approach Indigenous knowledge of climate impacts to water by investigating the role of the river Alazeya, which has enabled human life to thrive, given rise to the Indigenous governance of landscapes in the past, and today serves most of the Indigenous peoples in the region for their culture, food security, and well-being. To do this, we offer an ambitious system-change analysis of the socio-ecological context of the river basin and community by exploring oral histories recorded in the community between 2005 and 2020, combining them with relevant scientific literature and weather data from Russian measurement stations to detect and point to key messages of impacts. Our results confirm that the speed and extent of climate warming have increased since 1985. The flood event of 2007 in the village has especially been seen as a major climate change-induced catastrophe. We focus on the drivers of change from local history to present. We also investigate alternatives for future development of resilience and support for the Yukaghir culture, traditional ways of life, and language. © The Arctic Institute of North America.

AB  - Energy security has evinced a prime role in shaping prospects of economic and social development with its intrinsic relationship with environmental security due to convergence of energy generation and distribution with so many factors like global governance, economic development, affordability, equitable and sustainable energy transitions, environmental protection, environmental politics, water security, air pollution, climate change, conflicts, and environment-induced migrations. Pakistan has energy requirements of more than 75 million tons of oil equivalent (MTOE) in 2019 which is experiencing exponential increase due to growing population and changing lifestyle. The country is currently relying on thermal energy and imported fossil fuels to meet energy requirements. The share of coal in primary energy has been increased in recent years. The construction and operational phase of energy projects have significant threats to environmental security due to soil erosion and compaction, chemical spills and debris disposal, air emissions, noise and wildfire. It also shapes the terrain by damaging vegetation cover, terrestrial ecosystems and wetlands. The impacts further include dislocation of species, disturbance in migratory corridors and changes in breeding areas of wildlife. These projects also affect the water quality and modify drainage patterns causing aesthetic disruption and changes. Archeologically and culturally important sites are also being disturbed on the pretext of improving socio-economic conditions. Furthermore, climate change is reshaping the nexus of energy with environmental security in Pakistan. Resultantly, there may be a paradigm shift due to energy insecurity, geopolitical conflicts in the region, consumer’s access to affordable energy, environmental injustice and insecurity. Pakistan already lacks renewable energy but inefficient use, line losses, energy-inefficient infrastructure and technologies challenge the government to meet the targets of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 7), pillar 4 (Water, energy and food security) of the Pakistan Vision 2025. Hence, Pakistan has to establish a good framework of governance for thermal power sector, upgrade its existing energy infrastructure, diversify energy recourses, introduce energy-efficient technologies, develop minimum standards for power generation, explore renewable and competitive energy market, identify low carbon power generation methods, subsidize alternative and renewable energy (ARE) technologies, balance energy mix, improve fuel efficiency, manage energy demand, invest on research and development, aware the people and regulate consumer’s behavior and practices to achieve optimum energy security and environmental security. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Current food production systems are major contributors to the environmental degradation that leads to climate change and biodiversity loss. Levels of production required for future food security cannot be met by further increases in inputs of non-renewable resources. The world’s food crops must therefore be managed in a sustainable way that maintains long-term ecological functioning, including nutrient, carbon and water cycles, soil quality, primary productivity, microbe-plant associations, pest and pathogen regulation, pollination and arable food web resilience. All of these are determined by agronomic practices at local and regional scales, and all are sustained by the abundance, diversity and functional composition of plants, microbes and invertebrates in the farmed ecosystem. Presence of viable populations and communities of these organisms is therefore essential for system resilience. Long-term sustainability must rely more heavily on the internal generation of products and regulatory ecosystem services than on external inputs. Fully closed systems are impossible to achieve in agriculture as the product is removed for human consumption. There is ample evidence, however, that semi-closed, regenerative, systems can harness the ecosystem services provided by functional biodiversity to enhance crop production whilst simultaneously improving environmental quality. Here, agroecological alternatives to intensive farming practices are reviewed, focusing on key functional indicators and whole-system integration of practical management options designed to achieve multiple beneficial outcomes at field and farm scales. © CAB International 2021.

AB  - The land provides vital resources to support life on Earth. Land ecosystems services have social, cultural, and spiritual benefits and promote human health and well-being. However, human activities, particularly ongoing unsustainable land practices, are negatively impacting ecosystems through desertification, land degradation and drought (DLDD). This article highlights the pressures and impacts of DLDD on human health through exposure pathways, including water security and safety; sanitation and hygiene; food security and safety; air quality; and soil quality. We describe the impacts on 19 health outcomes in three groups: non-communicable diseases; injuries; and infections, parasitic and nutritional diseases. The magnitude of these health impacts is mediated by social, economic, and health system-related factors. We propose actions for the health sector to respond to the DLDD challenges. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Drought-prone grasslands provide a critical resource for the millions of people who are dependent on livestock for food security. However, this ecosystem is potentially vulnerable to climate change (e.g., precipitation) and human activity (e.g., grazing). Despite this, the influences of precipitation and grazing on ecological functions of drought-prone grasslands in the Tianshan Mountains remain relatively unexplored. Therefore, we conducted a systematic field investigation and a clipping experiment (simulating different intensities of grazing) in a drought-prone grassland on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains in China to examine the influences of precipitation and grazing on aboveground biomass (AGB), soil volumetric water content (SVWC), and precipitation use efficiency (PUE) during the period of 2014–2017. We obtained the meteorological and SVWC data using an HL20 Bowen ratio system and a PR2 soil profile hydrometer, respectively. We found that AGB was clearly affected by both the amount and seasonal pattern of precipitation, and that PUE may be relatively low in years with either low or excessive precipitation. The PUE values were generally higher in the rapid growing season (April–July) than in the entire growing season (April–October). Overall, moderate grazing can promote plant growth under water stress conditions. The SVWC value was higher in the clipped plots than in the unclipped plots in the rapid growing season (April–July), but it was lower in the clipped plots than in the unclipped plots in the slow growing season (August–October). Our findings can enhance the understanding of the ecological effects of precipitation and grazing in drought-prone grasslands and provide data that will support the effective local grassland management. © 2020, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - People have depended upon land-based resources ever since the dawn of civilization. However, in recent decades, it has become evident that modern agriculture, urbanization, industries, population and resource use pressures have led to the progressive deterioration of soil quality and land productivity. There is an urgent need for a transformation in land management, agricultural practices, diets, and indeed, lifestyles to reverse the detrimental impacts of human development on our Earth. Innovative approaches including urban agriculture, vertical farming, hydroponics, aquaculture, and aquaponics will be needed to meet the growing food demands. In order to ensure that we will continue to be able to sustain the growing world population well into the future, we must adopt intensive but integrated and holistic soil and land management, i.e., regenerative practices that enhance soil organic matter, soil biological and microbial activity and plant diversity. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The greater Himalayan region, stretching from Afghanistan in the west to Myanmar in the east, is home to about a quarter of a billion people who greatly depend on available natural resources for their survival and livelihoods. The ever-increasing population pressure and changing climate have grave implications for the sustenance of human health and habitation in the foreseeable future. The region is confronted with numerous challenges related to forest degradation, land productivity, disaster risk, water management, biodiversity loss, erratic climatic patterns, as well as socio-political capacity. The limits of arable land have essentially been reached, while the need for enhancing production to sustain human nutritive requirements and livelihoods continues to increase. Hence, the intensification of agriculture has become a necessity rather than a choice. Yet, producing greater numbers of crops and quantities of food, fiber and other materials on the same parcel of land runs the risk of degrading the soil fertility, productivity and overall quality. Therefore, means to achieve this without irreversibly damaging the soil and land resource base have become imperative. To this end, agro-forestry, agro-slivi-pastoral systems, and the adoption of a variety of regenerative crops, soil and water management and conservation practices offer the potential to deliver multiple benefits without sacrificing the very resource upon which the human population depends. The need for ecologically sound and sustainable management of natural resources in the Himalayan region, as well as the adaptation of local communities to the impacts of climate change and measures for its mitigation, cannot be over-emphasized. This book presents findings on approaches to sustainable land management and the intensification of agriculture and animal husbandry related to soil organic matter management and carbon sequestration for multiple benefits; and the agroforestry as a crop diversification strategy with livelihood and climate mitigation/adaptation benefits, along with other aspects of forest, biodiversity and water resources management. The book deals with technical, socio-economic, policy and biodiversity issues related to the sustainable use and management of natural resources, namely forests, soil/land, water, crops, animal husbandry and diversity of flora/fauna, as well as disaster risk and vulnerability of communities in the Himalayan region. There is a continuing need to study and research approaches for harmonizing human needs and lifestyles with natural ecosystems and processes so that both may co-exist in a mutually beneficial manner. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The key factor for sustainable development is the integration of sensitive methods for early detection of environmental risk factors for nutritional health with efficient primary prevention against contamination of the food chains as well as deficiency of biologically active trace elements in the human diet. Proper algorithms of laser photostimulation are recommended both for more efficient biological treatment of wastewater and also for a proper amount of essential elements in cultivated plants supplemented by other modern biotechnology for multiplication e.g. vegetables. Laser biotechnology is also recommended for better reclamation followed by enhancement of biomass and bioenergy production in different regions of the world as a contribution to sustainable development and the creation of many green jobs. This eco-innovation supplemented with the complementary biotechnologies e.g. reclamation of semiarid areas, modern apiculture integrated with the cultivation of medical plants, cultivation of algae, aquaculture, energy plantations, reforestation and protection of biodiversity could contribute to better adaptation to climate change and situation connected with COVID-19 pandemic and risk of worsening human health, malnutrition, and hunger. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Since independence, India achieved a distinction from ship-to-mouth status to self dependent, food surplus and net exporter of food grains in 69 years and recorded an all time high (285.2 million tonnes) production during 2018-19 from meagre 50.8 mt during 1950-51. In spite of spectacular success in food production over the years, it is a great challenge to sustain high production as well as enhance it further to meet the future requirement, as the population continues to grow steadily with an annual growth rate of 1.10% and expected to be 1.42 billion and 1.48 billion by 2025 and 2030, respectively, from 1.32 billion during 2017; coupled with enhanced consumption of food grains due to rising income, necessitating an increase of 4.5% and 15.7% by 2020 and 2030, respectively, over the present food production. It is a great challenge in view of climate change, diminishing and degrading land and water resources, increasing biotic and abiotic stresses and loss of bio-diversity. The present paper discusses the trend of production and productivity of food crops from 1950-51 to 2018-19; assess the contribution of seed to food production, seed chain, quality seed production and scope of quality seed for enhancing farmers' income and future strategies for seed research, production and development to sustain food production. Requisite assets such as a strong crop specific cultivar development programmes, 850 high yielding food crop varieties comprising 657 of cereals and 193 of pulses released during the last six years, robust and vibrant seed systems, quality regulatory mechanism, globally competitive seed sector and the largest arable land with 46 soil types across 15 agro-climatic zones favouring seed production of diverse crops are available for sustaining high food production and meet the future demand for seed and food. Ensuring availability of quality seed in adequate quantity though imperative, yet, itself is not enough to trigger the production if it is not coupled with achieving sufficient varietal diversity in seed chain preferably phasing out gradually the old and obsolete varieties and inducting recently developed high yielding and disease resistant varieties. The overall progress and outcome are largely dependent on Government policies and support, which require consistent and adequate financial resources for sustaining a vibrant seed production, farm power machinery, processing units, storage, seed testing, delivery systems and trained human resources besides remunerative prices to the farmers. © 2020 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

AB  - Producing, processing and distributing food is the biggest thing that humans do on the planet. In aggregate terms, agriculture has been very successful in ensuring that global food production has more than kept pace with global population growth over recent decades. However, in recent years concerns have intensified about the quality, equity, sustainability and resilience of the food system. Only around one-third of all people on Earth are eating a healthy diet. The food system is the biggest user and polluter of land and water, the biggest driver of habitat and biodiversity loss, and on track to be the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus and the resultant COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the systemic risks to human health from current food production and distribution systems. How to produce more, healthier and safer food, much more efficiently and sustainably, in more difficult climates, and how to share it more equitably, is an existential challenge for humanity. Australian science, and rangeland science in particular, is well-placed to play a leadership role across the Indo-Pacific in this endeavour. The Australian innovation system in agriculture and natural resource management has long had to contend with highly variable climates and extreme weather events, to produce competitive products for global markets with minimal subsidies. The know-how, and associated policies and institutions developed in doing so, are a strategic national asset and an important element of Australian soft power in our region. © 2020 Journal Compilation

AB  - Human health and wellbeing and the health of the biosphere are inextricably linked. The state of Earth’s life-support systems, including freshwater, oceans, land, biodiversity, atmosphere, and climate, affect human health. At the same time, human activities are adversely affecting natural systems. This review paper is the outcome of an interdisciplinary workshop under the auspices of the Future Earth Health Knowledge Action Network (Health KAN). It outlines a research agenda to address cross-cutting knowledge gaps to further understanding and management of the health risks of these global environmental changes through an expert consultation and review process. The research agenda has four main themes: (1) risk identification and management (including related to water, hygiene, sanitation, and waste management); food production and consumption; oceans; and extreme weather events and climate change. (2) Strengthening climate-resilient health systems; (3) Monitoring, surveillance, and evaluation; and (4) risk communication. Research approaches need to be transdisciplinary, multi-scalar, inclusive, equitable, and broadly communicated. Promoting resilient and sustainable development are critical for achieving human and planetary health. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Coral reefs have been subject to mass coral bleaching, potentially causing rapid and widespread degradation of ecosystem services that depend on live coral cover, such as fisheries catch. Fisheries species in tropical waters associate with a wide range of habitats, so assessing the dependency of fisheries on coral reefs is important for guiding fishery responses to coral reef degradation. This study aimed to determine how fisheries catches associate with coral reefs in Queensland, Australia. Queensland’s largest fisheries did not target fish associated with reefs, but specific sectors, particularly aquarium fisheries and commercial fisheries in the mid to northern region had a high dependence on species that use coral reefs. Regions that had a greater relative area of coral reefs had higher catches of species that depend on live coral, suggesting that coral area could be used to predict the sensitivity of a jurisdiction’s fisheries to bleaching. Dynamic analysis of stock trends found that coral trout and red throat emperor, the two largest species by catch for the reef line fishery, were at risk of overfishing if habitat loss caused declines in stock productivity. Management of fisheries that are highly dependent on reefs may need to adapt to declining productivity, but further research to support ongoing reforms in Queensland’s fisheries is needed to quantitatively link reef degradation to stock production parameters is needed. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Locusts differ from ordinary grasshoppers in their ability to swarm over long distances and are among the oldest migratory pests. The ecology and biology of locusts make them among the most devastating pests worldwide and hence the calls for actions to prevent the next outbreaks. The most destructive of all locust species is the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria). Here, we review the current locust epidemic 2020 outbreak and its causes and prevention including the green technologies that may provide a reference for future directions of locust control and food security. Massive locust outbreaks threaten the terrestrial environments and crop production in around 100 countries of which Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya are the most affected. Six large locust outbreaks are reported for the period from 1912 to 1989 all being closely related to long-term droughts and warm winters coupled with occurrence of high precipitation in spring and summer. The outbreaks in East Africa, India and Pakistan are the most pronounced with locusts migrating more than 150 km/day during which the locusts consume food equivalent to their own body weight on a daily basis. The plague heavily affects the agricultural sectors, which is the foundation of national economies and social stability. Global warming is likely the main cause of locust plague outbreak in recent decades driving egg spawning of up to 2–400,000 eggs per square meter. Biological control techniques such as microorganisms, insects and birds help to reduce the outbreaks while reducing ecosystem and agricultural impacts. In addition, green technologies such as light and sound stimulation seem to work, however, these are challenging and need further technological development incorporating remote sensing and modelling before they are applicable on large-scales. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the 2020 locust outbreak is the worst in 70 years probably triggered by climate change, hurricanes and heavy rain and has affected a total of 70,000 ha in Somalia and Ethiopia. There is a need for shifting towards soybean, rape, and watermelon which seems to help to prevent locust outbreaks and obtain food security. Furthermore, locusts have a very high protein content and is an excellent protein source for meat production and as an alternative human protein source, which should be used to mitigate food security. In addition, forestation of arable land improves local climate conditions towards less precipitation and lower temperatures while simultaneously attracting a larger number of birds thereby increasing the locust predation rates. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Globally, our knowledge on lake fisheries is still limited despite their importance to food security and livelihoods. Here we show that fish catches can respond either positively or negatively to climate and land-use changes, by analyzing time-series data (1970–2014) for 31 lakes across five continents. We find that effects of a climate or land-use driver (e.g., air temperature) on lake environment could be relatively consistent in directions, but consequential changes in a lake-environmental factor (e.g., water temperature) could result in either increases or decreases in fish catch in a given lake. A subsequent correlation analysis indicates that reductions in fish catch was less likely to occur in response to potential climate and land-use changes if a lake is located in a region with greater access to clean water. This finding suggests that adequate investments for water-quality protection and water-use efficiency can provide additional benefits to lake fisheries and food security. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico on 20 September 2017 causing catastrophic devastation. Prolonged shortage of food had been a substantial challenge to the residents after Maria. Experiencing food insecurity in utero has been associated with negative health outcomes later in life. We aim to examine whether there is any alteration in the infant gut microbiome that is associated with prenatal food insecurity. Methods: We established a cohort of infants aged 2–6 months who were exposed in utero to Hurricane Maria near San Juan, Puerto Rico and examined the gut microbiota (n = 29) using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Results: Among the enrolled infants, 30% of their mothers experienced “post-Maria poor access to food” for at least 1 month during pregnancy. The relative abundance of gut Veillonella spp. is significantly decreased among infants who experienced prenatal food insecurity, compared to those who did not (adjusted p = 0.025). There is no significant difference observed by prenatal food insecurity at the microbial community level in this cohort. Conclusions: Our finding indicated that infants who experienced prenatal food insecurity post hurricane harbor microbial alternations of specific bacterial taxa, which may further influence the microbial maturation and place the individual at a high-risk health trajectory. Impact: We identified that in utero exposure to food insecurity post Hurricane Maria is associated with decreased abundance of Veillonella in the infant gut.Our findings indicated that infants who experienced prenatal food insecurity post hurricane may harbor alterations of specific bacterial taxa in their gut microbiota.This study showed the association between prenatal adverse exposure and alterations of gut microbiome early in life in the context of an extreme event.This study provided insights into the mechanisms underlying prenatal adverse exposure and increased disease risks later in life.Our findings will potentially raise awareness of the negative impact of extreme climate events on the unborn. © 2020, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Most of the initiatives to adapt, reduce and mitigate the effects of global challenges of our planet are currently dominated by the consequences of climate change. These are unintentionally overshadowing others such as food security, increase of human population, preservation of natural ecosystems, water scarcity and reliability of energy supply, amongst others. This fact tends to obscure the reality that most, if not all the global challenges, are closely interdependent and need a holistic approach to deal with them in a coherent and effective way. Likewise, society at large must be made fully aware that there will not be an enduring solution unless there is a change in the level of consumption of goods and energy in affluent countries. There is an increasing perception, understanding and concern in academic circles as well as in other sectors of society that the unsustainable production and consumption of natural resources need to be tackled by novel approaches. These combined efforts should ensure that they will be enacted in policy initiatives and in the actions that pave the way to building a global biodiplomacy. This new biodiplomacy should have the courage to develop and act in the interests of the human population overall, and not be undone by the legitimate but narrower interests of any single national priority. This article concludes by highlighting some of the key elements needed to give a biodiplomacy a chance to address, effectively, responsibly and synergistically, the current global challenges that affect mankind. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Delta and estuary cities are facing the immense challenges of adaptation and mitigation to climate change. The very creation and evolution of human civilizations depended on living along shorelines, serving as the source of food, water, and security. However, fear of water is just as deeply grained and cross-cultural as love of water. The unpredictable river and ocean landscapes have been domesticated along history with a special impact on ecosystems since the industrial era. Newcastle's waterfront, including the Hunter river estuary and the ocean shoreline are unique landscapes, which have been strongly modified due to land reclamation leading to the destruction of such a vulnerable ecosystem. As a consequence, city resilience is under threat due to the effects of unpredictable events, dynamics, forces of climate change, amplified without the natural protection of these water ecosystems. The methodology to present this research includes two primary steps. The first step was the creation of a data and map database to study the historic and current conditions, combined with future predictions, on urban, environmental, and flooding conditions in the Newcastle waterfront areas. All predictions are to identify and catalogue the worst scenarios in the event of a dramatic climate change evolution. The second step, which is still under development and contingent on funding, is the compilation of urban and architectonic adaptative strategies and evidence-based design guidelines that can be implemented and integrated with other environmental, urban and social sustainable strategies. The ultimate result will be a data and map catalogue linked with a set of design principles, strategies, and guidelines aligned with sustainable and achievable goals, to ensure coastal and riverbank adaptation and mitigation. The strategies will not only improve resilience, reduce vulnerability and risk, but enhance liveability in urbanised delta throughout an interdisciplinary approach, and also to ensure a more sustainable future. The problem of dynamic forces acting in estuary cities and its conflict with human habitation needs to be faced in an interdisciplinary manner, integrating different perspectives and approaches that consider current capacities, past events, and future predictions. The results of this project aim to meet those goals and is one step to help achieve a sustainable future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Regions affected by resource scarcity, poverty, and land-use conflicts need to advocate the merits of practices strongly grounded in sustainable land management. This review paper provides an analysis of agroforestry as an integrated system embedded in complex relations between resource uses in the Water–Energy–Land–Food (WELF) nexus. Using the African Sahel region as a case study, the paper explains the need for understanding land management practices, such as agroforestry, through the lens of trade-offs and benefits inherent in the WELF nexus. Agroforestry practices are demonstrated to be valuable interventions leading to i) resilience to climate stresses, ii) water, energy, and food securities, iii) mitigation of resource-oriented harbingers of conflicts and iv) development opportunities. These goals can also yield valuable results in terms of promoting sustainable development, i.e. functional ecosystems, livelihoods, and human security. Two overarching sub-nexuses, namely agroforestry–food–energy and agroforestry–food–water–climate, are identified in the Sahelian context and conceptualized. Primarily, the trade-offs outlined within these sub-nexuses are fuelwood vs. crops, use of land for more forests vs. more cropping, and water availability for agroforestry vs. agroforestry impacts on the water cycle. Despite the positive outcomes and opportunities, agroforestry systems in the Sahel still face some challenges such as vague land use rights, inadequate capacities and lack of investments. Policy recommendations are synthesized at three levels. This synthesis involves remedies to lessen pressures at the interlinks of WELF resource use, overarching remedies in the two sub-nexuses, and remedies across all the sectors and issues for improving agroforestry outcomes. Optimal remedies stress the importance of choosing the right land, water and plant combinations as well as incorporating efficiency measures and alternative sources. A successful agroforestry system is characterized by a conducive environment at the farm level in terms of institutions, management, enhancing the farmer's capacity, and good infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: This project was taken up for a period of two years to assess the nutritional capacity of Channa striata, which is consumed as a cheap, nutritious food in most parts of India and East Asian countries by determining its fatty acid profile and monthly variation of lipid and fatty acid in its most edible part. Methods: Total lipid was extracted by conventional methods laid down by Folch and his associates and was then saponified to obtain the total fatty acid. The fatty acid mixture thus obtained was then converted to their methyl esters and was subjected to Gas Chromatograph using a flame ionization detector to detect the individual fatty acids. Results: Our investigation shows that the total lipid and fatty acid in the edible part dip to its minimum in the month of July, as one should expect during the breeding season because the stored lipid, as well as fatty acids, are mobilized to the gonads for their development during the reproductive season which is monsoon. C. striata contain more of MUFAs (64.34%) and PUFAs (16.21%), which are more beneficial to human health than SFAs (12.5%), which are most hazardous to health. Conclusion: C. striata can definitely be marked as a cheap, nutritious food source, with its share of negativity. Our work will surely enlighten future works on this species in the spheres of preservation, organized farming, and maintaining the biodiversity of the place where it thrives. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Long-term land use/land cover (LULC) assessments, based on remote-sensing data, play a leading role in gathering information on land degradation that has an impact on food security, soil quality and species habitats with all the accompanying social implications. The aim of this study was to determine the LULC changes of severely degraded land using high-resolution remote-sensing data from the last ~50 years in order to determine whether human activities have led to improvements or further land degradation. An area of 70 km2 near Cherrapunji in Northeast India, which receives 11,000 mm of rainfall annually and was deforested in historical times, was selected for this analysis. Despite severe land degradation, the population density of this area has been continuously increasing, standing at ~300 inhabitants km−2 in 2011. A visual interpretation technique, combined with field surveys, was used for LULC mapping, based on satellite images from the US Corona programme for 1965, pansharpened Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) images IRS-1D for 1998 and Google Earth for 2017. This analysis indicated the dominance of grassland (73.2%), with a small contribution of forest (17.6%), settlements (5.8%), mining (2.3%), cropland (0.7%) and water bodies (0.4%) in 2017. The LULC structure was the result of a largely degraded land contribution inherited from the past and the emergence of new driving forces behind land-use change. The LULC trends in 1965–2017 included a decrease of forest (4%) and grassland (5%), stability of cropland, and an increase of land-use classes which, in non-degraded land under a monsoonal climate, are usually of small extension, such as settlements (85%), mining (132%) and water bodies (525%). These changes reflect both, attempts to utilise existing environmental resources and to adapt to living in a degraded environment caused by growing human population. From the land degradation perspective, the trends in LULC change show two opposing directions––further land degradation mainly associated with the expansion of settlements and mining (accounting for ~79% of the total LULC changes), and land improvement and neutral change, including the recovery of natural vegetation and the construction of water bodies. The relationships between the LULC changes and direct measurements of biomass and carbon stocks of forest and grassland ecosystems indicated that their balance was negative for the Cherrapunji spur in 1965–2017. A strategy aimed at restoring the sustainability of the Cherrapunji spur environment should focus on the replacement of grassland by forest through the abandonment of uncontrolled grass burning, animal grazing and coal mining with the simultaneous provision of alternative gainful employment for the local population such as tourism and aquaculture. © 2020

AB  - Climate change is dramatically restructuring agriculture and damaging crops, food security, and human health, especially in deserts. To radically redesign food systems to buffer against climatic disruptions, we focus on agroecological function, human health, and community well-being. Using arid North America (“Aridamerica”) as a laboratory for the future, we employed 18 criteria to select 17 desert plant genera with high potential as food crops. When integrated into perennial polycultures modeled after arid ecosystems and traditional knowledge, desert plants can stabilize yields, produce disease-preventing foods, and generate rural livelihoods. We envision food systems that can reduce disparities while enhancing resilience in a hotter, drier world. Summary: Climate disruptions and water scarcity are threatening food security and human well-being. We provide a framework for selecting a more diverse set of arid-adapted food crops to reduce food system vulnerabilities to climate change, climate-related illness, and economic disparities in arid lands. We constructed a list of candidate crops based on the diets of the Comcaac, O'odham, and Pima Bajo peoples of the Sonoran Desert. Representative genera were then screened for traits related to agroecological functionality, human health, community well-being, and agronomic suitability. Of the 154 species (86 genera) used by these Sonoran Desert Indigenous cultures, 101 species (80 genera) were more broadly used in Aridamerica, suggesting wide acceptability and value of desert plants for arid-adapted agriculture in North America. We highlight 17 genera with high potential to simultaneously improve agricultural resilience, human health, and community prosperity in the face of climate change, over a third of which are water-use efficient crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) succulents. Assembling these candidate crops into perennial polycultures coupled with solar energy and rainwater harvesting systems can maximize yield reliability while minimizing fossil fuel, agrichemical, and surface and groundwater use. Now is the time to invest in desert-adapted farming and food systems, with climate change already accelerating damages to agricultural landscapes. Biomimicry and traditional knowledge can aid in designing co-located food, water, and energy provisioning systems adapted to arid climates and scarce resources that improve agroecological and human health. Adopting such designs will require transdisciplinary integration of plant, environmental, social, and health sciences. © 2020 The Authors, Plants, People, Planet © New Phytologist Trust

AB  - Nature provides significant benefits to people, especially those living in and around protected areas. Ecosystem services from protected areas include producing wild food, supporting biodiversity and water cycles, regulating climate, and providing cultural services like better health, tourism, and legacy for future generations. In economic terms, the flows of ecosystem services provided by protected areas are worth hundreds of billions of dollars each year, well justifying the costs of managing these sites, but protected areas are suffering from environmental problems such as impacts from human population growth, rural poverty, growing demands for natural resources, land use change that degrades ecosystem productivity, invasive non-native species that harm natural ecosystems, and climate change that is affecting all ecosystems. Addressing these linked challenges will require mobilizing all parts of the economy, including the protected area estate. For example, protected areas can take a leadership role in rural development, expand the conservation estate to half of the planet through connectivity and improved management of more of the non-agricultural land, enhance the prominent role of protected areas in contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, encourage productive research on applying modern technology to protected areas management, seek broader private sector participation in conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services, and include protected areas as relevant parties in relevant trade and other international negotiations. When protected area managers embrace this broader role, they will find enthusiastic public support for this contribution to a sustainable human society. © 2020 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - The sustainability of grazing lands lies in the nexus of human consumption behavior, livestock productivity, and environmental footprint. Due to fast growing global food demands, many grazing lands have suffered from overgrazing, leading to soil degradation, air and water pollution, and biodiversity losses. Multidisciplinary efforts are required to understand how these lands can be better assessed and managed to attain predictable outcomes of optimal benefit to society. This paper synthesizes our understanding based on previous work done on modelling the influences of grazing of soil carbon (SC) and greenhouse gas emissions to identify current knowledge gaps and research priorities. We revisit three widely-used process-based models: DeNitrification DeComposition (DNDC), DayCent, and the Pasture Simulation model (PaSim) and two watershed models: The Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Variable Infiltration Capacity Model (VIC), which are widely used to simulate C, nutrient and water cycles. We review their structures and ability as process-based models in representing key feedbacks among grazing management, SOM decomposition and hydrological processes in grazing lands. Then we review some significant advances in the use of models combining biogeochemical and hydrological processes. Finally, we examine challenges of incorporating spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability into modelling C and nutrient cycling in grazing lands and discuss their weakness and strengths. We also highlight key research direction for improving the knowledge base and code structure in modelling C and nutrient cycling in grazing lands, which are essential to conserve grazing lands and maintain their ecosystem goods and services. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Small islands are vulnerable to climate change, and at the same time contribute to local and global environmental problems with the intensification of tourist activities. Whereas there are many studies on the resource requirements or environmental impacts of small islands, there are few efforts to integrate information that is often analysed separately. Metabolic analysis, beyond quantifying biophysical flows, studies how society transforms these flows to reproduce the identity of the whole. This study applies the Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) approach, to analyse the environmental and economic performance of different economic activities in the Mediterranean island of Menorca (Spain). The openness of the metabolic system (observed in the dependence on imports) and externalization of environmental impact are illustrated using the examples of the cheese and tourist industry. The results show that a higher economic performance in terms of value added is associated with activities in industry and services with a larger dependence on imports of “external resources” – fuel for transportation, milk for cheese, seasonal workers and “paying capacity” of tourists. This dependence reduces local environmental pressures and also adaptation capacity, since decisions made in Menorca may have limited impact elsewhere. Local agriculture depends less on external resources but it is limited by the low economic productivity of land and labour. An integrated analysis of the relations between metabolic rates and densities of flows in the different compartments of the society provides a holistic picture of sustainability issues and can contribute to decision-making by avoiding partial information. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There is wide scale concern about the effects of red meat on human health and climate change. Plant-based meat alternatives, designed to mimic the sensory experience and nutritional value of red meat, have recently been introduced into consumer markets. Plant-based meats are marketed under the premise of environmental and human health benefits and are aimed appeal to a broad consumer base. Meat production is critiqued for its overuse of water supplies, landscape degradation, and greenhouse gas emission, and depending on production practices, environmental footprints may be lower with plant-based meat alternatives. Life-cycle analyses suggest that the novel plant-based meat alternatives have an environmental footprint that may be lower than beef finished in feedlots, but higher than beef raised on well-managed pastures. In this review, we discuss the nutritional and ecological impacts of eating plant-based meat alternatives vs. animal meats. Most humans fall on a spectrum of omnivory: they satisfy some nutrient requirements better from plant foods, while needs for other nutrients are met more readily from animal foods. Animal foods also facilitate the uptake of several plant-derived nutrients (zinc and iron), while plant nutrients can offer protection against potentially harmful compounds in cooked meat. Thus, plant and animal foods operate in symbiotic ways to improve human health. The mimicking of animal foods using isolated plant proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals likely underestimates the true nutritional complexity of whole foods in their natural state, which contain hundreds to thousands of nutrients that impact human health. Novel plant-based meat alternatives should arguably be treated as meat alternatives in terms of sensory experience, but not as true meat replacements in terms of nutrition. If consumers wish to replace some of their meat with plant-based alternatives in the diet (a “flexitarian approach”) this is unlikely to negatively impact their overall nutrient status, but this also depends on what other foods are in their diet and the life stage of the individual. © Copyright © 2020 van Vliet, Kronberg and Provenza.

AB  - The importance of forests to safeguard agricultural production through regulating ecosystem services such as clean water, soil protection, and climate regulation is well documented, yet the contributions of forests and trees to provide food for the nutritional needs of the increasing human population has not been fully realized. Plants, fungi, and animals harvested from forests have long provided multiple benefits—for nutrition, health, income, and cultural purposes. Across the globe, the main element of “forest management” has been industrial wood production. Sourcing food from forests has been not even an afterthought but a subordinate activity that just happens and is largely invisible in official statistics. For many people, forests ensure a secure supply of essential foods and vital nutrients. For others, foraging forests for food offers cultural, recreational, and diversified culinary benefits. Increasingly, these products are perceived by consumers as being more “natural” and healthier than food from agricultural production. Forest-and wild-sourced products increasingly are being used as key ingredients in multiple billion dollar industries due to rising demand for “natural” food production. Consumer trends demonstrate growing interests in forest food gathering that involves biological processes and new forms of culturally embedded interactions with the natural world. Further, intensifying calls to “re-orient” agricultural production provides opportunities to expand the roles of forests in food production; to reset food systems by integrating forests and trees. We use examples of various plants, such as baobab, to explore ways forests and trees provide for food security and nutrition and illustrate elements of a framework to encourage integration of forests and trees. Forests and trees provide innovative opportunities and technological and logistical challenges to expand food systems and transition to a bioeconomy. This shift is essential to meet the expanding demand for secure and nutritious food, while conserving forest biodiversity. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Climate change will impact every aspect of biophysical systems and society. However, unlike other components of the climate system, the impact of climate change on the groundwater system has only recently received attention. This focus is due to the realization that groundwater is a vital freshwater resource crucial to global food and water security, and is essential in sustaining ecosystems and human adaptation to climate variability and change. This paper synthesizes findings on the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the entire groundwater system and each component. Also, we appraise the use of coupled groundwater-climate and land surface models in groundwater hydrology as a means of improving existing knowledge of climate change-groundwater interaction, finding that most models anticipate decreases in groundwater recharge, storage and levels, particularly in the arid/semi-arid tropics. Reducing uncertainties in future climate projections and improving our understanding of the physical processes underlying models to improve their simulation of real-world conditions remain a priority for climate and Earth scientists. Despite the enormous progress made, there are still few and inadequate local and regional aquifer studies, especially in less developed regions. The paper proposes two key considerations. First, physical basis: the need for a deeper grasp of complex physical processes and feedback mechanism with the use of more sophisticated models. Second, the need to understand the socioeconomic dimensions of climate-groundwater interaction through multidisciplinary synergy, leading to the development of better groundwater-climate change adaptation strategies and modeling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The lack of natural resources, especially good-quality cropland and renewable water resources is threatening food production potential in marginal agricultural ecosystems, which are already negatively affected by climate change. Since the world's major crops are proving inadequate to supply the calories and nutrients for people in these areas, new crops are sought that can withstand harsh ecological environmental conditions. In the current trial, we assessed the growth and productivity of Tetragonia tetragonioides (Pallas) Kuntz. in a floating hydroponic system supplied with different seawater proportions (i.e. 15% and 30% seawater, EC = 9.8 and 18.0 dS m−1). Moreover, the effects of different salinity levels on mineral elements accumulation, production of osmotic solutes and secondary metabolites were determined, along with the salt removal capacity of the crop. The results indicated that plant growth was not affected by either of the seawater treatments used in this study. The increased leaf succulence and the reduction of both leaf area and specific leaf area with increasing salinity might represent an essential feature of this salt-tolerant species associated to the plants need of limiting transpiration. Low seawater treated plants showed a significantly higher biomass yield per liter of (sea)water used (117%) than the control. Under these conditions plants accumulated the highest amount of Mg (+31% and 48% in medium and high seawater treated plants compared with the control) and Cu (+14% and 30%, respectively) along with increasing proline and decreasing nitrate concentrations. By contrast, we found that seawater supply resulted in a Na-enriched leaf biomass that may represent an issue for human health. We concluded that Tetragonia tetragonioides can be grown in saline agriculture up to a salinity level characterized by an EC of 18 dS m-1 but further investigation is required to address Na accumulation in leaves. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Journal of Crop Improvement: (JCI) began its journey in 1997. It has been publishing papers related to sustainability of agriculture in one form or another ever since. Sustainable agricultural systems involve the use of farming practices that protect the environment, public health and human communities. They also ensure animal welfare, protect biodiversity and promote healthy ecosystems. Agricultural scientists recognize that one of the best ways of alleviating the twin scourges of poverty and hunger is through agriculture, i.e., by increasing food production. JCI published a special issue on ‘Agricultural and Environmental Sustainability’ in 2007. In 2009–2010, several articles were published, which specifically addressed important water and agricultural sustainability strategies. In 2013–2014, numerous articles on combating climate change from the standpoint of agriculture were published. The issues at the core of JCI have also been enshrined in the United Nations’ ‘Sustainable Development Goals’ (SDGs), which were established in 2015. In this article, I have highlighted and documented how what we publish in JCI relate to most of the 17 SDGs. The predominant goal of all agricultural enterprise is human welfare, which is also true of the SDGs. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Nestled in the fragile Himalayan ecosystem, the state of Jammu and Kashmir holds a significant importance in terms of species richness, ecological wealth, water resources and socio-cultural diversity. When the climate change indicators are very visible in the region, many-sided concerns upshot thereby, especially encircling the species composition change, biodiversity loss, frequent environmental stresses, food security, landslides, snowstorms, agro-biodiversity, livelihood and human health. Other than the general footprints, climate change negatively impacts the overall performance of the plants either directly or indirectly by changing the intensity and frequency of abiotic stress factors. As diverse plant species growing in higher altitudes of the region are open to very unfavourable and harsh conditions, especially low temperature, these provide insights into different adaptive mechanisms for abiotic stress tolerance and can be dissected for the same. From time to time, efforts have been made to develop stress resilient crops or climate smart agriculture. A holistic approach comprising the fields of agricultural biotechnology, socio-cultural integrity and crop ecology is going to provide an excellent insight into climate change mitigation strategies and plant abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms in the delicate ecosystem. Moreover, to finely strategize the conservation laws and policies and also for bio prospecting activities, a comprehensive knowledge on abiotic stresses associated with climate change and the counter responses of Himalayan flora is critical. © 2020 Indian National Science Academy.

AB  - Interlocked challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation require transformative interventions in the land management and food production sectors to reduce carbon emissions, strengthen adaptive capacity, and increase food security. However, deciding which interventions to pursue and understanding their relative co-benefits with and trade-offs against different social and environmental goals have been difficult without comparisons across a range of possible actions. This study examined 40 different options, implemented through land management, value chains, or risk management, for their relative impacts across 18 Nature's Contributions to People (NCPs) and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We find that a relatively small number of interventions show positive synergies with both SDGs and NCPs with no significant adverse trade-offs; these include improved cropland management, improved grazing land management, improved livestock management, agroforestry, integrated water management, increased soil organic carbon content, reduced soil erosion, salinization, and compaction, fire management, reduced landslides and hazards, reduced pollution, reduced post-harvest losses, improved energy use in food systems, and disaster risk management. Several interventions show potentially significant negative impacts on both SDGs and NCPs; these include bioenergy and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, afforestation, and some risk sharing measures, like commercial crop insurance. Our results demonstrate that a better understanding of co-benefits and trade-offs of different policy approaches can help decision-makers choose the more effective, or at the very minimum, more benign interventions for implementation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Various environmental challenges are rapidly threatening ecosystems and societies globally. Major interventions and a strategic approach are required to minimize harm and to avoid reaching catastrophic tipping points. Setting evidence-based priorities aids maximizing the impact of the limited resources available for environmental interventions. Focusing on protecting both food security and biodiversity, international experts prioritized major environmental challenges for intervention based on three comprehensive criteria – importance, neglect, and tractability. The top priorities differ between food security and biodiversity. For food security, the top priorities are pollinator loss, soil compaction, and nutrient depletion, and for biodiversity conservation, ocean acidification and land and sea use (especially habitat degradation) are the main concerns. While climate change might be the most pressing environmental challenge and mitigation is clearly off-track, other issues rank higher because of climate change's high attention in research. Research and policy agendas do not yet consistently cover these priorities. Thus, a shift in attention towards the high-priority environmental challenges, identified here, is needed to increase the effectiveness of global environmental protection. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Humans have substantially altered soil and landscape patterns and properties due to agricultural use, with severe Impacts on biodiversity, carbon sequestration and food security. These Impacts are difficult to quantify, because we lack data on long-term changes In soils In natural and agricultural settings and available simulation methods are not suitable for reliably predicting future development of soils under projected changes In climate and land management. To help overcome these challenges, we developed the HydroLorica soil-landscape evolution model that simulates soil development by explicitly modeling the spatial water balance as a driver of soil- and landscape-forming processes. We simulated 14 500 years of soil formation under natural conditions for three scenarios of different rainfall Inputs. For each scenario we added a 500-year period of Intensive agricultural land use, where we Introduced tillage erosion and changed vegetation type.</p> <p>Our results show substantial differences between natural soil patterns under different rainfall Input. With higher rainfall, soil patterns become more heterogeneous due to Increased tree throw and water erosion. Agricultural patterns differ substantially from the natural patterns, with higher variation of soil properties over larger distances and larger correlations with terrain position. In the natural system, rainfall Is the dominant factor Influencing soil variation, while for agricultural soil patterns landform explains most of the variation simulated. The cultivation of soils thus changed the dominant factors and processes Influencing soil formation and thereby also Increased predictability of soil patterns. Our study highlights the potential of soil-landscape evolution modeling for simulating past and future developments of soil and landscape patterns. Our results confirm that humans have become the dominant soil-forming factor In agricultural landscapes. © Author(s) 2020. This work Is distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

AB  - Snow plays a fundamental role in global water resources, climate, and biogeochemical processes; however, no global snow drought assessments currently exist. Changes in the duration and intensity of droughts can significantly impact ecosystems, food and water security, agriculture, hydropower, and the socioeconomics of a region. We characterize the duration and intensity of snow droughts (snow water equivalent deficits) worldwide and differences in their distributions over 1980 to 2018. We find that snow droughts became more prevalent, intensified, and lengthened across the western United States (WUS). Eastern Russia, Europe, and the WUS emerged as hot spots for snow droughts, experiencing ∼2, 16, and 28% longer snow drought durations, respectively, in the latter half of 1980 to 2018. In this second half of the record, these regions exhibited a higher probability (relative to the first half of the record) of having a snow drought exceed the average intensity from the first period by 3, 4, and 15%. The Hindu Kush and Central Asia, extratropical Andes, greater Himalayas, and Patagonia, however, experienced decreases (percent changes) in the average snow drought duration (−4, −7, −8, and −16%, respectively). Although we do not attempt to separate natural and human influences with a detailed attribution analysis, we discuss some relevant physical processes (e.g., Arctic amplification and polar vortex movement) that likely contribute to observed changes in snow drought characteristics. We also demonstrate how our framework can facilitate drought monitoring and assessment by examining two snow deficits that posed large socioeconomic challenges in the WUS (2014/2015) and Afghanistan (2017/2018). © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - We urgently need to put the concept of resilience into practice if we are to prepare our communities for climate change and exacerbated natural hazards. Yet, despite the extensive discussion surrounding community resilience, operationalizing the concept remains challenging. The dominant approaches for assessing resilience focus on either evaluating community characteristics or infrastructure functionality. While both remain useful, they have several limitations to their ability to provide actionable insight. More importantly, the current conceptualizations do not consider essential services or how access is impaired by hazards. We argue that people need access to services such as food, education, health care, and cultural amenities, in addition to water, power, sanitation, and communications, to get back some semblance of normal life. Providing equitable access to these types of services and quickly restoring that access following a disruption are paramount to community resilience. We propose a new conceptualization of community resilience that is based on access to essential services. This reframing of resilience facilitates a new measure of resilience that is spatially explicit and operational. Using two illustrative examples from the impacts of Hurricanes Florence and Michael, we demonstrate how decisionmakers and planners can use this framework to visualize the effect of a hazard and quantify resilience-enhancing interventions. This “equitable access to essentials” approach to community resilience integrates with spatial planning, and will enable communities not only to “bounce back” from a disruption, but to “bound forward” and improve the resilience and quality of life for all residents. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis

AB  - A large portion of the earth’s surface consists of arid, semi-arid and hyper-arid lands. Life in these regions is profoundly challenged by harsh environmental conditions of water limitation, high levels of solar radiation and temperature fluctuations, along with soil salinity and nutrient deficiency, which have serious consequences on plant growth and survival. In recent years, plants that grow in such extreme environments and their naturally associated beneficial microbes have attracted increased interest. The rhizosphere, rhizosheath, endosphere, and phyllosphere of desert plants display a perfect niche for isolating novel microbes. They are well adapted to extreme environments and offer an unexploited reservoir for bio-fertilizers and bio-control agents against a wide range of abiotic and biotic stresses that endanger diverse agricultural ecosystems. Their properties can be used to improve soil fertility, increase plant tolerance to various environmental stresses and crop productivity as well as benefit human health and provide enough food for a growing human population in an environment-friendly manner. Several initiatives were launched to discover the possibility of using beneficial microbes. In this review, we will be describing the efforts to explore the bacterial diversity associated with desert plants in the arid, semi-arid, and hyper-arid regions, highlighting the latest discoveries and applications of plant growth promoting bacteria from the most studied deserts around the world. © Copyright © 2020 Alsharif, Saad and Hirt.

AB  - River impoundments strongly modify the global water cycle and terrestrial water storage (TWS) variability. Given the susceptibility of global water cycle to climate change and anthropogenic influence, the synthesis of science with sustainable reservoir operation strategy is required as part of an integrated approach to water management. Here, we take advantage of new approaches combining state-of-the-art computational models and a novel satellite-based reservoir operation scheme to spatially and temporally decompose Lake Victoria's TWS, which has been dam-controlled since 1954. A ground-based lake bathymetry is merged with a global satellite-based topography to accurately represent absolute water storage, and radar altimetry data is integrated in the hydrodynamic model as a proxy of reservoir operation practices. Compared against an idealized naturalized system (i.e., no anthropogenic impacts) over 2003–2019, reservoir operation shows a significant impact on water elevation, extent, storage and outflow, controlling lake dynamics and TWS. For example, compared to Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, reservoir operation improved correlation and root mean square error of basin-wide TWS simulations by 80% and 54%, respectively. Results also show that lake water storage is 20% higher under dam control and basin-wide surface water storage contributes 64% of TWS variability. As opposed to existing reservoir operation schemes for large-scale models, the proposed model simulates spatially distributed surface water processes and does not require human water demand estimates. Our proposed approaches and findings contribute to the understanding of Lake Victoria's water dynamics and can be further applied to quantify anthropogenic impacts on the global water cycle. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The ecological communities supported by freshwater habitats and wetlands that persist from floodplain inundation generate numerous cultural, recreational and economic values via commercial fisheries and other human uses of these habitats. However, the alteration of flow connectivity, degradation, and disruption of physical processes that sustain different levels of organisms (e.g., primary producers) are threats that affect aquatic biodiversity and the productivity of these habitats. Therefore, the large scale assessment of freshwater habitats for proactive water resources planning and the development of climate change mitigation and resource management strategies is essential. However, such monitoring and assessment is complicated by the inaccessibility of many large wetland systems during times of inundation, making in situ sampling unfeasible at a time when high levels of aquatic primary producers are generating food and energy sources for higher order consumers. To understand the physical dynamics of aquatic primary producers and freshwater habitats (1991–2019) during such times in a large floodplain river in northern Australia (Gilbert catchment), this study integrated Landsat-derived modified normalised difference water index and normalised difference vegetation index in a classification tree model. Thereafter, key hydrological drivers (rainfall and river discharge) of floodplain productivity and connectivity were assessed using a range of multivariate techniques. Results show that the floodplain had a high aquatic plant biomass during the summer wet season based on the correlation between aquatic biomass accumulation (hot spots) and inundation (r=0.83 @ phase lag < 1 month) during such period. River discharge (r=0.68 @ lag = 1 month) at downstream Gilbert catchment appear to be a relatively stronger indicator of hot spots of floodplain biomass accumulation as opposed to local rainfall (r=0.57 @ lag = 3 months). While the downstream discharge explains a significant proportion of variability in the leading orthogonal mode of rainfall (r=0.83), statistical relationships developed between discharge/rainfall and the distribution of aquatic primary producers confirm that both rivers (flow) and local rainfall are key optimal predictors of inundation and sites of primary producers with river flows being a better indicator of the latter. It is therefore argued that hydro-meteorological fluctuations will be key constraints on freshwater habitats and the growth of primary producers, albeit, human disturbance of flow can impact on floodplain productivity. As illustrated in this study, such constraints are reflected in the spatial patterns and changing characteristics (connectivity and spatial heterogeneity) of hot spots of primary producers and freshwater habitats (Palustrine, Lacustrine, and Riverine ecosystems). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agriculture in India is facing several challenges which together are manifested into the sustainability issues. The broad contours of the agricultural production system in the country have been defined by the need to achieve food security which calls for close attention to rice-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system of the Indo- Gangetic Plains (IGP) whose sustainability is under threat. Degradation of natural resources, severe biotic and abiotic stresses specially drought, floods, pest infestations with accompanying impacts on biodiversity and agricultural productivity are the major constraints to agricultural development. Further, climate change has gained significant global attention over the past decade due to concerns of deleterious long-term impacts on agriculture, water supply, human welfare, regional and political stability. All the related issues need to be addressed on priority, with particular emphasis on soil-carbon through a holistic approach. As the strategy brings focus on income of farmers, the agricultural technology needs to move from “Production oriented-Green Revolution” to “Farmer’s Income oriented- Revolution” and environmentally sustainable farming. Therefore, for long-term sustainability in agriculture, 4 pillars/ components (good agricultural practices, climate-change mitigation and adaptation, diversification of highvalue crops and biodiversity management) needs to be addressed properly, more importantly good agricultural practices (GAP). The GAPs are based on the principles of risk prevention, risk analysis, sustainable agriculture, and integrated crop management (ICM), which are of utmost importance in present time. The GAPs for agricultural sustainability are reduced tillage, conservation agriculture, resource-conservation technologies (RCTs), erosioncontrol measures, diversified cropping system, micro-irrigation, balanced fertilization, manuring, watershed management, organic farming, and integrated farming systems etc. Now that the vision is to impart income security to the farmers of the country, diversification of the system across all the sub-sectors of agriculture assumes importance which is, indeed a de-risking mechanism capable of negotiating both endogenous and exogenous risks associated with the system. The effective and efficient management of agro-biodiversity is also essential through management of genebanks, science-led innovations; livelihood, food and nutrition security though crop diversification, use of lesser-known crops and wild relatives in crop improvement; dealing appropriately with quarantine, biosafety and bio-security. © 2020, Indian Society of Agronomy.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the component of the hydrological cycle that accounts for most water consumption across the agricultural region of the Heihe River basin in Northwest China. It is of great practical importance in the basin to allocate water resources for ensuring the security of food production, and to formulate effective science-based agro-ecological management policies to address climate change impacts due to the probable effects of future changing environment on regional ET. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model were first driven by the downscaled climate data from three IPCC representative concentration pathways (RCPs) that have been projected by five General circulation models (GCMs) in the Coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) and the water-saving irrigation scenario to project ET per unit area, we then added to the model the upper and lower limits of the appropriate agricultural scale that considered the ecological health to simulate the behaviour of total ET for the period 2021–2050. Finally 12 case study scenarios were used to separate the effects of climate change and human activity on total ET. The results showed that total ET can be significantly decreased by &gt;1.22 × 108 m3 when the RCP-water-saving irrigation scenarios were combined with the appropriate agricultural scale. The results suggest that the best set of strategies to reduce agricultural water consumption is to reduce the area of arable land through consideration of ecosystem health and aggressively utilize water-saving agricultural technology to counter the increased ET brought about by future climate change in the Heihe agricultural region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The structure of microbial communities, microalgae, heterotrophic protozoa and fungi contributes to characterize food webs and productivity and, from an anthropogenic point of view, the qualitative characteristics of water bodies. Traditionally, in freshwater environments many investigations have been directed to the study of pelagic microalgae (“phytoplankton”) and periphyton (i.e., photosynthetic and mixotrophic protists) through the use of light microscopy (LM). While the number of studies on bacterioplankton communities have shown a substantial increase after the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches, the study of the composition, structure, and spatio-temporal patterns of microbial eukaryotes in freshwater environments was much less widespread. Moreover, the understanding of the correspondence between the relative phytoplankton abundances estimated by HTS and LM is still incomplete. Taking into account these limitations, this study examined the biodiversity and seasonality of the community of eukaryotic microplankton in the epilimnetic layer of a large and deep perialpine lake (Lake Garda) using HTS. The analyses were carried out at monthly frequency during 2014 and 2015. The results highlighted the existence of a rich and well diversified community and the presence of numerous phytoplankton taxa that were never identified by LM in previous investigations. Furthermore, the relative abundances of phytoplankton estimated by HTS and LM showed a significant relationship at different taxonomic ranks. In the 2 years of investigation, the temporal development of the whole micro-eukaryotic community showed a clear non-random and comparable distribution pattern, with the main taxonomic groups coherently distributed in the individual seasons. In perspective, the results obtained in this study highlight the importance of HTS approaches in assessing biodiversity and the relative importance of the main protist groups along environmental gradients, including those caused by anthropogenic impacts (e.g., eutrophication and climate change). © Copyright © 2020 Salmaso, Boscaini and Pindo.

AB  - Streamflow alteration and subsequent change in long-term average, seasonality, and extremes (e.g., floods and droughts) may affect water security, which is a major concern in many watersheds across the globe. Both climatic and anthropogenic activities may contribute to such changes. Therefore, this study assesses: (i) Streamflow and precipitation trends to identify streamflow alterations in the Extended East Rapti (EER) watershed in central-southern Nepal; (ii) relationship of the alterations to climatic and anthropogenic sources; and (iii) implications of streamflow changes to the socio-environmental system. The trends in streamflow were analyzed for pre-and post-1990 periods considering the abrupt shift in temperature trend in 1990. Results showed a general decreasing trends in discharge post-1990 in the EER watershed. Human activities have significantly contributed in altering streamflow in the EER. Human-induced streamflow alterations have affected the water availability, food security, river health, aquatic biodiversity, and groundwater abstraction in the EER watershed. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Climate change is not a myth anymore and changing with every passing year regardless of the efforts to mitigate its root causes. Livestock being a key source of employment to a large poor world population also contributes to food security and poverty eradication. With the changing climate livestock farmers are also making their farms compatible to the new natural ecosystem. Therefore, this study investigated how small livestock farmers having large ruminants inventory perceive changes in climate, which strategies they adapt and the factors influencing the adaptation of climate changes strategies in livestock. Primary data was collected from 180 small livestock farmers of Central Punjab, and multiple (step-wise) regression analysis was used to determine the factors affecting adaptation of climate change strategies. Livestock farmers are also well aware of the climate change as majority of the farmers (63.4% and 71.4%) perceived an increase in temperature and precipitation, respectively. Livestock farmers made an attempt to adopt conventional climate change strategies such as mix farming, reduction in animals, provision of more drinking water, use of tree shades, livestock diversification, use of muddy roof, and floor in order to cope with climate changes. The adoption of these measures was significantly influenced by animal inventory, climate knowledge, livestock working hours, livestock experience, distance of veterinary hospital, and livestock-related training/workshops. Government needs to increase technical and logistic capacity of veterinary doctors, and should create awareness among small livestock farmers through media. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The emerging ‘grand challenges’ of climate change, resource scarcity and population growth present a risk nexus to cities in the Anthropocene. This article discusses the potential that rapid urbanisation presents to help mitigate these risks through large-scale transitions if future urban development is delivered using evidence-based policies that promote regenerative urban outcomes (e.g. decarbonising energy, recycling water and waste, generating local food, integrating biodiversity). Observations from an Australian case study are used to describe urban governance approaches capable of supporting regenerative urbanism. The regenerative urbanism concept is associated with macro-scale urban and transport planning that shapes different urban fabrics (walking, transit, automobile), as the underlying infrastructure of each fabric exhibits a different performance, with automobile fabric being the least regenerative. Supporting urban systems based upon regenerative design principles at different scales (macro, meso and micro) can deliver deep and dramatic outcomes for not just reducing the impact of the grand challenges but turning them into regenerative change. In combination, these approaches form the cornerstone of regenerative cities that can address the grand challenges of the Anthropocene, while simultaneously improving livability and urban productivity to foster human flourishing. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2018.

AB  - Global warming and associated climate change are becoming a threat to almost all the ecosystems on the earth. According to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) special report 2019, the global mean surface (land and ocean) temperature has been increased by 0.87 °C while mean of land surface air temperature has increased by 1.53 °C since 1850-2015. Climate change is affecting food security and human life due to warming, changing precipitation patterns, and the greater frequency of some extreme events. The main cause of global warming is the continuous increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) like CO2, CH4, N2O and fluorinated gases due to several anthropogenic activities. Therefore, reducing the increasing concentration of GHG is necessary to slow down global warming and climate change. Among several options of greenhouse mitigation, application of biochar into the soil is gaining popularity due to several advantages over other options. Biochar is a highly stable form of carbon derived from pyrolysis of biomass at relatively low temperatures. Application of biochar into the soil has been reported to provide multiple benefits like increase in crop yield, nutrient and water use efficiency and several environmental benefits. Recalcitrant nature, relatively higher carbon content and easily available feedstock make biochar a highly sustainable and quick option for carbon sequestration into the soil. Biochar application into the soil not only helps in carbon sequestration but also provides a better option for managing agricultural residues. The application of biochar has also reported for reducing a considerable amount of methane and nitrous oxide emission from the agricultural field due to its priming effect on the soil. Biochar yield, physical properties, and carbon content varies with the type of feedstock and pyrolysis condition. Therefore, the rate of carbon sequestration and mitigation of greenhouse gas is also highly variable, however, the biochar application ultimately leads to a positive contribution towards climate change mitigation. However, most of the reported benefits are confined to laboratory and field trial at institute level, widespread adoption of biochar on farmer's field is still lacking. In the present chapter, all the aspects of biochar towards carbon sequestration and greenhouse mitigation have been well discussed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Fresh water—the bloodstream of the biosphere—is at the center of the planetary drama of the Anthropocene. Water fluxes and stores regulate the Earth's climate and are essential for thriving aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as water, food, and energy security. But the water cycle is also being modified by humans at an unprecedented scale and rate. A holistic understanding of freshwater's role for Earth system resilience and the detection and monitoring of anthropogenic water cycle modifications across scales is urgent, yet existing methods and frameworks are not well suited for this. In this paper we highlight four core Earth system functions of water (hydroclimatic regulation, hydroecological regulation, storage, and transport) and key related processes. Building on systems and resilience theory, we review the evidence of regional-scale regime shifts and disruptions of the Earth system functions of water. We then propose a framework for detecting, monitoring, and establishing safe limits to water cycle modifications and identify four possible spatially explicit methods for their quantification. In sum, this paper presents an ambitious scientific and policy grand challenge that could substantially improve our understanding of the role of water in the Earth system and cross-scale management of water cycle modifications that would be a complementary approach to existing water management tools. ©2020.

AB  - The availability of carbon (C) from high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and anthropogenic release of nitrogen (N) is increasing, but these increases are not paralleled by increases in levels of phosphorus (P). The current unstoppable changes in the stoichiometries of C and N relative to P have no historical precedent. We describe changes in P and N fluxes over the last five decades that have led to asymmetrical increases in P and N inputs to the biosphere. We identified widespread and rapid changes in N:P ratios in air, soil, water, and organisms and important consequences to the structure, function, and biodiversity of ecosystems. A mass-balance approach found that the combined limited availability of P and N was likely to reduce C storage by natural ecosystems during the remainder of the 21st Century, and projected crop yields of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment indicated an increase in nutrient deficiency in developing regions if access to P fertilizer is limited. Imbalances of the N:P ratio would likely negatively affect human health, food security, and global economic and geopolitical stability, with feedbacks and synergistic effects on drivers of global environmental change, such as increasing levels of CO2, climatic warming, and increasing pollution. We summarize potential solutions for avoiding the negative impacts of global imbalances of N:P ratios on the environment, biodiversity, climate change, food security, and human health. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Climate change vulnerability may differ among small farming communities and depend on combinations of multiple social and biophysical processes. In this study, we assessed vulnerability to climate change among maize-dependent smallholders in three districts of Ethiopia. Household socio-demographic factors, land use system, access to food, natural hazard, livelihood strategy and social network data were collected and subsequently analysed by the livelihood vulnerability index and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Vulnerability Index approaches. Results show that within the same production system, smallholder farmers experience different degrees of climate change vulnerability. This variation in climate change vulnerability is highly and significantly explained by very localized socio-economic factors such as household educational level, access to drought-resistant crop varieties, extent of family ties with social groups and local organizations, and quality of rural water supply and health infrastructures along with biophysical factors like land size and soil fertility status. It is, therefore, suggested that recognizing smallholder farmers’ relative vulnerability to climate change provides a range of effective coping strategies that would help to better build household resilience capacity and promote sustainable livelihood development. Hence, policymakers and development organizations need to focus on better strengthening human and institutional capacity through enhanced education and continuous training on climate change impact, and efficient and sustainable intensification through crop rotation, fertilizer use, rainwater harvesting and farm diversification that increase productivity by restoring soil and agroecosystem health. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Mountains are the water towers of the world, supplying a substantial part of both natural and anthropogenic water demands1,2. They are highly sensitive and prone to climate change3,4, yet their importance and vulnerability have not been quantified at the global scale. Here we present a global water tower index (WTI), which ranks all water towers in terms of their water-supplying role and the downstream dependence of ecosystems and society. For each water tower, we assess its vulnerability related to water stress, governance, hydropolitical tension and future climatic and socio-economic changes. We conclude that the most important (highest WTI) water towers are also among the most vulnerable, and that climatic and socio-economic changes will affect them profoundly. This could negatively impact 1.9 billion people living in (0.3 billion) or directly downstream of (1.6 billion) mountainous areas. Immediate action is required to safeguard the future of the world’s most important and vulnerable water towers. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - This chapter emphasises the contrasting features of diverse rice agro-ecosystems as a backdrop to review crop development, growth, and resource requirement; sink-source limitation for grain yield; response to abiotic factors; and management options for grain yield and quality. For rice ecosystems defined by water regime (irrigated lowland, rainfed lowland, upland), we discuss crop establishment, water saving methods, and mechanised production. The importance of germination and crop establishment in direct-seeded rice is emphasised, followed by an outline of environmental and genetic influences on phenological development and shoot and root growth. Crop growth is further analysed in terms of capture and efficiency in the use of radiation, water, and nitrogen, with a brief description of other nutrients. Sink-source limitation in grain yield examines how the grain sink develops and how source supply is used to fill the grain. Case studies of sink-source limitation show how more recent varieties, including hybrids, have increased both sink size and assimilate supply to achieve higher yield. In response to abiotic factors, the effects of water deficit, increased CO2 concentration, submergence, high temperature, low temperature, and salinity are reviewed. The chapter identifies six topics for future research: adaptation to reduced water input in irrigated systems; adaptation to drought in rainfed lowland rice; adaptation for mechanised farming; factors determining grain set; enhancing yield potential; and enhancing head rice yield. With increased pressure on global food security because of increasing human population, scarcity of water, greater reliance on more marginal land, and climate change, the identified topics for research in rice physiology under rice-based systems must be assigned the highest priority because of vulnerability of poor subsistence farmers and consumers reliant upon rice as their staple food. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Climate on earth has changed ordinarily amid the presence of our planet, going from the ice ages to times of warmth. During the most recent quite a few years increments in average air temperatures have been accounted for and associated consequences for atmosphere have been debated widely in an assortment of discussions. Because of its significance around the world, agriculture was one of the first divisions to be contemplated as far as potential effects of climate change. The agriculture was the key advancement in the ascending of current human civilization, whereby developing of domesticated species (Poultry and ranch creatures) produced sustenance which is fundamental for the practicality of the development. Nowadays, great awareness and concern for problems related to environmental quality, and human welfare, which are propagating at standalone terms subjected every day for debates and discussions such as climate change, biodiversity, soil fertility corrosion and beyond all food quality and pollution. Domesticated animals are the real consumers of water yet additionally support a considerable number of pastoralist and farmers’ families. In Egypt where water is a scarce item, there is a requirement for strategies to enhance livestock productivity. The complexity of the problems raised a combined with the heating of the global which called “Heat Stress” as a result of global climate changes, and the unlikelihood about numerous essential information regularly make discourses uncertain; even indication issued by scientific specialists are now and then misleading, and the problems are exacerbated by the continuous influence of ideological positions. A great net interaction gathering impact of climate change on soil, water, population growth, and energy, where more administrative and non-legislative tasks expected to supply farmers with high-quality seeds, high-quality forage with sufficient amount for animals, and veterinary administrations. In this way, thinking about the decent variety of farming frameworks, one rural strategy won’t fit all farmers’ classifications. Additionally, administrative and non-legislative administrations ought to be contemplated by the district and the season. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The different components of the Mediterranean Basin (land, coast, and sea) are undergoing significant changes due to mul-tiple anthropogenic pressures, including climate change, pol-lution and other factors. The 1st Mediterranean Assessment Report (MAR1), produced by the Mediterranean Experts on Climate and environmental Change (MedECC) and based on available scientific literature, provides a coherent and compre-hensive synthesis of the status of the Mediterranean Basin, its main drivers and their impacts on both ecosystems and human dimensions, with a focus on water, food, energy, ecosystems and ecosystem services, development, health and human security. The report is the first multidisciplinary, trans-boundary assessment produced for this region and provides significant input to inform policy at regional, national and local levels. Its ground-breaking nature lies in the scope of the scientific assessment as well as in displaying the regional capacity to coordinate exist-ing fragmented efforts in the region. The report highlights risks and possible response strategies that may help to increase the resilience to the effects of climate and environmental change. The conclusions show that effective policy responses, as well as in support of Sustainable Development Goals, encompass both strengthened mitigation of climate and environmental change and enhanced adaptation to their impacts. Socio-economic factors of poverty, inequalities and gender imbalances presently hamper the achievement of sustainable development and climate resilience in Mediterranean countries. © 2020, EMUNI Press.

AB  - The Chinese grassland ecosystem is an important national asset that not only impacts climate regulation, soil and water conservation, wind protection, and soil carbon and nitrogen fixation but is also an important contributor to maintaining grassland biodiversity while supporting livestock production. Grasslands are a key component contributing to the productivity of grazing animals but also provide basic food production via livestock grazing for herder survival. Grazing is the most basic means of grassland utilization but is considered one of the more important disturbance factors controllable by humans that has a universal and profound impact on the grassland ecosystem due to animal density and over grazing. For Alpine grasslands, it is not clear what grazing intensity (GI) can be achieved to improve plant biodiversity and vegetative nutritional value while improving sheep productivity. This field experiment was conducted for 7 yr comparing the impact of different GI on vegetation community characteristics, nutritional value, and sheep growth performance on the Alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The GI measured were: Control: 0 sheep/ ha; Low: 3.7 sheep/ha; Medium: 5.3 sheep/ha; and Heavy: 7.6 sheep/ha. The grazing experiment started in 2008, but experimental data collection and analyses were collected for the final 4 yr of 2015 through 2018. All grazing intensities &gt;0 sheep/ ha reduced (P &lt; 0.05) plant height (27%, 46%, and 48%, respectively, for 3.7, 5.3, and 7.6 sheep/ha), ground coverage (16%, 24%, and 48%), and above ground biomass (2%, 42% and 53%) of the various plant communities while increasing (P &lt; 0.05) the grass community density (individuals/m2) compared to a nongrazed Control. With increasing GI, the community height, coverage, and above-ground biomass decreased (P &lt; 0.05), and the plant community density increased then decreased (P &lt; 0.05) compared to Control. As GI increased, the available community biomass nutritional quality increased (P &lt; 0.05). Comprehensive analysis showed that the community density (quantity) and nutritional quality were the highest when the GI was 5.3 sheep/ha. The higher the GI, the greater the grass's nutritive value with lower above-ground net primary production (ANPP). When GI was the highest, the average daily gain (ADG) per hectare was the highest in the short term, but the highest GI endangers the ANPP and profitability of the grassland grazing ecosystem in the long term. Targeting a moderate GI (5.3 sheep/ha) can provide 78% of the ADG per hectare of the highest GI, which meets the requirement of maintaining a sustainable grazing grassland. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Flash Floods are a common natural disaster occurring in many parts of the arid regions. The flashfloods severely threaten the infrastructures, human lives destroying their livelihood, moreover affecting the country’s business, economy, and threaten the archeological areas. Egypt economy depends on archeological tourism because it represents one of the very important resources of national income in Egypt. Natural disasters (e.g., floods, landslides, sand/dust storms, etc.) have become during the past four decades widespread dangerous problems in many parts of the world, including the Arab countries, thus contributing to increase in poverty and threatening food security. Today’s society becomes rapidly vulnerable to natural disasters due to climate changes, growing urban populations, severe human degradation of marginal lands, and disturbance of formerly stable ecosystems, as well as a lack of natural resource management, land use planning, and preparedness. Several technical reasons connected to population pressures are aggravating the intensity of flooding in the Arab countries becoming as such tragedies and bringing disasters in their wake. Flooding disasters have created, during the last years, widespread environmental, social, and economic destruction in several Arab countries. Floods cause severe degradation reshaping natural landscapes, sedimentation in reservoirs and waterways, disruption of lake ecosystems, and contamination of drinking water. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The ecological footprint has far surpassed the biocapacity of our globe to fulfill the current requirement of the people living on the earth which needs sustainable vision with synergic alternative/option to meet the current human demand without compromising the need for the future generation. We examined the various SDGs goals with respect to agroforestry capacity and contribution based on available literature and knowledge. The study provides a better understanding of the synergic approach/strategies with retrospective and prospective ways for choosing agroforestry exercise which is an effective mechanism for providing multi-dimensional ecosystem services without interruption in achieving the majority of SDGs goals. The outcome of the evaluation highlights that agroforestry can contribute very significantly and can play a vital role in SDG-1, SDG-2, SDG-11, SDG-13, and SDG-15 directly in mitigating poverty, contributing towards food security, improving in creating a viable healthy city and in providing a sustainable overall prosperous environment in the prevailing climate change setup whereas indirectly it can serve others SDGs goals simultaneously that aim to provide better health and education, women empowerment, effective contribution towards clean water and energy for all sections of the society/citizen. The analysis further concluded although agroforestry has a vibrant future and hope it will get adequate priority in various countries with a focus on policy and investment. © 2020 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

AB  - The current large-scale land use is unprecedented in human history. Approximately three-quarters of the world's ice-free land surface is under the influence of human use. Approximately 60-85% forests and 70-90% of other natural ecosystems are used by humans. Almost a third of the global primary potential net production is used by humans. Land use contributes around a quarter to global greenhouse gas emissions through deforestation, rice-growing, livestock farming and the use of fertilizer. Higher temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are changing the growing season, contributing to a regional reduction in crop yields and reduced availability of fresh water. It also puts biodiversity under further pressure. However, good landhuman use. Approximately 60-85% forests and 70-90% of other natural ecosystems are used by humans.

AB  - The contributors to and consequences of disordered health are increasingly complex with sociodemographic, ecological, economic and food system change. But there are opportunities for any adversity to be mitigated by advances in the understanding of human, especially nutritional, ecobiology and in its more accessible and affordable evaluation and monitoring. Viral pandemics are on the rise with climate change and loss of ecosystems. They threaten human civilisation and planetary habitability. Human security is dependent on sustainable livelihoods of which food and water systems are a vital part. We are socioecological beings and depend for our health on biodiversity and the food diversity that ensures; and on connectedness and communication, made more difficult in pandemics. Rapid and accessible point-of-care (POC) tools are now becoming available to compliment other selfmonitoring network approaches, whether checklist or questionnaire, physical, chemical, or biological, for healthcare and nutritional health. They can provide information as several complimentary and interdependent health indices to facilitate personal, group and community action and management plans. This applies to indices of both communicable and non-communicable disease which problems separately and together are compromising health prospects. These indices include ones of physical and mental activities, dietary patterns, metabolites, blood pressure and now the presence and severity of viruses like Covid-19.Of imminent relevance and promise are opti-cally-readable biosensor based strips for nasal, pharyngeal or salivary samples to check viral presence or finger prick blood for immunoglobulins and interleukins. These should allow less socially prohibitive measures to curb viral transmission and promote personal and societal wellbeing. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Spatiotemporal trends in soil moisture are of considerable importance within the food-energy-water nexus. Soil moisture dictates the productivity of ecosystems, plays a major role in land-atmosphere interactions, influences climate change projections, and shapes future water security. Monitoring of long-term soil moisture trends has proven useful for managing water resource allocation and developing solutions to global water security challenges. Thus, we examine annual trends in surface soil moisture throughout the U.S. Great Plains region from 1987 to 2016 using data from NASA's observation- driven SPoRT-LIS land surface model at 3 km resolution. Results reveal a drying trend in soil moisture for a majority of the U.S. Great Plains, although wetter conditions have been realized in the northernmost region of the Missouri River basin. These results, when coupled with climate change-driven increases in temperature and evapotranspiration, will inevitably drive baseline soil moisture to drier conditions in the future. Under drying soil moisture conditions, future agricultural production and water resource management in the U.S. Great Plains will become increasingly complicated, thereby threatening future food and water security. However, these results can be applied to inform and improve climate change adaptation strategies in order to ensure adequate volumes of freshwater to meet future human and environmental water demand. © 2020 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Agriculture is an important sector that provides food, fiber, and fuel, and other vital commodities which possibly sustains life on Earth. In recent time, the growing human population demands a large amount of agriculture commodities to fulfill the need. Therefore, agriculture has been escalating rapidly, which introduced various modern practices and technologies that affect the environment in many ways. The excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides contaminates the air, water, and soil. Although the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides enhances crop productivity, it also deteriorates the soil health. There is a need to explore the economically sound and ecologically viable alternatives which can address these concerns. Numerous sustainable cropping practices like the application of biofertilizer, slow-release fertilizers, biochar, vermicompost, zero or low tillage, etc., have been investigated and found substantially effective. In the present chapter, a thorough discussion about these technologies has been made. Moreover, how these technologies can be incorporated with modern/corporate agricultural tools has also been explored. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

AB  - Background. In arid environments, plant primary productivity is generally low and highly variable both spatially and temporally. Resources are not evenly distributed in space and time (e.g., soil nutrients, water), and depend on global (El Niño/ Southern Oscillation) and local climate parameters. The launch of the Sentinel2-satellite, part of the European Copernicus program, has led to the provision of freely available data with a high spatial resolution (10 m per pixel). Here, we aimed to test whether Sentinel2-imagery can be used to quantify the spatial variability of a minor tussock grass (Enneapogon spp.) in an Australian arid area and whether we can identify different vegetation cover (e.g., grass from shrubs) along different temporal scenarios. Although short-lasting, the Enneapogon grassland has been identified as a key primary food source to animals in the arid environment. If we are able to identify and monitor the productivity of this species remotely, it will provide an important new tool for examining food resource dynamics and subsequent animal responses to them in arid habitat. Methods. We combined field vegetation surveys and Sentinel2-imagery to test if satellite spectral data can predict the spatial variability of Enneapogon over time, through GLMMs. Additionally, a cluster analysis ('gower' distance, 'complete' method), based on Enneapogon seed-productivity, and total vegetation cover in October 2016, identified three clusters: bare ground, grass dominated and shrub dominated. We compared the vegetation indices between these different clusters from October 2016 to January 2017. Results. We found that MSAVI2 and NDVI correlated with the proportion of Enneapogon with seeds across the landscape and this relationship changed over time. Both vegetation indices (MSAVI2 and NDVI) were higher in patches with high seed-productivity of Enneapogon than in bare soil, but only in October, a climatically-favorable period during which this dominant grass reached peak seed-productivity. Discussion. MSAVI2 and NDVI provided reliable estimates of the heterogeneity of vegetation type across the landscape only when measured in the Austral spring. This means that grass cover is related to seed-productivity and it is possible to remotely and reliably predict food resource availability in arid habitat, but only in certain conditions. The lack of significant differences between clusters in the summer was likely driven by the short-lasting nature of the vegetation in the study and the sparseness of the grass-dominated vegetation, in contrast to the shrub vegetation cluster that was particularly well measured by the NDVI. Conclusions. Overall, our study highlights the potential for Sentinel2-imagery to estimate and monitor the change in grass seed availability remotely in arid environments. However, heterogeneity in grassland cover is not as reliably measured as other types of vegetation and may only be well detected during periods of peak productivity (e.g., October 2016). © 2020 Funghi et al.

AB  - An assessment of land users perceptions of the potentiality of organic farming practices and efficient use of land in reducing drought and land degradation impacts on land, water and food security has been carried out in the Barind Tract of Bangladesh. Of the issues that Bangladesh faces today, land degradation due to aridity and drought is important and has resulted in economic loss and human sufferings. Drought has impacts on dietary diversity and food security in the high drought prone areas. It was found that the low drought prone area shows greater farm and homestead diversity. The study also found that climate change, faulty land management, groundwater extraction, indiscriminate use of agrochemicals, deforestation and other human induced factors are exacerbating the effects of frequent drought on land degradation and are threatening food insecurity. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Water and nutrients have global cycles; it’s based on rivers those systems collect and involve land, oceans and the atmosphere. Most rivers end in estuaries where freshwater meets the saltwater. The Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) region features major watersheds and usually those end in extensive wetlands and then estuaries. Many estuaries of world relevance are fed by the HKH watersheds affecting global biodiversity, biomass and carbon sequestration, but also human civilizations! The productivity of rivers and their estuaries can affect human well-being, entire nations, the global economy and even trigger warfare. Here an overview is shown for river outflows, the major estuaries in the HKH region such as the Yellow Sea, the Mekong, the Sea of Okhotsk, the deltas of the Ganges and the Indus. Central Asian wetlands fed by rivers but not ending in oceans are also covered in this assessment, e.g. Aral and Balkash Lakes. While mapping the HKH area has been ongoing for centuries, precise maps of the dynamic wetlands and estuaries, within a good time frame and available - are rare making impact assessment tricky. Even for tsunami forecasts (where human lives are lost and precise coastline maps are needed with a 1 m accuracy or better) such data rarely exist. Man-made climate change- namely melting glaciers, floods and brackish water inflow - are creating major changes in those millennia-old life-systems and human societies. The status and connectivity of those estuaries are discussed and how they affect global society. Arguably, we are facing a global river, estuary and ocean crisis still to be addressed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that climate change is a growing social and economic burden. More-over, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are at risk of falling short of their intended targets. The difficulties will only be made worse as the climate and economic burdens grow. A growing literature suggests that the problems largely stem from the non-productive use of resources which erode our social and economic well-being-especially over the long haul. These huge inefficiencies include the non-productive use of capital, materials, water, food, and especially energy. One assessment notes that, depending on how we ignore global ecosystems or, more hopefully, how we might build up a more healthy and resilient environmental capacity, "the global value of ecosystem services can decline by $51 trillion/yr or increase by $30 trillion/yr" by the year 2040 (with values in 2007 dollars). At the same time, moving to a smarter and more productive use of all resources requires a larger number of institutional changes. Such changes range from the use of new metrics to assess future opportunities to an array of policies and perspectives that promote these changes. In this special issue we review a number of different ways that institutional changes might create opportunities in which all resources might be managed more productively. While no single special issue can cover all elements of the necessary institutional changes, nor can even a series of books on the topic, this is another step forward to open up thinking more along the lines of human and cultural dimensions toward a better understanding of how resources might be more productively used for social and economic benefits. © 2020 Editorial Board of the Journal Economic Policy.

AB  - Climate change has been recognized as one of the most critical and controversial issues facing the world in the twenty-first century. It is predicted to lead to adverse and irreversible impacts on the earth and ecosystems as a whole. This chapter discusses the causes of climate change and current and potential impacts that will affect the people now and in the coming decades while providing a comprehensive account of how Pacific Island nations face challenges from climate change-related impacts. Global warming, sea-level rise, changing weather patterns and extreme events, pressure on water and food security, human health risks, and impacts on wildlife and ecosystems are considered as major impacts of climate change. Pacific Island countries register the greatest negative impacts of climate change even though they account for only 0.03% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Current and projected climate change poses a set of fundamental challenges to the local economy and livelihoods, resulting in human mobility and cross-border displacement and migration. The dispersed nature and heterogeneity of the Pacific Island countries presents special challenges for localized climate projections and adaptation strategies. Effective adaptation measures and policies to climate change impacts in the Pacific Islands should acknowledge their unique environmental and cultural characteristics. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Climate change is transforming aquatic ecosystems. Coastal waters have experienced progressive warming, acidification, and deoxygenation that will intensify this century. At the same time, there is a scientific consensus that the public health, recreation, tourism, fishery, aquaculture, and ecosystem impacts from harmful algal blooms (HABs) have all increased over the past several decades. The extent to which climate change is intensifying these HABs is not fully clear, but there has been a wealth of research on this topic this century alone. Indeed, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) approved in September 2019 was the first IPCC report to directly link HABs to climate change. In the Summary for Policy Makers, the report made the following declarations with “high confidence”: • Harmful algal blooms display range expansion and increased frequency in coastal areas since the 1980s in response to both climatic and non-climatic drivers such as increased riverine nutrients run-off. • The observed trends in harmful algal blooms are attributed partly to the effects of ocean warming, marine heatwaves, oxygen loss, eutrophication and pollution. • Harmful algal blooms have had negative impacts on food security, tourism, local economy, and human health. In addition, the report specifically outlines a series of linkages between heat waves and HABs. These statements about HABs and climate change and the high levels of confidence ascribed to them provides clear evidence that the field of HABs and climate change has matured and has, perhaps, reached a first plateau of certainty. While there are well-documented global trends in HABs being promoted by human activity, including climate change, individual events are driven by local, regional, and global drivers, making it critical to carefully evaluate the conditions and responses at appropriate scales. It is within this context that the first Special Issue on Climate Change and Harmful Algal Blooms is published in Harmful Algae. © 2019 The Author

AB  - The devastations and damages caused by climate change are apparent across the globe, specifically in the South Asian region where vulnerabilities to climate change among residents are high and climate change adaptation and mitigation awareness are extremely low. Pakistan’s low adaptive capacity due to high poverty rate, limited financial resources and shortage of physical resources, and continual extreme climatic events including varying temperature, continual flooding, melting glaciers, saturation of lakes, earthquakes, hurricanes, storms, avalanches, droughts, scarcity of water, pest diseases, human healthcare issues, and seasonal and lifestyle changes have persistently threatened the ecosystem, biodiversity, human communities, animal habitations, forests, lands, and oceans with a potential to cause further damages in the future. The likely effect of climate change on common residents of Pakistan with comparison to the world and their per capita impact of climate change are terribly high with local animal species such as lions, vultures, dolphins, and tortoise facing extinction regardless of generating and contributing diminutively to global GHG emissions. The findings of the review suggested that GHG emissions cause climate change which has impacted agriculture livestock and forestry, weather trends and patterns, food water and energy security, and society of Pakistan. This review is a sectorial evaluation of climate change mitigation and adaption approaches in Pakistan in the aforementioned sectors and its economic costs which were identified to be between 7 to 14 billion USD per annum. The research suggested that governmental interference is essential for sustainable development of the country through strict accountability of resources and regulation implemented in the past for generating state-of-the-art climate policy. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - We conducted a paleolimnological study to examine how changes in human activity interacted with climate to influence productivity and biodiversity over the past millennium in oligotrophic Lake Atnsjøen, SE Norway. The study included analyses of sediment geochemistry, subfossil diatoms and cladocerans, and macrofossils. Results were compared with the historical record of human activities in the catchment, pollen analysis and paleoclimate inferences from the lake. During the first 750 years of the record (1000–1750 CE), a time of relatively low human activity, lake productivity and biodiversity were strongly related to climate. During the Little Ice Age (1550–1800 CE), lake productivity and diatom diversity were constrained by cold climate. A century of climate warming (1780–1880 CE) initiated an increase in productivity. Accelerated human settlement after 1850 CE, however, had an even stronger impact on productivity, mediated by increased agriculture and/or forestry, which led to greater nutrient loading of the lake. Similarly, diatoms in the lake responded to the rise in temperature, but increasing human activity also had a moderate impact on the diatom community, which displayed weak signs of nutrient enrichment. From 1980 to 1990 CE onwards, lake productivity declined as a consequence of a recent decrease in human activity and changing land use. The human-induced increase in lake productivity starting ca. 1850 CE propagated through the food web and increased consumer productivity, as reflected by greater accumulation rates of cladocerans, trichopterans and turbellarians. The cladoceran community was likely under top-down control of fish, as indicated by changes in size structure and diversity. Our study showed that increasing human activity during the settlement period had a stronger impact on lake productivity than did climate. Furthermore, the slight human-mediated increase in nutrient loading had different impacts on productivity and biodiversity in the study lake. This study demonstrates that even relatively small changes in human activities in watersheds can have measurable impacts on nutrient-poor lakes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This study provides a review of benefit and losses of greenhouse gases (GHGs). For the last decades, the average global temperature is rising on the surface as well as on the oceans. There are a number of factors behind this rise, but the main cause of this rise is anthropogenic increase in GHGs. The anthropogenic factors comprise of burning of fossil fuel, coal mining, industrialization etc. During the last century, the CO2 concentration increased by 391 PPM, CH4 and N2 O have reached at warming levels. The rise in overall temperature is changing the living pattern of humans and it also damages the economy as well as ecosystem for other living species. The rising GHGs concentration may also have some positive effects on the economy, but it has heavy costs as well. GHGs are responsible for the change in climate which include a rise in sea level, ice melting from ice sheets and ocean acidification and climate change is responsible for the other damages like low fresh water resources, damage to the coastal system, damage to human health and raise the issue of food security. © 2019, Econjournals.

AB  - Background: Cities are an important driving force to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the New Urban Agenda. The SDGs provide an operational framework to consider urbanization globally, while providing local mechanisms for action and careful attention to closing the gaps in the distribution of health gains. While health and well-being are explicitly addressed in SDG 3, health is also present as a pre condition of SDG 11, that aims at inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities. Health in All Policies (HiAP) is an approach to public policy across sectors that systematically takes into account the health implications of decisions, seeks synergies, and avoids harmful health impacts in order to improve population health and health equity. HiAP is key for local decision-making processes in the context of urban policies to promote public health interventions aimed at achieving SDG targets. HiAPs relies heavily on the use of scientific evidence and evaluation tools, such as health impact assessments (HIAs). HIAs may include city-level quantitative burden of disease, health economic assessments, and citizen and other stakeholders' involvement to inform the integration of health recommendations in urban policies. The Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal)'s Urban Planning, Environment and Health Initiative provides an example of a successful model of translating scientific evidence into policy and practice with regards to sustainable and healthy urban development. The experiences collected through ISGlobal's participation implementing HIAs in several cities worldwide as a way to promote HiAP are the basis for this analysis. Aim: The aim of this article is threefold: To understand the links between social determinants of health, environmental exposures, behaviour, health outcomes and urban policies within the SDGs, following a HiAP rationale;to review and analyze the key elements of a HiAP approach as an accelerator of the SDGs in the context of urban and transport planning; A nd to describe lessons learnt from practical implementation of HIAs in cities across Europe, Africa and Latin-America. Methods: We create a comprehensive, urban health related SDGs conceptual framework, by linking already described urban health dimensions to existing SDGs, targets and indicators. We discuss, taking into account the necessary conditions and steps to conduct HiAP, the main barriers and opportunities within the SDGs framework. We conclude by reviewing HIAs in a number of cities worldwide (based on the experiences collected by co-authors of this publication), including city-level quantitative burden of disease and health economic assessments, as practical tools to inform the integration of health recommendations in urban policies. Results: A conceptual framework linking SDGs and urban and transportplanning, environmental exposures, behaviour and health outcomes, following a HiAP rationale, is designed. We found at least 38 SDG targets relevant to urban health, corresponding to 15 SDGs, while 4 important aspects contained in our proposed framework were not present in the SDGs (physical activity, noise, quality of life or social capital). Thus, a more comprehensive HiAP vision within the SDGs could be beneficial. Our analysis confirmed that the SDGs framework provides an opportunity to formulate and implement policies with a HiAP approach. Three important aspects are highlighted: 1) the importance of the intersectoral work and health equity as a cross-cutting issue in sustainable development endeavors;2) policy coherence, health governance, and stakeholders' participation as key issues; A nd 3) the need for high quality data. HIAs are a practical tool to implement HiAP. Opportunities and barriers related to the political, legal and health governance context, the capacity to inform policies in other sectors, the involvement of different stakeholders, and the availability of quality data are discussed based on our experience. Quantitative assessments can provide powerful data such as: Estimates of annual preventable morbidity and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) under compliance with international exposure recommendations for physical activity, exposure to air pollution, noise, heat, and access to green spaces;the associated economic impacts in health care costs per year; A nd the number of preventable premature deaths when improvements in urban and transport planning are implemented. This information has been used to support the design of policies that promote cycling, walking, public, zero and low-emitting modes of transport, and the provision of urban greening or healthy public open spaces in Barcelona (e.g. Urban Mobility, Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plans, or the Superblocks's model), the Bus Rapid Transit and Open Streets initiatives in several Latin American cities or targeted SDGs assessments in Morocco. Conclusions: By applying tools such as HIA, HiAP can be implemented to inform and improve transport and urban planning to achieve the 2030 SDG Agenda. Such a framework could be potentially used in cities worldwide, including those of less developed regions or countries. Data availability, taking into account equity issues, strenghtening the communication between experts, decision makers and citizens, and the involvement of all major stakeholders are crucial elements for the HiAP approach to translate knowledge into SDG implementation. ©2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) have been playing a crucial role in meeting the basic needs of millions of people around the world. Despite this, the sustainability of global fisheries is a growing concern, and the factors enabling or constraining the sustainable management of small-scale fisheries remain poorly understood. Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) is the single most valuable species harvested in Bangladesh waters, serves nutrition, income, and employment to the large population. This study analyzed the state and challenges of hilsa fishery in the Gangetic River systems (Padma and Meghna Rivers) by using two frameworks, namely the social-ecological systems (SES) and drivers-pressure-state-impact-responses (DPSIR) frameworks. Primary data for this analysis were collected by in-depth interviews (n = 130) and focus group discussions (n = 8) with various stakeholders in the hilsa fisheries. The perspectives explored here have been both critical and constructive, including the identification of problems and suggestions for improving the management of this particular social-ecological system. Hilsa fisheries, however, have come under severe threat since 2003 because of population growth, overfishing, pollution, climate change, the disruption of migration routes due to siltation, etc. All these have caused reduced catches and less stable incomes for fishers. This, in turn, has led to poverty, malnutrition, social tensions, stakeholder conflicts, and debt cycles amongst more impoverished fishing communities. These problems have been compounded by improved fishing technology amongst larger-scale ventures, the use of illegal fishing gears, and the non-compliance of government fishery management programs. Recommendations include the promotion of community-supported fisheries, the enhancement of stakeholder’s social resilience, the introduction of co-management approach, an increase in incentives and formal financial supports, and possible community-managed sustainable ecotourism including hilsa fishing-based tourism. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Since 1945, the reasons for major crises and how the world responds to them have changed every 10-15 years or sooner. Whereas these crises vary greatly across global regions, their economic, environmental, ecological, social, and disease aspects are increasingly under the influence of widely integrated global changes and forces arising primarily from: climate extremes; rapid unsustainable urbanization; critical biodiversity losses; and emergencies of scarcity in water, food, and energy. These slow-moving but increasingly severe crises affect larger populations across many borders and lead to the emergence of increasing population-based, preventable public health emergencies related to water, sanitation, food, shelter, energy, and related health illnesses, and ultimately global health security. This report explores the impact of these crises on Asia and the Pacific region, and their potential for regional conflict. © 2019 World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine.

AB  - China's Loess Plateau is the largest loess deposit in the world in terms of both depth and area. Water storage in soils of the Plateau has direct impacts on food security, human health and ecosystem function. Despite extensive research on the behavior and function of soil water in the Plateau, there is no state-of-the-art review that presents research achievements, gaps and future perspectives. This paper reviews the advances in soil water research and highlights future research needs and challenges in the Loess Plateau, and thereby provides informed decision on sustainable water management. We report that considerable efforts have been made to investigate: i) soil water movement and hydraulic property estimation in the typical loess regions; ii) spatial and temporal variations in soil water content and storage at multiple scales; iii) dried soil layers induced by excessive water use from unreasonable artificial revegetation; and iv) soil water availability and water carrying capacity of typical vegetation types on the Loess Plateau. These studies have greatly enhanced our understanding about the fundamental characteristics, spatio-temporal patterns and natural and anthropogenic controls of soil water distribution and water cycles in the Loess Plateau, which in turn have important implications for the regulation and management of water resources toward sustainable ecological construction. Based on the identified key issues and future research priorities, recommendations were drawn to address unsolved problems, including: i) processes and mechanisms controlling water transport and interactions within the groundwater–soil–plant–atmosphere continuum; ii) how soil hydrological processes couple nutrient cycles in response to climate change and human activities; and iii) development of quantitative models across spatial scales for modeling changes in thresholds of soil water carrying capacity for vegetation. The incorporation of research findings into policy and practice can improve soil water management that will in turn significantly benefit the promotion of ecosystem services and functions in the Loess Plateau. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To meet the United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals and the European Union (EU) strategy for a non-toxic environment, water resources and ecosystems management require cost-efficient solutions for prevailing complex contamination and multiple stressor exposures. For the protection of water resources under global change conditions, specific research needs for prediction, monitoring, assessment and abatement of multiple stressors emerge with respect to maintaining human needs, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Collaborative European research seems an ideal instrument to mobilize the required transdisciplinary scientific support and tackle the large-scale dimension and develop options required for implementation of European policies. Calls for research on minimizing society’s chemical footprints in the water–food–energy–security nexus are required. European research should be complemented with targeted national scientific funding to address specific transformation pathways and support the evaluation, demonstration and implementation of novel approaches on regional scales. The foreseeable pressure developments due to demographic, economic and climate changes require solution-oriented thinking, focusing on the assessment of sustainable abatement options and transformation pathways rather than on status evaluation. Stakeholder involvement is a key success factor in collaborative projects as it allows capturing added value, to address other levels of complexity, and find smarter solutions by synthesizing scientific evidence, integrating governance issues, and addressing transition pathways. This increases the chances of closing the value chain by implementing novel solutions. For the water quality topic, the interacting European collaborative projects SOLUTIONS, MARS and GLOBAQUA and the NORMAN network provide best practice examples for successful applied collaborative research including multi-stakeholder involvement. They provided innovative conceptual, modelling and instrumental options for future monitoring and management of chemical mixtures and multiple stressors in European water resources. Advancement of EU water framework directive-related policies has therefore become an option. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The unprecedented surge in urbanization and population growth rates is generating multiple impacts, affecting food, energy and water (FEW hereafter) demands. Moreover, the adverse effects are extending to climate, as well as to human and ecosystem health. Coordinated efforts are often deemed critical to minimize the trade-offs while maximizing the synergies in the use and the effective analysis of the interlinkages among food, energy, and water within urban ecosystems. Data are collected and transformed into useful information through different indicators, which are often applied to guide several policies in the urban domain. However, their different nature now asks for a critical reanalysis to collate them into different groups, understanding their guiding principles and identifying possible gaps for further policy- and design-oriented studies. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art on existing urban FEW nexus indicators. Indicators were found to belong to four main distinct groups, measuring resource fluxes (52%); quantifying environmental impacts (13%), and efficiency aspects (29%). Results highlight a need to develop new indicators, considering the inclusion of all involved factors within new integrated metrics. However, prior to developing an overall sustainability indicator system is presented, it would be vital to incorporate as many flows as possible to represent the entire urban systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Human activities change the structure and function of the environment with cascading impacts on human health, a concept known as “planetary health.” Agroforestry—the management of trees with crops and livestock—alters microclimates, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and biodiversity. Besides the nutritional benefits of increased fruit consumption, however, the ways agroforestry affects human health are rarely articulated. This review makes that link. We analyze the pathways through which tree-based farm and landscape change affect food and nutrition security, the spread of infectious disease, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, and human migration in Sub-Saharan Africa. The available evidence suggests that, despite some increased risks of infectious disease, agroforestry is likely to improve a diverse range of pressing health concerns. We therefore examine the factors determining agroforestry use and identify three drivers of social and environmental change that will determine the future uptake of agroforestry in the region. Thirty percent of Sub-Saharan Africa's cropland has at least 10% tree cover. The available evidence indicates that agroforestry drives environmental change, which can improve a diverse range of pressing health concerns such as malnutrition, spread of infectious disease, prevalence of non-communicable disease, and human migration. This, however, does not always apply: transdisciplinary, participatory approaches are needed to dive more deeply into specific land-management systems to identify synergies and tradeoffs among health outcomes. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - While the Earth observation (EO) data and geospatial information technology (GIT) are getting more open and accessible, lack of skilled human resources and institutional capacities are limiting effective applications in the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. This paper aims to present the capacity building approach and applications designed to fill these gaps and empower decision makers and practitioners in using EO data and GIT through information education and training. The capacity building approach consists of four components: assessment, design, implementation, and monitoring (ADIM). The assessment component focuses on identifying the needs and priorities of capacity building for targeted groups or institutions. The design component develops training content in order to execute the plan in coordination with subject matter experts (SME). The implementation component executes the capacity building activity in any of these four formats—standard training, training of trainers, on-the-job training, and exposure learning. The monitoring component helps to identify the participants' expectations, learning achievements, and feedback so as to improve future capacity building events. In the application of ADIM, we conducted needs assessment in four countries, designed 26 types of capacity building contents and implemented 39 capacity building events. A range of thematic topics—from agriculture and food security, water resources and hydro-climatic disasters, land use, land cover and ecosystem, weather and climate services, to crosscutting issues—were covered in the events. Altogether, the activities reached out to over 1,000 individuals (35% of them women) from over 200 unique institutions in 30 countries. Institutional capacity was built for universities in Afghanistan and Bangladesh to design and deliver courses independently. The capacity of partner agencies were built to co-design and co-develop data and applications. The approach also experienced challenges in the nomination process and in identifying women participants due to the lack of women professionals in the field and in the respective agencies. The ADIM approach and its workflow focused on bridging the gap between the current trend and progression in EO and GIT fields and the existing state of capacity of the agencies involved in the decision-making process. It promoted gender equity, adopted frontier technologies, engaged SMEs and provided sustainable solutions, which are starting to bring success stories in the region. © Copyright © 2019 Thapa, Matin and Bajracharya.

AB  - Managing complex social-ecological systems in an era of rapid climate change and changing human pressures represents a major challenge in sustainability science. The Sierra Nevada, USA is a large social-ecological system facing a tipping point that could result in major ecosystem changes. A century of fire suppression and climate change have set the stage for mega-disturbances that threaten biodiversity, human life and values, ecosystem services, and forest persistence. Stakeholders face multidimensional and often contentious trade-offs with costs and benefits that can be mismatched in space and time. If compromises cannot be reached, the status quo is likely to continue, resulting in the conversion of large portions of a 100 000 km2 predominately mixed-conifer forest ecosystem to a chaparral-dominated ecosystem. We describe the outcomes of a continuation of the ecological status quo on biodiversity, cultural history, fire management, recreational value, and climate control, including indirect effects on water and food security and recreation. The social-ecological ramifications of such a future are undesirable for most stakeholders. Therefore, we contend that forest management conflicts should be framed in terms of the cost of failure of negotiations among stakeholders. Specifically, negotiations may benefit from (1) stakeholders quantifying their definitions of success and failure, (2) quantification of trade-offs and recognition of their multidimensionality, and (3) allowing for solutions that are heterogeneous in space and time. This approach may help stakeholders navigate the wicked problem of managing Sierra Nevada forests and other complex social-ecological systems. © 2019 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Soil security identifies global challenges and a series of dimensions that are necessary requirements to meet those global challenges using sustainable land management. The soil security concept is applied to two contrasting soil landscape systems with varying climate, landform and soil types. Previous methodologies for assessing land and soil capability are combined within the soil security conceptual approach. The land and soil capability methodologies are used to assess how the soil condition changes in response to the stresses and forcing associated with land management and land and soil degradation processes. It is the soil capability that defines how the soil condition changes between the reference state of the soil condition, or the genoform, and the soil condition under land use, or the phenoform. The conclusion is that soil capability, which is one of the dimensions used to apply the soil security concept, is a complex dimension and has several aspects or further facets to be considered to achieve sustainable land management. It is apparent that in assessing soil capability, the following facets are relevant. I: The capacity of the soil to provide ecosystem services to meet the global challenges outlined for Soil Security. II: The stability of the soil condition to land degradation processes resulting from the effects of land management practices and the environmental stresses on the soil. III: The capacity to recover following degradation. Facets II and III can be considered the resilience. An important conclusion is that the soil capability cannot be assessed without taking into account features of the landscape including climate and landform. Two examples from south eastern Australia of the application of these facets of soil capability to on-ground situations are presented. The Cowra Trough Red Soils in the Australian wheat belt are a set of soils, primarily contributing to meeting the global challenge of food security. The major degradation processes threatening the stability of these soils are water erosion and soil acidification. The Kosciusko National Park in the Snowy Mountains region is primarily contributing to meeting the challenges of water security for the irrigation industry in the Murray Darling Basins and energy security through the production of hydroelectricity. The set of soil landscapes also contributes to biodiversity protection and human health and well-being. The major degradation processes threatening the stability of these soils and their capacity to meet the global challenges are water and wind erosion. A major limitation is the poor capacity of these soils to recover once degraded. Identifying the main ecosystem services provided by the two examples, together with the major risks of land degradation can clarify extension, economic and policy aspects of sustainable land management for the two sets of soil landscapes. For the Cowra Trough Red Soils, management of water erosion and soil acidification are essential for maintaining the contribution of the area to food security. For the Kosciusko National Park, the control of water and wind erosion are essential to maintain the contribution of the area to water and energy security. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Agricultural soils contribute to human welfare through their generation of manifold ecosystem services such as food security, water quality and climate regulation, but these are degraded by common farming practices. We have developed a roadmap for evaluating the contribution of both private- and public-good ecosystem services generated by agricultural soils to societal welfare. The approach considers the needs of decision-makers at different levels, from farmers to policy-makers. This we achieve through combining production functions-to quantify the impacts of alternative management practices on agricultural productivity and soil ecosystem services-with non-market valuation of changes in public-good ecosystem services and benefit-cost analysis. The results show that the net present value to society of implementing soil-friendly measures are substantial, but negative for farmers in our study region. Although we apply our roadmap to an intensive farming region in Sweden, we believe our results have broad applicability, because farmers do not usually account for the value of public-good ecosystem services. We therefore conclude that market outcomes are not likely to be generating optimal levels of soil ecosystem services from society's perspective. Innovative governance institutions are needed to resolve this market failure to safeguard the welfare of future generations. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - More than 50 years after the first comprehensively designed projects, the significance of research on past societies and their interactions with landscapes has even increased: Studying arid landscapes opens many areas of general interest about adapted lifestyles and livelihoods, since aridity touches upon problems of desertification and climate change, decentral water and food security. This synoptical paper sheds light onto the premises, functionalities and questions of water harvesting systems in antiquity and asks about the implications of runoff-based economies and societies in the Old World Dry Belt. By comparing results and considerations of the individual contributions to this special issue on ancient water management in general, and water and soil harvesting in particular and other relevant studies, it aims at extracting commonalities and differences between the interlinkages of environmental conditions and human intervention.Moreover, it embeds the various approaches, methods and results of the special issue's authors into overarching considerations oriented towards achieved results, application-oriented aspects and towards focal open questions. Differential analysis of the studied cases, i.e. systematic evaluation of the differences and similarities increases the understanding of the complex issues of runoff agriculture under various environmental and socio-economic conditions. The relevance of the models of ancient water-harvesting based systems evolved during the last decades for modern challenges is given special regard. © 2019

AB  - Since ancient times Humans and Soil have experienced interwoven links. Nowadays soil scientists continue to stress such links highlighting the importance of soil in: i) satisfying the ever growing Human demand for food, water and energy, and ii) providing ecosystem services that mitigate climate changes, influence human health and improve biodiversity. Pedotechniques are recently used to generate soils suitable for table grape cultivation in order to increase productivity and grape quality, thus to get substantial financial returns. We show one emblematic study case of pedotechniques applied in Sicily (Italy). Aims of the investigation were: i) stressing threats to soil security derived by the generation of anthropogenic soils, ii) assessing the economic sustainability of pedotechniques and table grape production, taking into consideration only the internal factors and excluding the external economic contributions that are allocated to social sustainability and iii) stressing the role of soil science to focus on “economic value” to the soil ecosystem services and degradation processes. Results highlight that soil transformations allow for considerable investment costs. The highest productivity and the consequent higher profitability of the cultivation amortize the start-up costs. From the other side transformations could trigger considerable deterioration of both soil ecosystem services and environmental quality. In order to stress this last aspect and to define the relationships between pedotechnique application and soil security we have considered the five soil security dimensions (i.e. capability, condition, capital, connectivity and codification). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climatic changes pose serious risks to the rural community’s livelihoods of many developing countries whereas people in mountainous regions are exposed to multiple hazards with limited livelihood resources and heavy dependence on natural resources. The objective of the current study is to assess the livelihood practices and adaptive capacity of a mountainous region of Pakistan, the Balakot, where people are highly vulnerable to climatic changes. The study uses a triangulation method to explore various issues and options of climate change risks sand adaptation and impact of well-being on resilience capacity and livelihood strategies. For this purpose, ten focus group discussions (FGDs) with carefully selected key informants and structured interviews with randomly selected 200 local households are conducted to evaluate different hazards and their associated livelihood effects. It is observed that the changing climate has significantly influenced livelihoods of the local community in the recent past through resource degradation, gradual unavailability of sufficient basic services (quantity and quality of drinking water, crop food diversity, fuel wood, and non-timber forest products), low agricultural productivity, and social inequity viz. income distribution, health, education, and food storage. Such a brunt is felt disproportionately more by poor households due to their low adaptive capacity to climate change with constrained livelihood resources. The study emphasizes the need for targeted efforts to move from coping strategies to adaptations among people considering their social inequalities. Timely information sharing, livelihood diversification and preservation of livelihood resources such as crop and forest production, livestock grazing, creating awareness on the pace, and pattern of climate change in the region and subsequent role of adaptation options are major interventions that should be emphasized by the public bodies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The several changes happening in environmental, social, economic, technological and geopolitical spheres of our society result in countless risks, challenges and opportunities for human development. The global population crosses 7.7 billion with the loss of biodiversity, increasing pressure on food, water, and energy resources. The migration of people from rural to urban in large scale is a matter of concern; as the global urban population will almost reach 68% by 2050, approximately 6 billion. A very high concentration of people living in urban areas and growth projection pose a serious challenge for large cities for vulnerability. Amongst the several challenges, food security will be a serious issue for the future of cities. In this context, the Fourth Industrial Revolution and movement towards creating Smart Cities have to provide solutions and opportunities to deal with those challenges. In this opinion paper, we seek to discuss the future of cities, with a holistic vision of several actions to deal with food security challenges in urban centers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The ever-rising population of the twenty-first century together with the prevailing challenges, such as deteriorating quality of arable land and water, has placed a big challenge for plant breeders to satisfy human needs for food under erratic weather patterns. Rice, wheat, and maize are the major staple crops consumed globally. Drought, waterlogging, heat, salinity, and mineral toxicity are the key abiotic stresses drastically affecting crop yield. Conventional plant breeding approaches towards abiotic stress tolerance have gained success to limited extent, due to the complex (multigenic) nature of these stresses. Progress in breeding climate-resilient crop plants has gained momentum in the last decade, due to improved understanding of the physiochemical and molecular basis of various stresses. A good number of genes have been characterized for adaptation to various stresses. In the era of novel molecular markers, mapping of QTLs has emerged as viable solution for breeding crops tolerant to abiotic stresses. Therefore, molecular breeding-based development and deployment of high-yielding climate-resilient crop cultivars together with climate-smart agricultural practices can pave the path to enhanced crop yields for smallholder farmers in areas vulnerable to the climate change. Advances in fine mapping and expression studies integrated with cheaper prices offer new avenues for the plant breeders engaged in climate-resilient plant breeding, and thereby, hope persists to ensure food security in the era of climate change. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - More than three billion people rely on seafood for nutrition. However, fish are the predominant source of human exposure to methylmercury (MeHg), a potent neurotoxic substance. In the United States, 82% of population-wide exposure to MeHg is from the consumption of marine seafood and almost 40% is from fresh and canned tuna alone1. Around 80% of the inorganic mercury (Hg) that is emitted to the atmosphere from natural and human sources is deposited in the ocean2, where some is converted by microorganisms to MeHg. In predatory fish, environmental MeHg concentrations are amplified by a million times or more. Human exposure to MeHg has been associated with long-term neurocognitive deficits in children that persist into adulthood, with global costs to society that exceed US$20 billion3. The first global treaty on reductions in anthropogenic Hg emissions (the Minamata Convention on Mercury) entered into force in 2017. However, effects of ongoing changes in marine ecosystems on bioaccumulation of MeHg in marine predators that are frequently consumed by humans (for example, tuna, cod and swordfish) have not been considered when setting global policy targets. Here we use more than 30 years of data and ecosystem modelling to show that MeHg concentrations in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) increased by up to 23% between the 1970s and 2000s as a result of dietary shifts initiated by overfishing. Our model also predicts an estimated 56% increase in tissue MeHg concentrations in Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) due to increases in seawater temperature between a low point in 1969 and recent peak levels—which is consistent with 2017 observations. This estimated increase in tissue MeHg exceeds the modelled 22% reduction that was achieved in the late 1990s and 2000s as a result of decreased seawater MeHg concentrations. The recently reported plateau in global anthropogenic Hg emissions4 suggests that ocean warming and fisheries management programmes will be major drivers of future MeHg concentrations in marine predators. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - In the process of urban agglomeration, water-food security can be deemed as a key to support urban development and human living, but which can be challenged by expanded population growth, accelerated industrialization, unbalance regional economic development and diversity of weather (due to climate changes). In this study, a water resources allocation and food production (WF)optimization is developed for regional sustainability under multiple uncertainties. A hybrid two-stage fuzzy programming with Laplace criterion (TSFL)is proposed into a WF optimization to handle hybrid indeterminacies, which can increase the robustness of decision-making. The WF optimization with proposed TSFL method can be applied to a practical case of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH)region. The obtained results associated with water deficits, optimal water allocations, inadequate capacities of food production, rational irrigation schedules, sound livestock scales, optimized agricultural possessing layouts and system benefits under various population-economy regulation scenarios can be obtained. The results can reflect the tradeoff between economic development and water-food safety; meanwhile, they can display risk violation of WF plan under various credibility levels and Laplace criterions (based on TSFL method). All above results can facilitate to produce an optimized water-food plan to support the synergetic development of BTH region in a robust manner. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Brazil's environmental legislation obliges private properties to retain a fixed proportion of their total area with native vegetation, the so-called “Legal Reserves”. Those areas represent practically one third of the country's native vegetation and are well known for their role in biodiversity protection and in the provisioning of a wide range of ecosystem services for landowners and society. Despite their relevance, this instrument has been criticized by part of the agribusiness sector and its representatives in the Brazilian Congress. The Legal Reserve requirement is said to be too restrictive and to impede the full expansion of agricultural activities, and thus to be detrimental for the development of the country. Here, we critically analyze the arguments employed in the justification of a recently proposed bill that aims to completely extinguish Legal Reserves. We demonstrate that the arguments used are mostly unsupported by data, evidence or theory, besides being based on illogical reasoning. Further, we synthesize the principal benefits of Legal Reserves, including health and economic benefits, and emphasize the importance of these reserves for water, energy, food, and climate securities, in addition to their primary function of assisting in the maintenance of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We also highlight that Legal Reserves are a key-component for effective and less expensive nature-based solutions, and thus should be considered as assets for the development of Brazil rather than liabilities. Based on available sound scientific evidence and agreement on their relevance, we strongly oppose any attempt to extinguish or weaken the maintenance of Brazil's Legal Reserves. © 2019

AB  - Changes in stratospheric ozone and climate over the past 40-plus years have altered the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation conditions at the Earth’s surface. Ozone depletion has also contributed to climate change across the Southern Hemisphere. These changes are interacting in complex ways to affect human health, food and water security, and ecosystem services. Many adverse effects of high UV exposure have been avoided thanks to the Montreal Protocol with its Amendments and Adjustments, which have effectively controlled the production and use of ozone-depleting substances. This international treaty has also played an important role in mitigating climate change. Climate change is modifying UV exposure and affecting how people and ecosystems respond to UV; these effects will become more pronounced in the future. The interactions between stratospheric ozone, climate and UV radiation will therefore shift over time; however, the Montreal Protocol will continue to have far-reaching benefits for human well-being and environmental sustainability. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Global freshwater resources have faced critical water security challenges during the 21st century in the world’s river basins. Shortages of water have impaired economic development by disrupting regimes of river flows, ecosystem functioning and food security. Excessive surface and groundwater withdrawals have almost reached the threshold. The current withdrawals of total water (4700 km3·y−1) suggest the imbalance of water use and renewal rates in the world’s river basins. The water security issues are further intensified by phosphate and nitrate pollution from land use and climate change. Today, about 400 million people worldwide experience extreme shortages of water for daily use. Limited availability of water which needs to meet the basic needs of hygiene and sanitation for consumption and other uses has increased competition among users. While the society demands more water-intensive goods and services, the ecosystems are however left behind, consequently leading to increased conflicts and insecurity. Equitable water allocation for people and nature is becoming increasingly urgent. However, understanding the complex interactions between the society and nature in the world’s river basins is limited. This paper aims to unravel some key strategies that enhance future water security through the advancement of science, knowledge and technologies in the world’s river basins. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Several hypotheses invoke climatic variability as a driving force for hominin evolution. Thus, high-resolution records of climate and environmental variability from anthropologically significant locations can help test these hypotheses. Sedimentary sequences recovered by the Olduvai Gorge Coring Project (OGCP) help evaluate climatic and environmental changes at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania through the analyses of various biogeochemical proxies. The stratigraphic sequence of OGCP Core 2A can be correlated with horizons associated with hominins and is chronologically constrained by distinctive dated horizons, such as the Bed I Basalt and Tuff IB. The lacustrine interval from 76.6 to 86.9 m depth is ideally suited for high-resolution analyses of biogeochemical proxies as it is rich in organic carbon (&gt;1%TOC). The hydrogen isotopic composition of nC31 in this interval of OGCP Core 2A records the effects of precession-driven wet-dry cycles on the terrestrial environment that led to alternations between woodland and grassland ecosystems, comparable to those documented by previous investigations of outcrop analogues at Olduvai. Here, we examine stratigraphic variations in the abundance of biomarkers (C28 steradienes, C17 and C23 n-alkanes, C27 and C28 A-norsteranes, fern-8-ene, and chromans) derived from aquatic organisms (algae, cyanobacteria, sponges, macrophytes, etc.) to determine the response of Paleolake Olduvai to climate variability. In general, these aquatic biomarkers reflect the productivity of the lake environment and exhibit the same precession-driven wet-dry cycles recorded by terrestrial biogeochemical signatures. However, they also provide evidence of abrupt (&lt;~300 yr) changes in lake level and corresponding aquatic communities superimposed on the longer-term Milankovitch cycles. Thus, evidence for climatic variability is manifested through the pacing and intensity of changes in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, but the different rates of the responses on land and in the aquatic environment potentially had a complex influence on water and food resources that were important factors for hominin habitation and evolution. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large-scale food system practices have diminished soil and water quality and negatively impacted climate change. Yet, numerous opportunities exist to harness food system practices that will ensure better outcomes for human health and ecosystems. The objective of this study was to consider food Production, Processing, Access and Consumption domains, and for each determine the challenges and successes associated with progressing towards a sustainable food system. A workshop engaging 122 participants including producers, consultants, consumers, educators, funders, scientists, media, government and industry representatives, was conducted in Perth, Western Australia. A thematic analysis of statements (Successes (n = 170) or Challenges (n = 360)) captured, revealed issues of scale, knowledge and education, economics, consumerism, big food, environmental/sustainability, communication, policies and legislation, and technology and innovations. Policy recommendations included greater investment into research in sustainable agriculture (particularly the evidentiary basis for regenerative agriculture), land preservation, and supporting farmers to overcome high infrastructure costs and absorb labour costs. Policy, practice and research recommendations included focusing on an integrated food systems approach with multiple goals, food system actors working collaboratively to reduce challenges and undertaking more research to further the regenerative agriculture evidence. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key hydrologic state variable that is of significant importance for numerous Earth and environmental science applications that directly impact the global environment and human society. Potential applications include, but are not limited to, forecasting of weather and climate variability; prediction and monitoring of drought conditions; management and allocation of water resources; agricultural plant production and alleviation of famine; prevention of natural disasters such as wild fires, landslides, floods, and dust storms; or monitoring of ecosystem response to climate change. Because of the importance and wide-ranging applicability of highly variable spatial and temporal SM information that links the water, energy, and carbon cycles, significant efforts and resources have been devoted in recent years to advance SM measurement and monitoring capabilities from the point to the global scales. This review encompasses recent advances and the state-of-the-art of ground, proximal, and novel SM remote sensing techniques at various spatial and temporal scales and identifies critical future research needs and directions to further advance and optimize technology, analysis and retrieval methods, and the application of SM information to improve the understanding of critical zone moisture dynamics. Despite the impressive progress over the last decade, there are still many opportunities and needs to, for example, improve SM retrieval from remotely sensed optical, thermal, and microwave data and opportunities for novel applications of SM information for water resources management, sustainable environmental development, and food security. ©2019.

AB  - Security of supply of medicines is fundamental to ensure health for all. Furthermore, improving access to medicines is included in sustainable development goal 3. However, the concept of security of supply has mostly been applied to food, water and energy. Diversity of supply, vulnerability to disruption, expenditure, infrastructure, stability of exporting countries, ownership of production, price stability, access and equity, affordability, intellectual property, safety and reliability of supply, and countries’ capacity to adapt to market changes are all elements of security of supply. Based on these elements, we assessed security of supply for insulin, since access to insulin is a global problem. We found that three multinational companies, in Denmark, France and Germany, control 99% of the value of the global insulin market. Prices and affordability of insulin and access to it vary considerably between countries. Some countries are vulnerable to insulin shortage because they import insulin from only one source. Many countries spend large amounts of money on insulin and costs are increasing. Some countries lack an adequate infrastructure for procurement, supply chain management and distribution of insulin. Applying the security of supply concept to insulin showed that diversification of suppliers needs to be fostered. Global health actors should adopt a security of supply approach to identify medicines that are susceptible to supply issues and address this concern by strategic promotion of local production, strengthening regulatory harmonization, and adding local products to the World Health Organization’s programme on prequalification of medicines. © 2019, World Health Organization.

AB  - At the 21st session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, COP21), a voluntary action plan, the ‘4 per 1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate’ was proposed under the Agenda for Action. The Initiative underlines the role of soil organic matter (SOM) in addressing the three-fold challenge of food and nutritional security, adaptation to climate change and mitigation of human-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. It sets an ambitious aspirational target of a 4 per 1000 (i.e. 0.4%) rate of annual increase in global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, with a focus on agricultural lands where farmers would ensure the carbon stewardship of soils, like they manage day-to-day multipurpose production systems in a changing environment. In this paper, the opportunities and challenges for the 4 per 1000 initiative are discussed. We show that the 4 per 1000 target, calculated relative to global top soil SOC stocks, is consistent with literature estimates of the technical potential for SOC sequestration, though the achievable potential is likely to be substantially lower given socio-economic constraints. We calculate that land-based negative emissions from additional SOC sequestration could significantly contribute to reducing the anthropogenic CO2 equivalent emission gap identified from Nationally Determined Contributions pledged by countries to stabilize global warming levels below 2 °C or even 1.5 °C under the Paris agreement on climate. The 4 per 1000 target could be implemented by taking into account differentiated SOC stock baselines, reversing the current trend of huge soil CO2 losses, e.g. from agriculture encroaching peatland soils. We further discuss the potential benefits of SOC stewardship for both degraded and healthy soils along contrasting spatial scales (field, farm, landscape and country) and temporal (year to century) horizons. Last, we present some of the implications relative to non-CO2 GHGs emissions, water and nutrients use as well as co-benefits for crop yields and climate change adaptation. We underline the considerable challenges associated with the non-permanence of SOC stocks and show how the rates of adoption and the duration of improved soil management practices could alter the global impacts of practices under the 4 per 1000 initiative. We conclude that the 4 per 1000 initiative has potential to support multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. It can be regarded as no-regret since increasing SOC in agricultural soils will contribute to food security benefits that will enhance resilience to climate change. However, social, economic and environmental safeguards will be needed to ensure an equitable and sustainable implementation of the 4 per 1000 target. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Trends of environmental change are influencing the behavior of many species across the world, while highly mobile species are disproportionately impacted by climate change and human modification. Here, we investigate the mechanisms behind climate change effects on the reproductive traits of highly mobile, West Australian bird taxa, the forest red-tailed black cockatoo Calyptorhynchus banksii naso (FRTBC). Using a dataset of annual breeding frequency spanning 19 yr, in combination with hydrological, climatological, and remotely sensed data, we modeled the effects of environmental variation on the annual breeding frequency of FRTBCs. We found several significant relationships between annual breeding frequency of FRTBCs and environmental variation. While the model, which included a proxy for the availability of the cockatoo's primary food source and the previous season's rain, explained 49% of annual breeding frequency, there were also direct and indirect effects of heatwaves and forest productivity. Forest red-tailed black cockatoo breeding appears to be linked to the spatiotemporal availability of its primary food sources, the fruit from the tree species, marri Corymbia calophylla and jarrah Eucalyptus marginata. However, Western Australia is experiencing significant climate change, with increases in temperature and declines in rainfall altering the phenologies of these species, while declining rainfall is affecting the vegetation structure of the region. As drought events and temperatures are anticipated to increase over the region, it is expected that the food resources during the breeding season for cockatoos will become increasingly limited in time and space, thus threatening the persistence of this iconic species. This scenario is likely to be representative of many other situations where wide-ranging species rely on patchy food resources in a changing environment. As global biodiversity is increasingly threatened, this study presents timely evidence illustrating how climate change is affecting the persistence of a threatened, mobile species, and what the implications are for mobile species around the world. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Net primary production (NPP) supplies matter, energy, and services to facilitate the sustainable development of human society and ecosystem. The response mechanism of NPP to land use and climate changes is essential for food security and biodiversity conservation but lacks a comprehensive understanding, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. To this end, taking the middle-reaches of the Heihe River Basin (MHRB) as an example, we uncovered the NPP responses to land use and climate changes by integrating multisource data (e.g., MOD17A3 NPP, land use, temperature, and precipitation) and multiple methods. The results showed that (a) land use intensity (LUI) increased, and climate warming and wetting promoted NPP. From 2000 to 2014, the LUI, temperature, and precipitation of MHRB increased by 1.46, 0.58°C, and 15.76 mm, respectively, resulting in an increase of 14.62 gC/m 2 in annual average NPP. (b) The conversion of low-yield cropland to forest and grassland increased NPP. Although the widespread conversion of unused land and grassland to cropland boosted both LUI and NPP, it was not conducive to ecosystem sustainability and stability due to huge water consumption and human-appropriated NPP. Urban sprawl occupied cropland, forest, and grassland and reduced NPP. (c) Increase in temperature and precipitation generally improved NPP. The temperature decreasing &lt;1.2°C also promoted the NPP of hardy vegetation due to the simultaneous precipitation increase. However, warming-induced water stress compromised the NPP in arid sparse grassland and deserts. Cropland had greater NPP and NPP increase than natural vegetation due to the irrigation, fertilizers, and other artificial inputs it received. The decrease in both temperature and precipitation generally reduced NPP, but the NPP in the well-protection or less-disturbance areas still increased slightly. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Multiple global environmental changes (GECs) now under way, including climate change, biodiversity loss, freshwater depletion, tropical deforestation, overexploitation of fisheries, ocean acidification, and soil degradation, have substantial, but still imperfectly understood, implications for human health. Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) make a major contribution to the global burden of disease. Many of the driving forces responsible for GEC also influence NCD risk through a range of mechanisms. This article provides an overview of pathways linking GEC and NCDs, focusing on five pathways: (a) energy, air pollution, and climate change; (b) urbanization; (c) food, nutrition, and agriculture; (d) the deposition of persistent chemicals in the environment; and (e) biodiversity loss.

AB  - Long-term changes in average temperatures, precipitation, and climate variability threaten agricultural production, food security, and the livelihoods of farming communities globally. Whilst adaptation to climate change is necessary to ensure food security and protect livelihoods of poor farmers, mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can lessen the extent of climate change and future needs for adaptation. Many agricultural practices can potentially mitigate GHG emissions without compromising food production. India is the third largest GHG emitter in the world where agriculture is responsible for 18% of total national emissions. India has identified agriculture as one of the priority sectors for GHG emission reduction in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Identification of emission hotspots and cost-effective mitigation options in agriculture can inform the prioritisation of efforts to reduce emissions without compromising food and nutrition security. We adopted a bottom-up approach to analyse GHG emissions using large datasets of India's ‘cost of cultivation survey’ and the ‘19th livestock census’ together with soil, climate and management data for each location. Mitigation measures and associated costs and benefits of adoption, derived from a variety of sources including the literature, stakeholder meetings and expert opinion, were presented in the form of Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC). We estimated that by 2030, business-as-usual GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in India would be 515 Megatonne CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) per year with a technical mitigation potential of 85.5 MtCO2e per year through adoption of various mitigation practices. About 80% of the technical mitigation potential could be achieved by adopting only cost-saving measures. Three mitigation options, i.e. efficient use of fertilizer, zero-tillage and rice-water management, could deliver more than 50% of the total technical abatement potential. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Meeting global food needs in the face of climate change and resource limitation requires innovative approaches to food production. Here, we explore incorporation of new dark food chains into human food systems, drawing inspiration from natural ecosystems, the history of single cell protein, and opportunities for new food production through wastewater treatment, microbial protein production, and aquaculture. The envisioned dark food chains rely upon chemoautotrophy in lieu of photosynthesis, with primary production based upon assimilation of CH 4 and CO 2 by methane- and hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria. The stoichiometry, kinetics, and thermodynamics of these bacteria are evaluated, and opportunities for recycling of carbon, nitrogen, and water are explored. Because these processes do not require light delivery, high volumetric productivities are possible; because they are exothermic, heat is available for downstream protein processing; because the feedstock gases are cheap, existing pipeline infrastructure could facilitate low-cost energy-efficient delivery in urban environments. Potential life-cycle benefits include: a protein alternative to fishmeal; partial decoupling of animal feed from human food; climate change mitigation due to decreased land use for agriculture; efficient local cycling of carbon and nutrients that offsets the need for energy-intensive fertilizers; and production of high value products, such as the prebiotic polyhydroxybutyrate. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study we investigated the spatial-temporal dynamics and trends of vegetation and its association with changes in various hydrological factors in the North China Plain between 2002 and 2016, by combining the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) with precipitation, GRACE gravity satellite terrestrial water storage (TWS), groundwater, and soil moisture. Our results showed that: (1) from 2002 to 2016, the vegetation of the North China Plain exhibited an increasing trend, whereas there was a decreasing trend in the hydrological factors (TWS, soil moisture, groundwater); (2) being mainly covered by crops, the vegetation in the Huanghuai plain area increased during the study period. However, precipitation, TWS, groundwater, and soil moisture all decreased. Over-exploitation of groundwater to irrigate crops is an important measure to ensure food security in the short term; (3) the contrasting trends in the decreasing vegetation coverage, TWS, soil moisture, and groundwater with increasing precipitation over the urban and rural residential areas in the Yanshan-taihang mountains piedmont plain and Ji-lu-yu low lying plain may be a result of influences from intense human activities; (4) the natural forest and grassland ecosystems located in the Shandong hilly agroforestry region were positively correlated with precipitation during the study period, both showing decreasing trends. Results from this research will generate a better understanding of vegetation dynamics in different ecological environments and its response mechanisms to changes of different hydrological factors. This will guide the design of rational water-use strategies for a changing climate and increasing anthropological activities. © 2019 Science Press. All Rights Reserved.

Estuaries are dynamic ecosystems which vary widely in loading of the contaminant methylmercury (MeHg), and in environmental factors which control MeHg exposure to the estuarine foodweb. Inputs of organic carbon and rates of primary production are important influences on MeHg loading and bioaccumulation, and are predicted to increase with changes in climate and land use pressures. To further understand these influences on MeHg levels in estuarine biota, we used a field study approach in sites across different temperature regions, and with varying organic carbon levels. In paired comparisons of sites with high vs. low organic carbon, fish had lower MeHg bioaccumulation factors (normalized to water concentrations) in high carbon sites, particularly subsites with large coastal wetlands and large variability in dissolved organic carbon levels in the water column. Across sites, MeHg level in the water column was strongly tied to dissolved organic carbon, and was the major driver of MeHg concentrations in fish and invertebrates. Higher primary productivity (chlorophyll-a) was associated with increased MeHg partitioning to suspended particulates, but not to the biota. These findings suggest that increased inputs of MeHg and loss of wetlands associated with climate change and anthropogenic land use pressure will increase MeHg concentrations in estuarine food webs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soil is an integral component of the global environmental system which supports the quality and diversity of terrestrial life on Earth. Therefore, it is vital to consider the processes and impacts of soil degradation on society, especially on the provision of environmental goods and services, including food security and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Scientific societies devoted to soil science play significant roles in reducing soil degradation and promoting soil conservation by advancing scientific knowledge, education and environmental sustainability. The ESSC was founded on 4 November 1988, with the aims to: 1. Support research on soil degradation, soil protection and soil and water conservation. 2. Provide a network for the exchange of knowledge about soil degradation processes and soil conservation research and practises. 3. Produce publications on major issues relating to soil degradation and soil and water conservation. 4. Advise regulators and policy-makers on soil issues, especially soil degradation, protection and conservation. The societal challenges that can be addressed through better soil protection, advancing knowledge and scientific approaches to soil protection and sustainable management, mean the ESSC embraces the on-going development, application, review and constructive criticism of highly innovative scientific soil conservation methods. In this context, the ESSC analyses and publicizes the roles and functions of soil in natural and human-modified systems and the functional optimization of soils to ensure sustainable environmental protection. “The thin layer of soil that forms a patchy covering over the continents controls our own existence and that of every other animal of the land” (Rachel Carson (1962) in ‘Silent Spring’). © 2018 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water and Power Press

AB  - Climate change can affect marine and estuarine fish via alterations to their distributions, abundances, sizes, physiology and ecological interactions, threatening the provision of ecosystem goods and services. While we have an emerging understanding of such ecological impacts to fish, we know little about the potential influence of climate change on the provision of nutritional seafood to sustain human populations. In particular, the quantity, quality and/or taste of seafood may be altered by future environmental changes with implications for the economic viability of fisheries. In an orthogonal mesocosm experiment, we tested the influence of near-future ocean warming and acidification on the growth, health and seafood quality of a recreationally and commercially important fish, yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis). The growth of yellowfin bream significantly increased under near-future temperature conditions (but not acidification), with little change in health (blood glucose and haematocrit) or tissue biochemistry and nutritional properties (fatty acids, lipids, macro- and micronutrients, moisture, ash and total N). Yellowfin bream appear to be highly resilient to predicted near-future ocean climate change, which might be facilitated by their wide spatio-temporal distribution across habitats and broad diet. Moreover, an increase in growth, but little change in tissue quality, suggests that near-future ocean conditions will benefit fisheries and fishers that target yellowfin bream. The data reiterate the inherent resilience of yellowfin bream as an evolutionary consequence of their euryhaline status in often environmentally challenging habitats and imply their sustainable and viable fisheries into the future. We contend that widely distributed species that span large geographic areas and habitats can be “climate winners” by being resilient to the negative direct impacts of near-future oceanic and estuarine climate change. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Kelp are main iodine accumulators in the ocean, and their growth and photosynthesis are likely to benefit from elevated seawater CO 2 levels due to ocean acidification. However, there are currently no data on the effects of ocean acidification on iodine metabolism in kelp. As key primary producers in coastal ecosystems worldwide, any change in their iodine metabolism caused by climate change will potentially have important consequences for global geochemical cycles of iodine, including iodine levels of coastal food webs that underpin the nutrition of billions of humans around the world. Here, we found that elevated pCO 2 enhanced growth and increased iodine accumulation not only in the model kelp Saccharina japonica using both short-term laboratory experiment and long-term in situ mesocosms, but also in several other edible and ecologically significant seaweeds using long-term in situ mesocosms. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of S. japonica revealed that most vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase genes involved in iodine efflux during oxidative stress are down-regulated under increasing pCO 2 , suggesting that ocean acidification alleviates oxidative stress in kelp, which might contribute to their enhanced growth. When consumed by abalone (Haliotis discus), elevated iodine concentrations in S. japonica caused increased iodine accumulation in abalone, accompanied by reduced synthesis of thyroid hormones. Thus, our results suggest that kelp will benefit from ocean acidification by a reduction in environmental stress however; iodine levels, in kelp-based coastal food webs will increase, with potential impacts on biogeochemical cycles of iodine in coastal ecosystems. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Farmers in the Indo-Gangetic Plains produce much of the wheat and rice grown in India. However, food production and millions of farm-based livelihoods in this region will continue to be adversely affected by hydro-climatic change and variation, reduced land productivity, and declining groundwater levels. Thus, agricultural adaptations are essential for protecting and improving upon intersecting goals of food security, poverty alleviation, and wellbeing. Household “capital” (e.g., natural, human, financial, physical, and social) is commonly cited as an indicator of livelihood adaptability and innovation. We develop a series of mediated structural equation models to empirically evaluate the validity of capital as a suitable indicator for adaptation and adaptive capacity. These models assess the extent to which household capital mediates the relationship between over 1,000 socio-economically differentiated and randomly selected farm households, and their crop, livestock, and land management adaptations in the states of Haryana and Bihar. Central to our models is a single household capital variable, constructed by aggregating nearly 80 different measurements of households' (i) physical/infrastructural capital, (ii) owned or accessed assets, (iii) livelihood diversity, (iv) ability to reach market or commercialize, (v) access to weather information, and (vi) social capital. We find household capital is a significant predictor in adopting crop, land management, and livestock-related adaptation strategies across both states. Second, and in certain cases, lower castes and less educated households engaged in fewer agricultural adaptations—an outcome mediated by their lower composition of capital. Further, and across almost all contexts, household capital mediated the effect of owning a greater proportion of land, and the higher uptake of agricultural adaptation activities. While improvements in any capital category can improve adoption, we recommend programs that improve (i) access to public and private agricultural infrastructure for lower castes; (ii) education and shared knowledge spaces for less-educated households; and (iii) the availability of low-interest loans and the more efficient legal transfer of land for agriculturalists owning a smaller proportion of their land. Through this novel and large-scale analysis of household data, we provide short-term and immediate recommendations for more equitable agricultural adaptation in this breadbasket region of northern India. © Copyright © 2019 Shah, Wagner, Sanga, Park, Demange, Gueiros and Niles.

AB  - The human diet is characterized by highly energetic molecules, but it also requires non-energetic compounds that are equally useful for cell functioning and for preserving the organism’s health status. These “functional” molecules are represented by a wide variety of plant secondary metabolites, such as terpenoids, vitamins and polyphenols with antioxidant power. Widespread commercial crop varieties often contain scarce levels of functional molecules, because they have been mostly selected for productivity, rather than for the content of secondary metabolites. Different scenarios (global economic situation, foreseeable environmental changes) are pushing farmers to review the use of high yield crops and to focus on the valorization of locally-adapted plants. This renewed interest is strengthened by the growing need of consumers for functional foods with beneficial effects on human health and by the willingness to promote sustainable low-input agricultural practices exploiting local climate, soil, water, and (micro)biota. Here, we want to discuss a specific case study concerning locally-adapted crops in Tuscany (Italy). Analyses of nutraceutical molecules in locally-grown crop varieties (namely tomatoes, sweet cherries and onions) have shown that they are characterized by substantially higher functional molecule contents than commercial varieties. Our goal is to promote the high-throughput study of locally-adapted varieties to understand, in a medium-term perspective, whether the cultivation of such plants is a valuable support for the diet and an adequate local economic resource. Such plants can provide a boost to the regional economy, by diversifying the local crop-market landscape. Moreover, the exploitation of locally-grown plants results in the manufacture of fully-traceable products (from the raw bioresource to the finished product) with a “0 km” concept that minimizes the C footprint. © 2019 Berni, Romi, Cantini, Hausman, Guerriero and Cai.

AB  - The evolution of the concept of the ecosystem approach has heralded innovations in the thinking on, and rules for, the management of natural resources. As it is understood today, the ecosystem approach emerged from the requirements of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)1 and its implementation has been intertwined with that of the CBD. The approach requires integration in the management of the environment and natural resources and eschews an approach which is purely sectoral. Wetlands provide an important lens through which to assess the application of the ecosystem approach to the management of coastal ecosystems. Together with forests, wetlands are the most important, yet most seriously threatened, ecosystems in the world.2 Indeed, the degradation and loss of wetlands is occurring more rapidly than that of forests or any other ecosystem.3 The reason could be that forests have always been viewed as a useful ecosystem, providing the source of trees and related products and serving important functions in society.4 In contrast, the utility of wetlands to society has not always been accepted or appreciated. Indeed, historically, wetlands were viewed as useless areas,5 the utility of which required their conversion to more productive uses such as agriculture. This resulted in wetlands being referred to in certain quarters as ‘wastelands’.6 Part of the reason why the importance of wetlands was not appreciated, and efforts spent only in their conversion to other uses, was the failure to accurately assess and value their economic utility. Decision-makers, developers and land-use planners have long perceived little economic benefit to be gained from conserving wetlands and few economic costs have been attached to their degradation.7 However, over time, the utility and importance of wetlands have been understood, and the international community has responded by making efforts for their conservation.8 Nevertheless, despite developments in the appreciation and valuation of the importance of wetlands and the need for their conservation, they still continue to be degraded and/or lost. Whilst certain pressures on wetlands arise from natural causes (such as droughts which affect community migration patterns), it is human activities that have significantly altered the rate and nature of wetlands change.9 Even today, the rate and scale of wetlands loss and/or degradation10 has continued to increase.11 Wetlands, however, are amongst the most precious natural resources on earth12 and the most productive and valuable ecosystems in the world.13 They have useful attributes and perform important functions for humanity. In terms of functions, wetlands play a key role in hydrological balance. They act as a storage of water supply and regulate the water table through the maintenance and recharge of surface and underground water, supply; discharge of groundwater, and storage of floodwaters in flood plains. Other functions include water purification, control of soil erosion and climate stability.14 Wetlands also serve as habitat for many species. They provide an important reservoir of genetic material and are also a source of rich cultural heritage. In Kenya, as elsewhere, wetlands support livelihoods both directly and indirectly through supporting necessary ecological functions, such as provision of water, waste water treatment, maintenance of hydrological cycles, and prevention of storm damage and erosion. In some places they also serve unique cultural functions. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment carried out between 2002 and 2005 remains the most comprehensive account to date of the state of the world’s ecosystems and the required strategies for their conservation and sustainable use.15 The report is famous for the linkages it demonstrated between ecosystems and human well-being through what it called ecosystem services, which it categorised into provisioning services, regulating services, social services and supporting services.16 Several thematic reports were also prepared in association with the Assessment, one of which focused on marine and coastal ecosystems.17 That report18 highlighted the importance of marine and coastal ecosystems, stating that the services they provide include supply of food, fuel wood, energy resources, natural products, and bioprospecting, shoreline stabilization, flood prevention, storm protection, climate regulation, hydrological services, nutrient regulation, carbon sequestration, detoxification of polluted waters, waste disposal, culture, tourism, and recreation, habitat provision, nutrient cycling, primary productivity, and soil formation.19 Governance of oceans and coasts is best understood as the process for policy making by competent institutions in a system of negotiation between nested governmental institutions at several levels (international, national, regional and local), on the one hand, and market parties and civil society organizations on the other.20 Only an integrated approach can help resolve the governance challenges of the oceans and the coast which: for the most part, have been related to the intensifying nature of human interactions with the oceans and coasts and the inability of governance institutions to adapt. Governance processes have in the past primarily focused on regulating individual sectors, ignoring interactions between sectors and ocean ecosystems. While governance effectiveness varies, based on institutional architecture, often specific to a given place, sociopolitical context, legal and policy regime, ignoring interactions among sectors and their combined impacts on the coastal and marine ecosystems, has placed at risk the heritage, livelihoods, and cultures of coastal communities that rely on healthy marine environments.21 In 2010 Kenya adopted a new Constitutional architecture that places a premium on sustainable development as a key governance imperative and requires public participation in all processes. Based on this development, the present chapter assesses the extent to which Kenya’s legal framework for management of wetlands in the coastal region adopts the ecosystem approach and whether it enhances the conservation and wise use of wetlands and thus aligns to the constitutional dictates of sustainable development. The main argument that the paper advances is that both in law and practice, the move towards ecosystem approach is slow and fledgling. The management approach is still characterised by sector specific focus, governance overlaps and legal gaps. However, the adoption of a ‘green constitution’22 and the incorporation of the ecosystem approach in the National Environment Policy in 2014 provide a basis for sustainable management of wetlands in the Kenyan coast. © Collins Odote, 2019

AB  - Mountains across the globe are unique areas for assessing climate change impacts on biodiversity, glaciers and fresh water supply, food production and overall human well-being. The livelihood and food security of the people inhabiting the mountainous parts of the state of Uttarakhand falling in the central Himalayan region of India largely depend on closely interlinked and climate-sensitive sectors, viz. agriculture, livestock and forestry. Understanding peoples’ perceptions of climate change impacts could help designing and implementation of adaptation strategies at the local level. Traditional knowledge of the farming communities for sustainable use of natural resources is gaining credence in recent times. Here we present an analysis of farmers’ perceptions and traditional knowledge in adapting to climate change impacts on agroecosystems in central Himalaya and suggest mechanism for integration of these in developing appropriate locally nuanced adaptation strategies. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

AB  - Interest in the sustainability of soil resources has been stimulated by increasing concerns that soil is one of the most critical components of the earth’s biosphere, participating in food production and management maintenance of environmental quality. In arid and semiarid regions, oases appear to be a major threat model in the soil component. The palm plantations contribute to the formation of oasis ecosystems by promoting the creation of a suitable microclimate for the development of underlying crops and offsetting the effects of drought. These ecosystems play key roles in multiple socioeconomic and environmental issues. Nevertheless they remain fragile and undergo impacts of human and/or natural origins permanently such as extreme temperatures, soil salinity, drought, erosion, and low contents in organic matter and native fertility. In order to ensure good yields, farmers use an intensive amount of chemical fertilizer, but it can have detrimental effects on soil. In this chapter, we will focus on the improvement of the biomass and yield of different agricultural crops - i.e., cereals (wheat, corn), vegetable crops (lettuce, tomato, leek), leguminous (alfalfa), and trees (date palm) - in field via the enrichment of soil by setting up an efficient biological protocol integrating arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), PGPR, and/or organic soil conditioners resulting from green waste, phosphogypsum, phosphate wash sludge, and agro-industrial poultry waste manure. Our results confirmed the advantages of various biological and organic fertilizers in improving the biomass and yields for different crops. The combination of AMF and compost green waste appeared to be interesting for the improvement of the growth, mineral nutrition, and physiological and water parameters of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.). Furthermore, the combination of low dose (5%, 10%) and indigenous AMF is clearly beneficial for the growth of alfalfa and tomato under a greenhouse. Concerning the experiments carried out in the field, it confirmed the advantages of biological and organic fertilizers in improving the yield for leguminous (alfalfa), vegetable crops (lettuce, tomato, and leek), and cereals (wheat). Application of the tripartite combination AMF-PGPR compost was more efficient in increasing the yield of the tested plants. Indeed, biological treatments had an important effect on the physicochemical properties of the soil. Finally, we have elucidated the positive impacts of biofertilizers used and the interest of adopting the innovative practices improving soil fertility, preserving water resources, respecting the environment and ensuring the development of sustainable organic agriculture. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

AB  - Agriculture today is at crossroads facing challenge of efficient food production due to a growing population burden and a shrinking arable land base and water resources. Current important challenges of agriculture include, but not limited to, food security, sustainability of natural resources, improving nutrient use efficiency, production of nutrient-enriched agriculture for maintaining human health and healthy life, and climate change. In the era of climate change, nanotechnology could be useful in mitigating climate change by trapping C in terrestrial pools. The nanomaterials due to their unique properties at nanoscale are reported to enhance carbon stabilization and its possible sequestration in soil. However, contradictory reports on the potential impact of nanomaterials on soil microorganisms are one of the major reasons to limit the adoption of this technology at large scale for mitigating climate change. Nevertheless, continuous efforts are needed to explore the possibility of nanotechnology in C sequestration without compromising ecosystem productivity for developing a climate smart agriculture. This chapter aimed at highlighting the potential of nanomaterials for improved C management in soil and the future research prospects in nanotechnology research pertaining to soil carbon study. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

AB  - Stress environments hinder the crop growth and development, and under ever-increasing food demand circumstances, concerns of food security have asked for exploring options to overcome such stress conditions. High soluble/exchangeable salt stress referred to as salinity stress resulting from environmental characteristics (i.e., climate and soil parent material) and human-induced factors such as fertilization and irrigation poses serious threats to crop production in saline areas on different extents ranging from low to very high, categorically. This stress affects the plant growth through osmotic stress, which ultimately leads to several physiological disruptions including oxidative stress, nutrient imbalance, and water uptake problems. Subsequently, halophytes gained importance for their accumulation capability leading toward the development of phytoremediation techniques when manipulated through anthropogenic activities. The diversity of halophytes in such conditions offered a huge genetic pool together with wide options for recultivating such saline areas. The variety of halophytic plants also put forward the promising microorganisms associated with such plants helping in ameliorating the stress through various mechanisms, viz., antioxidant and other stress-related exudates production, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase release, chelating agents production, and expression of stress-related genes along with widely understood enhancement of the plant growth through a multitude of processes. Such organisms including bacteria, fungi, and arbuscular mycorrhiza, epiphytic or endophytic, have been reported to enhance the phytoremediation potential of halophytes. Keeping in view the potential of halophytes and associated microbiome, this chapter will focus on genetic and agronomic potential of halophytes and role of allied microorganisms in enhancing the salinity tolerance and assisted phytoremediation of saline soils. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

AB  - Clean, reliable supplies of water are critical to the sustainability and resilience of communities, including water needed for energy and food production, industry, drinking water, and other human and ecological needs. However, water infrastructure and management in the United States are largely optimized for historic conditions—designed and operated to respond to social needs, and past mean and extreme streamflow, which may no longer apply in the future. Temperature, precipitation, ecosystem dynamics, energy and food production, and social systems are all experiencing changes, which cumulatively affect the security of water supply. Here, we examine the impact of these changes in a provisioning basin in the arid Southwest, the San Juan River, which supplies water, food, and energy to the Colorado River and the Rio Grande. Our analysis applies a multi-model framework to examine future climate and water use scenarios. Results demonstrate that the San Juan River basin could experience significant disruptions to water deliveries (−12% to −48% for the drier models) and shortages that exceed manageable thresholds (53% to 73% of water in shorted years), potentially affecting both the local basin as well as other regions that receive water and energy from the San Juan. While water stress metrics vary across the scenarios, results indicate the need for government, industry, and communities to consider options for adapting to water supply shifts. These results raise important questions regarding the resilience of water resources in basins across the West under future scenarios and implications for energy, food, and other water supply needs. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Food loss and waste (FLW) represents a major challenge for food systems sustainability and a growing concern in the political agenda of national governments and international organizations. This interest is primarily driven by the interrelated implications that FLW has with food security, human health, economic development, and ecosystems. The staggering amount of FLW currently generated along supply chains exacerbates global food system challenges, such as world population growth, change of dietary habits, energy intensity of agro-food systems, and food supply vulnerability due to climate change. In a life-cycle perspective, beyond representing a missed opportunity to feed the growing world population, FLW also puts a huge pressure on natural capital, in terms of natural resources consumption (e.g., fossil energy, water, fish stocks, agricultural land), environmental pollution (water, air, soil), GHG emissions, ecosystem resilience, and biodiversity loss. This chapter aims at analyzing food systems sustainability through the lens of the interrelated implications and impacts of FLW on production and consumption. First, it provides an overview of the debate around FLW definition and quantification. Then, it focuses on the causes and impacts of FLW and the related methodological challenges. Additionally, recent policy initiatives are discussed in a comparative perspective. Finally, challenges and future research needs are highlighted. © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Ramsar Convention was agreed in 1971 between 18 nations, and now has contracting parties from all regions of the world. The potential services related to ecosystem and human health primarily cover supply of water, food, nutrition, and medicine, purification of waste products, and buffering against adverse flooding and climate effects. The review shows that the Convention and the Ramsar network of important wetlands (currently 1500 sites of more than 100 million ha) is evidently playing a major role in relation to the provision of these services. However, examples are given showing that the benefits of wetland conservation for human and ecosystem health are often, due to lack of documentation, oversimplified. It is further shown that the Ramsar network in its current form and with the available data and documentation may be inefficient in providing the health services. This relates especially to the underrepresentation of several wetland types, the poor definition of boundaries, evidence of divergences between conservation and environmental protection targets in nutrient-limited coastal waters, assessments of tolerance threshold values for toxic substances for the various types of wetland communities, and the importance of the wetlands in the Ramsar network for groundwater and their flood buffering potential. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Here we present a comprehensive review of the diversity revealed by research in limnology and microbial ecology conducted in Byers Peninsula (Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) during the last two decades. The site constitutes one of the largest ice-free areas within the Antarctic Peninsula region. Since it has a high level of environmental protection, it is less human-impacted compared to other sites within the South Shetland archipelago. The main investigations in Byers Peninsula focused on the physical and chemical limnology of the lakes, ponds, rivers, and wetlands, as well as on the structure of their planktonic and benthic microbial communities, and on the functional ecology of the microbial food webs. Lakes and ponds in Byers range along a productivity gradient that extends from the less productive lakes located upland to the eutrophic coastal lakes. Their planktonic assemblages include viruses, bacteria, a metabolically diverse community of protists (i.e., autotrophs, heterotrophs, and mixotrophs), and a few metazooplankton species. Most of the studies conducted in the site demonstrate the strong influence of the physical environment (i.e., temperature, availability of light, and water) and nutrient availability in structuring these microbial communities. However, top-down biotic processes may occur in summer, when predation by zooplankton can exert a strong influence on the abundance of protists, including flagellates and ciliated protozoa. As a consequence, bacterioplankton could be partly released from the grazing pressure exerted by these protists, and proliferates fueled by external nutrient subsidies from the lake's catchment. As summer temperatures in this region are slightly above the melting point of water, biotic processes, such as those related to the productivity of lakes during ice-free periods, could become even more relevant as warming induced by climate change progresses. The limnological research carried out at the site proves that Byers Peninsula deserves special attention in the framework of the research in extreme environments. Together with nearby sites, such as Signy Island, Byers Peninsula comprises a featuring element of the Maritime Antarctic region that represents a benchmark area relative to the global distribution and diversity of aquatic microorganisms. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - With the world’s population expected to exceed nine billion by 2050, scientists are working to develop new ways to meet rising global demand for food, energy and water without increasing the strain on natural resources. Organisations including the World Bank and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation are calling for more innovation to address the challenges of the agri-food sector. The wide use of synthetic fertilisers has led to negative impacts on the environment and on farmer economies. Innovative cost-effective and eco-compatible strategies are needed in the modern and in the future precision agriculture. This goal could be achieved by reducing the amount of fertilisers applied on crops, in particular, by finding new techniques to distribute the necessary plant nutrients taking into account water and land scarcity, climate change and ecosystems. Nanotechnology is one of six key-enabling technologies that contribute to smart, sustainable competitiveness and inclusive growth in many sectors. It is expected that properly designed nanostructures will allow controlled release of nutrients to synchronise the release with crops nutritional needs. However, the deliberate introduction of nano-sized materials in agricultural activities raises concerns over the possible implications for human health and the environment. The introduction of nanotechnologies in agriculture still need deepen basic and applied knowledge, however several promising results were achieved, so far. The paper presents an overview on the most recent insights and the perspectives of applied research. © the Author(s), 2019 Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.

AB  - This work is intended as a general and concise overview of Ephemeroptera biology, diversity, and services provided to humans and other parts of our global array of freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. The Ephemeroptera, or mayflies, are a small but diverse order of amphinotic insects associated with liquid freshwater worldwide. They are nearly cosmopolitan, except for Antarctica and some very remote islands. The existence of the subimago stage is unique among extant insects. Though the winged stages do not have functional mouthparts or digestive systems, the larval, or nymphal, stages have a variety of feeding approaches—including, but not limited to, collector-gatherers, filterers, scrapers, and active predators—with each supported by a diversity of morphological and behavioral adaptations. Mayflies provide direct and indirect services to humans and other parts of both freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. In terms of cultural services, they have provided inspiration to musicians, poets, and other writers, as well as being the namesakes of various water- and aircraft. They are commemorated by festivals worldwide. Mayflies are especially important to fishing. Mayflies contribute to the provisioning services of ecosystems in that they are utilized as food by human cultures worldwide (having one of the highest protein contents of any edible insect), as laboratory organisms, and as a potential source of antitumor molecules. They provide regulatory services through their cleaning of freshwater. They provide many essential supporting services for ecosystems such as bioturbation, bioirrigation, decomposition, nutrition for many kinds of non-human animals, nutrient cycling and spiraling in freshwaters, nutrient cycling between aquatic and terrestrial systems, habitat for other organisms, and serving as indicators of ecosystem health. About 20% of mayfly species worldwide might have a threatened conservation status due to influences from pollution, invasive alien species, habitat loss and degradation, and climate change. Even mitigation of negative influences has benefits and tradeo_s, as, in several cases, sustainable energy production negatively impacts mayflies. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Land degradation has become one of the major environmental issues that threaten the well-being of the world's 3.2 billion people. In recent years, it has received extensive attention from the United Nations (UN), the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and so on. However, existing land degradation studies still suffer by unclear concepts, ambiguous processes and mechanisms, and incomplete understanding of impacts. Thus, clarifying the process and mechanism of land degradation is the key to preventing further land degradation and restoring degraded land. Based on the thematic assessment of the IPBES, the present study reviewed the concept, process, mechanisms as well as impacts of land degradation. The process of land degradation is driven by two factors: the natural environment and anthropogenic activities. In land degradation process, there are six land degradation states; namely, the appearance of degradation, degraded in the past, susceptible to degradation, land recovers when stressors are removed, temporal trend of increase in degradation, and stable degraded state. Land degradation can be divided into urban land degradation, cropland degradation, forest and grassland degradation, wetland degradation, and other types of land degradation based on land use types. Land degradation can threaten food and water security, reduce biodiversity and ecosystem services, trigger regional conflicts, mass migration, and disease transmission, exacerbate poverty and global climate change. The review of the land degradation process, mechanism, and impacts will provide theoretical guidance for in-depth study of land degradation, such as desertification and rocky desertification in China, and provide decision support for overall planning of governance of the mountain, water, forest, cropland, lake, and grass systems, supporting the construction of a Beautiful China and Eco-civilization. © 2019 Science Press.

AB  - As the number of human individuals increases on a planet of invariable size and measures, the ecological conditions vary to a corresponding extent. Quite a number of biotic and abiotic factors are a matter of daily news as well as of current scientific discussions. In this contribution, eleven ecological fields concerning human life are analysed: • area available with respect to various competing utilisations, • fresh water needed as drinking water, for industrial processes and for irrigation as well as for other human purposes, • food production, nutrition and related aspects, • required fossil and regenerative energies, • atmosphere and climate, • marine ecology and fisheries, • human waste and ecological aftereffects, • the ecological functions of forests for human life, • biodiversity, • the Ecological Footprint, and • the development of human population increase. As the very characteristic of the ecological network, almost all these factors interact in obvious or clandestine ways. In the given frame of this article, the manifold interchanging influences are discussed, and consequences for a sustainable human life are drawn. © 2018 E.

AB  - The European Commission has recognized nanotechnologies as extremely promising for increasing competitiveness of different sectors of the economy. On account of climate changes and the quest for food security, they are an effective way of solving key problems in the agrarian sector. Nowadays nanotechnologies are widely used for creating nanofertilizers, nanoinsecticides, nanofungicides, nanoherbicides and other nanopreparations. Numerous researches affirm advantages of nanopreparations, which has helped them find a wide use in agricultural practice. At the same time, nanopreparations are the source of entry into the environment of nanoparticles (size less than 100 nm) which are characterized by large active surface and specific physical-chemical properties different from ordinary chemical substances. It is precisely this which determines their bioaccessibility, bioaccumulation and toxicity. Recently, data about toxicity of nanoparticles for human and natural ecosystems have been accumulated. The results of a great deal of research affirm that they break the processes of photosynthesis, transpiration, mitosis, miosis and have a negative influence on colouring agents, proteins and carbohydrates. Under their action, physiological processes of plant growth and development are disturbed, which take place mainly in root system. Nanoparticles are characterized by high bioaccessibility for soil organisms, they are toxic to earthworms and microorganisms and they influence circulation of carbon and nitrogen. Aquatic organisms have been shown to have high sensitivity to nanoparticles; toxic effect has been registered for fish, daphnids, water plants and microorganisms. Taking into consideration the high level of potential danger of nanopreparations used in crop cultivation, special notice should be paid to the development of eco toxicological research. At present, nanoecotoxicological approaches to assessment of the danger of nanomaterials and nanoparticles are absent. Development of reports on elaboration of quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis, and methods of modeling and prognostication of risks is only at the initial stage. The objective of this review is attracting attention to solving the problem of nanoecotoxicology, nanoagrochemicals and nanopesticides, which needs consolidated efforts of scientists, governmental organizations and business and is an obligatory condition for preventing the negative impact of nanomaterials on humans and the environment. © 2019 Oles Honchar Dnipro National University.

AB  - The role of soil in the existential environmental problems of declining biodiversity, climate change, water and energy security, impacting on food security has highlighted the need to link the soil functions to ecosystem services. We describe and illustrate by a limited example, the concepts and assessment of soil's capacity measured through its capability and condition as contributors to an overall soil security framework. The framework is based on the concepts of genosoils and phenosoils. The links to other notions, such as threats to soil and soil functions are made. The framework can be potentially applied elsewhere to quantify soil changes under natural processes and human activities. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is a fundamental physical variable for understanding, quantifying and predicting complex interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere. Such processes determine how heat from the sun is redistributed across the global oceans, directly impacting large- and small-scale weather and climate patterns. The provision of daily maps of global SST for operational systems, climate modelling and the broader scientific community is now a mature and sustained service coordinated by the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) and the CEOS SST Virtual Constellation (CEOS SST-VC). Data streams are shared, indexed, processed, quality controlled, analyzed, and documented within a Regional/Global Task Sharing (R/GTS) framework, which is implemented internationally in a distributed manner. Products rely on a combination of low-Earth orbit infrared and microwave satellite imagery, geostationary orbit infrared satellite imagery, and in situ data from moored and drifting buoys, Argo floats, and a suite of independent, fully characterized and traceable in situ measurements for product validation (Fiducial Reference Measurements, FRM). Research and development continues to tackle problems such as instrument calibration, algorithm development, diurnal variability, derivation of high-quality skin and depth temperatures, and areas of specific interest such as the high latitudes and coastal areas. In this white paper, we review progress versus the challenges we set out 10 years ago in a previous paper, highlight remaining and new research and development challenges for the next 10 years (such as the need for sustained continuity of passive microwave SST using a 6.9 GHz channel), and conclude with needs to achieve an integrated global high-resolution SST observing system, with focus on satellite observations exploited in conjunction with in situ SSTs. The paper directly relates to the theme of Data Information Systems and also contributes to Ocean Observing Governance and Ocean Technology and Networks within the OceanObs2019 objectives. Applications of SST contribute to all the seven societal benefits, covering Discovery; Ecosystem Health & Biodiversity; Climate Variability & Change; Water, Food, & Energy Security; Pollution & Human Health; Hazards and Maritime Safety; and the Blue Economy. © 2019 O'Carroll, Armstrong, Beggs, Bouali, Casey, Corlett, Dash, Donlon, Gentemann, Høyer, Ignatov, Kabobah, Kachi, Kurihara, Karagali, Maturi, Merchant, Marullo, Minnett, Pennybacker, ramakrishnan, Ramsankaran, Santoleri, Sunder, Saux Picart, Vázquez-Cuervo and Wimmer.

AB  - The mountain cryosphere provides fresh water and other ecosystem services to half of humanity. The loss of the mountain cryosphere due to global warming is already evident in many parts of the world and has direct implications to people living in mountain areas and indirect implications to those who live downstream of glaciated river basins. Despite the growing concerns, the relationship between cryosphere change and human society has yet to be assessed systematically. A better understanding of how cryosphere change affects human systems and human security would provide much needed support to the planning of global and regional actions to mitigate impacts and facilitate adaptation. This paper synthesizes the current evidence for and potential impacts of cryosphere change on water, energy, food, and the environment in different mountain regions in the world. The analysis reveals that the changes in the cryosphere and the associated environmental change have already impacted people living in high mountain areas and are likely to introduce new challenges for water, energy, and food security and to exacerbate ecosystem and environmental degradation in the future. The effects of cryospheric changes are also likely to extend to downstream river basins where glacier melt contributes significantly to dry season river flows and supports irrigation, fisheries, and navigation, as well as water supply to many big cities. Appropriate adaptive and mitigative measures are needed to prevent risks and uncertainties from being further compounded. © 2019 Rasul and Molden.

AB  - Being one of the most important habitats for waterbirds, China's West Songnen Plain has experienced substantial damage to its ecosystem, especially the loss and degradation of wetlands and grasslands due to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change. These occurrences have led to an obvious decrease in waterbird species and overall population size. Periodic and timely monitoring of changes in habitat suitability and understanding the potential driving factors for waterbirds are essential for maintaining regional ecological security. In this study, land cover changes from 2000 to 2015 in this eco-sensitive plain were examined using Landsat images and an object-based classification method. Four groups of environmental factors, including human disturbance, water situation, food availability, and shelter safety, characterized by remote sensing data were selected to develop a habitat suitability index (HSI) for assessing habitat suitability for waterbirds. HSI was further classified into four grades (optimum, good, general, and poor), and their spatiotemporal patterns were documented from 2000 to 2015. Our results revealed that cropland expansion and wetland shrinkage were the dominant land cover changes. Waterbird habitat areas in the optimum grade experienced a sharp decline by 7195 km2. The habitat area in good suitability experienced reduction at a change rate of -8.64%, from38,672 km2 to 35,331 km2. In addition, waterbird habitats in the general and poor grades increased overall by 10.31%. More specifically, the total habitat areas with optimum suitable grade, in five national nature reserves over the study region, decreased by 12.21%, while habitat areas with poor suitable grade increased by 3.89%. Changes in habitat suitability could be largely attributed to the increase in human disturbance, including agricultural cultivation from wetlands and grasslands and the expansion of built-up lands. Our findings indicate that additional attention should be directed towards reducing human impact on habitat suitability for sustainable ecosystems. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This assessment summarises the current state of knowledge on the interactive effects of ozone depletion and climate change on aquatic ecosystems, focusing on how these affect exposures to UV radiation in both inland and oceanic waters. The ways in which stratospheric ozone depletion is directly altering climate in the southern hemisphere and the consequent extensive effects on aquatic ecosystems are also addressed. The primary objective is to synthesise novel findings over the past four years in the context of the existing understanding of ecosystem response to UV radiation and the interactive effects of climate change. If it were not for the Montreal Protocol, stratospheric ozone depletion would have led to high levels of exposure to solar UV radiation with much stronger negative effects on all trophic levels in aquatic ecosystems than currently experienced in both inland and oceanic waters. This “world avoided” scenario that has curtailed ozone depletion, means that climate change and other environmental variables will play the primary role in regulating the exposure of aquatic organisms to solar UV radiation. Reductions in the thickness and duration of snow and ice cover are increasing the levels of exposure of aquatic organisms to UV radiation. Climate change was also expected to increase exposure by causing shallow mixed layers, but new data show deepening in some regions and shoaling in others. In contrast, climate-change related increases in heavy precipitation and melting of glaciers and permafrost are increasing the concentration and colour of UV-absorbing dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulates. This is leading to the “browning” of many inland and coastal waters, with consequent loss of the valuable ecosystem service in which solar UV radiation disinfects surface waters of parasites and pathogens. Many organisms can reduce damage due to exposure to UV radiation through behavioural avoidance, photoprotection, and photoenzymatic repair, but meta-analyses continue to confirm negative effects of UV radiation across all trophic levels. Modeling studies estimating photoinhibition of primary production in parts of the Pacific Ocean have demonstrated that the UV radiation component of sunlight leads to a 20% decrease in estimates of primary productivity. Exposure to UV radiation can also lead to positive effects on some organisms by damaging less UV-tolerant predators, competitors, and pathogens. UV radiation also contributes to the formation of microplastic pollutants and interacts with artificial sunscreens and other pollutants with adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. Exposure to UV-B radiation can decrease the toxicity of some pollutants such as methyl mercury (due to its role in demethylation) but increase the toxicity of other pollutants such as some pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Feeding on microplastics by zooplankton can lead to bioaccumulation in fish. Microplastics are found in up to 20% of fish marketed for human consumption, potentially threatening food security. Depletion of stratospheric ozone has altered climate in the southern hemisphere in ways that have increased oceanic productivity and consequently the growth, survival and reproduction of many sea birds and mammals. In contrast, warmer sea surface temperatures related to these climate shifts are also correlated with declines in both kelp beds in Tasmania and corals in Brazil. This assessment demonstrates that knowledge of the interactive effects of ozone depletion, UV radiation, and climate change factors on aquatic ecosystems has advanced considerably over the past four years and confirms the importance of considering synergies between environmental factors. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is going through rapid reorganization due to anthropogenic influences. Understanding how biogeochemical transformation and erosion-induced SOC redistribution influence SOC profiles and stocks is critical to our food security and adaptation to climate change. The important roles of erosion and deposition on SOC dynamics have drawn increasing attention in the past decades, but quantifying such dynamics is still challenging. Here we develop a process-based quasi 3-D model that couples surface runoff, soil moisture dynamics, biogeochemical transformation, and landscape evolution. We apply this model to a subcatchment in Iowa to understand how natural forcing and farming practices affect the SOC dynamics in the critical zone. The net soil thickness and SOC stock change rates are −0.336 (mm/yr) and −1.9 (g C/m 2 /year), respectively. Our model shows that in a fast transport landscape, SOC transport is the dominant control on SOC dynamics compared to biogeochemical transformation. The SOC profiles have “noses” below the surface at depositional sites, which are consistent with cores sampled at the same site. Generally, erosional sites are local net atmospheric carbon sinks and vice versa for depositional sites, but exceptions exist as seen in the simulation results. Furthermore, the mechanical soil mixing arising from tillage enhances SOC stock at erosional sites and reduces it at depositional ones. This study not only helps us understand the evolution of SOC stock and profiles in a watershed but can also serve as an instrument to develop practical means for protecting carbon loss due to human activities. ©2018.

AB  - Interest in larval source management (LSM) as an adjunct intervention to control and eliminate malaria transmission has recently increased mainly because long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spray (IRS) are ineffective against exophagic and exophilic mosquitoes. In Amazonian Peru, the identification of the most productive, positive water bodies would increase the impact of targeted mosquito control on aquatic life stages. The present study explores the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) for identifying Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi) breeding sites with high-resolution imagery (~0.02m/pixel) and their multispectral profile in Amazonian Peru. Our results show that high-resolution multispectral imagery can discriminate a profile of water bodies where Ny. darlingi is most likely to breed (overall accuracy 86.73%- 96.98%) with a moderate differentiation of spectral bands. This work provides proof-of-concept of the use of high-resolution images to detect malaria vector breeding sites in Amazonian Peru and such innovative methodology could be crucial for LSM malaria integrated interventions. © 2019 Carrasco-Escobar et al.

AB  - Droughts and heatwaves cause agricultural loss, forest mortality, and drinking water scarcity, especially when they occur simultaneously as combined events. Their predicted increase in recurrence and intensity poses serious threats to future food security. Still today, the knowledge of how droughts and heatwaves start and evolve remains limited, and so does our understanding of how climate change may affect them. Droughts and heatwaves have been suggested to intensify and propagate via land–atmosphere feedbacks. However, a global capacity to observe these processes is still lacking, and climate and forecast models are immature when it comes to representing the influences of land on temperature and rainfall. Key open questions remain in our goal to uncover the real importance of these feedbacks: What is the impact of the extreme meteorological conditions on ecosystem evaporation? How do these anomalies regulate the atmospheric boundary layer state (event self-intensification) and contribute to the inflow of heat and moisture to other regions (event self-propagation)? Can this knowledge on the role of land feedbacks, when available, be exploited to develop geo-engineering mitigation strategies that prevent these events from aggravating during their early stages? The goal of our perspective is not to present a convincing answer to these questions, but to assess the scientific progress to date, while highlighting new and innovative avenues to keep advancing our understanding in the future. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Land cover and land cover changes affect the environment in such ways that they can influence the human health by changing the climate, weather, water, air, biodiversity, wildlife, disease risk and food security. Comparing aerial or satellite images from the same region recorded at different times, known as post-classification comparison, is an approach that aims to identify changes in land coverage and understand forest spatial pattern change over time. These patterns are extremely complex, therefore, for their description and understanding a better approach would be multifractal geometry. In this paper, by using the multifractal analysis the evolution of the forest spatial model in southern Moldova over a decade has been investigated. We explored the potential of aerial image processing, lacunarity and textural analysis to detect a correlation between lacunarity, fractal dimensions and coverage crowns areas. This analysis leads to the determination of the percentage of land coverage, the dynamics of the natural reforestation process, the location of mature trees and the determination of areas where the landscape has changed drastically due to deforestation and / or reforestation. Two opposite forest spatial patterns were identified. For four studied forests, the rate of deforestation was continuously increased between 2005 and 2010. For only one forest, the Valeni forest, the coverage crown area has increased over the analyzed time period. © 2019 Carpathian Journal of Earth and Environmental Sciences.

AB  - A climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessment was conducted in Dominica, a Caribbean small island developing state located in the Lesser Antilles. The assessment revealed that the country’s population is already experiencing many impacts on health and health systems from climate variability and change. Infectious diseases as well as food and waterborne diseases pose continued threats as climate change may exacerbate the related health risks. Threats to food security were also identified, with particular concern for food production systems. The findings of the assessment included near-term and long-term adaptation options that can inform actions of health sector decision-makers in addressing health vulnerabilities and building resilience to climate change. Key challenges include the need for enhanced financial and human resources to build awareness of key health risks and increase adaptive capacity. Other small island developing states interested in pursuing a vulnerability and adaptation assessment may find this assessment approach, key findings, analysis, and lessons learned useful. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - It is the position of the Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior that environmental sustainability should be inherent in dietary guidance, whether working with individuals or groups about their dietary choices or in setting national dietary guidance. Improving the nutritional health of a population is a long-term goal that requires ensuring the long-term sustainability of the food system. Current environmental trends, including those related to climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation, water shortages, and water pollution, threaten long-term food security and are caused in part by current diets and agricultural practices. Addressing these problems while producing more food for a growing population will require changes to current food systems. Dietary choices have a significant role in contributing to environmental impacts, which could be lessened by consuming fewer overconsumed animal products and more plant-based foods while reducing excess energy intake and the amount of food wasted. Discussion of sustainability within governmental dietary guidance is common in many countries, is consistent with previous US guidelines, and is within the scope of authorizing legislation. Dietary choices are a personal matter, but many American consumers are motivated by a concern for the environment and would welcome sound advice from credentialed nutrition professionals. More opportunities are needed for developing such interdisciplinary knowledge among nutritionists. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - This study analyses forest reference level in terms of loss, gain and transitions among forest, cocoa agroforestry, cassava, maize, settlement and others in the Kloto district (Togo) for REDD+ and sustainable forest and agriculture. The pixel-based classification was adopted and combined with the extended change matrix quantity and intensity analysis using 32-year (1985–2017) Landsat data and land use information from land owners and farmers. Results indicate an active forest loss (19.5%) with dormant gain (0.8%). Forest is involved in most transitions as the most targeted category with the largest transition being a forest to cocoa agroforestry while the avoiding transition was from forest, cocoa agroforestry, maize, cassava and settlement to unclassified classes (e.g. road, water body) and vice versa. Other targeting categories were from forest to settlement, cassava and maize Thus, both cash and food crops are major contributors of forest loss. The study concludes that cropland land degradation is the main reason that explains the significant conversion of forest lands to stable agricultural lands. Therefore, review of the existing cropping and farming systems by promoting agroecology systems (e.g. agroforestry, rotational cropping, mixing cropping with pulses) to sustain and restore soil degradation while mitigating climate change, forest degradation and provide food security for the rural communities is recommended. Economic measures such as: trade-off compensations for agroecology practices and afforestation and reforestation through farmer's association initiatives could be encouraged to limit forest extensions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Earth is undergoing inevitable changes in its climate as a result of both natural and man-made activities, e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes, rapid urbanization, population growth, agricultural intensification, etc. Women commonly face higher risks and greater burdens from the impacts of climate change as they are more likely to be economically dependent than men and have less access to education and information that would allow them to manage climate-related risks to agriculture and livestock. Women make up the majority of the world’s poor population. They tend to suffer more from the impacts of climate-related disasters and severe weather events due to regional cultural norms and unfair distribution of roles, resources, and power, especially in developing countries. Their role in combating climate change is seldom appreciated even though they give priority to their families even in the times of droughts and scarcity of food and water resources. This paper sheds light on climate change and its relation to women in different scenarios of the changing climate. These include agriculture, biodiversity, water, natural disasters, wars, migration, pollution, health and sanitation, education, disempowerment, security, social and psychological and human rights. Lastly, to mitigate the effects of climate change on women, recommendations to involve international funding organizations are also discussed. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Agriculture being a climate-sensitive sector also a sector that provides livelihood for more than 60% of Indians. It is amongst the most vulnerable sectors to the risks and impacts of global climate change, therefore over the past decade a large number of studies have tried to assess the impact of climate variability and climate change. Climate change has often been described as "one of the most pressing environmental challenges". It is a growing global problem and concern, calling for concerted efforts by the developed as well as developing countries. Climate change scenarios include higher temperatures, changes in precipitation, and higher atmospheric CO, concentrations which may affect on yield (both quality and quantity), growth rates, photosynthesis and transpiration rates, moisture availability, through changes of water use (irrigation) and agricultural inputs such as herbicides, insecticides and fertilizers etc. Environmental effects such as frequency and Intensity of soil drainage (leading to nitrogen leaching), soil erosion, land availability, reduction of crop diversity may also affect agricultural productivity. All these changes can influence human health, cause changes to forests and other ecosystems, or even impact our energy supply. Impact of climate change on agriculture will be one of the major deciding factors influencing the future food security of mankind on the earth. Agriculture is not only sensitive to climate change but at the same time is one of the major drivers for climate change. This article reviews the existing literature that assesses the impact of climate change on agriculture and how it affects the agricultural production. This paper is also focusing on the potential roles of adaptation and mitigation strategies and their interactions, in response to climate change to improve agriculture sector in India. © 2018 Ecological Society of India.

AB  - A major problem facing humanity is that our numbers are growing but the availability of land and fresh water for agriculture is not. This problem is being exacerbated by climate change-induced increases in drought, and other abiotic stresses. Stress-resistant crops are needed to ensure yield stability under stress conditions and to minimize the environmental impacts of crop production. Evolution has created thousands of species of naturally stress-resistant plants (NSRPs), some of which have already been subjected to human domestication and are considered minor crops. Broader cultivation of these minor crops will diversify plant agriculture and the human diet, and will therefore help improve global food security and human health. More research should be directed toward understanding and utilizing NSRPs. Technologies are now available that will enable researchers to rapidly improve the genetics of NSRPs, with the goal of increasing NSRP productivity while retaining NSRP stress resistance and nutritional value. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

The imminent risks stemmed from climate change appeal for a greater effort in an overhaul of the customary practices in the planning and management of the urban systems. Urban centers should accommodate the growing need for green infrastructure and edible landscape; options such as farming alternative has gained interest as a possible solution to the urban-scape and the food production stability for the urban inhabitants. This article presents the systemic approach to building integrated agriculture unit prototype's design thinking and proposed a prototype model allowing the locality and place to be incorporated into the design framework. The research concludes that: (1) in line with human-nature connection and raising its priority level within both design research and design practice should consider the environmental, social, economic and spatial criteria for the design thinking exploration; (2) the design results in a flexible system model of the micro building integrated agriculture unit, allowing the units to fit either indoor or outdoor, as a probable solution suited for the locality and the increasing demand for edible greens; (3) indoor units need further study in integration with the indoor climate control and automation as well as added indoor air purification and sensor functions. (4) Prototype units should be capable of providing locally available edible production and social well-being for the urban system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Food insecurity and malnutrition are key policy priorities in India. Evidence on children's experiences of household food insecurity and how food insecurity influences their dietary quality is limited for India and other low- and middle-income countries. Evidence on mid-childhood and adolescence is even scarcer. We present longitudinal evidence on household food insecurity and child diets by drawing on a mixed methods study with two cohorts of children from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (India). Analysis of survey data shows that children living in food insecure households had lower dietary diversity and probability of consumption of micronutrient- and protein-rich foods, which are critical for their healthy development. Inequalities in child dietary quality by household food security status were most pronounced at preschool age. Children identified dietary quality as a critical dimension of their well-being. From an early age, children were able to describe and explain the food security challenges of their families and recognize the negative consequences of household food insecurity on their diets, health and education. Children were not only cognizant of household responses to food insecurity, but they were also actively involved in such strategies through limiting the quantity and quality of food purchased and consumed, reducing dietary diversity, and/or engaging in work or social protection. The latter were often mentioned as critical safety nets in face of economic, demographic or climate shocks, although children expressed criticism about implementation. Longitudinal mixed methods can enhance our understanding of children's experiences of household food insecurity and its repercussion on their health and broader well-being. Child-focused evidence is key to shaping social protection implementation to context-specific needs at critical human development stages. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate change is a complex and cross-cutting problem that needs an integrated and transformative systems approach to respond to the challenge. Current sectoral approaches to climate change adaptation initiatives often create imbalances and retard sustainable development. Regional and international literature on climate change adaptation opportunities and challenges applicable to southern Africa from a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus perspective was reviewed. Specifically, this review highlights climate change impacts on water, energy, and food resources in southern Africa, while exploring mitigation and adaptation opportunities. The review further recommends strategies to develop cross-sectoral sustainable measures aimed at building resilient communities. Regional WEF nexus related institutions and legal frameworks were also reviewed to relate the WEF nexus to policy. Southern Africa is witnessing an increased frequency and intensity in climate change-associated extreme weather events, causing water, food, and energy insecurity. A projected reduction of 20% in annual rainfall by 2080 in southern Africa will only increase the regional socio-economic challenges. This is exacerbating regional resource scarcities and vulnerabilities. It will also have direct and indirect impacts on nutrition, human well-being, and health. Reduced agricultural production, lack of access to clean water, sanitation, and clean, sustainable energy are the major areas of concern. The region is already experiencing an upsurge of vector borne diseases (malaria and dengue fever), and water and food-borne diseases (cholera and diarrhoea). What is clear is that climate change impacts are cross-sectoral and multidimensional, and therefore require cross-sectoral mitigation and adaptation approaches. In this regard, a well-coordinated and integrated WEF nexus approach offers opportunities to build resilient systems, harmonise interventions, and mitigate trade-offs and hence improve sustainability. This would be achieved through greater resource mobilisation and coordination, policy convergence across sectors, and targeting nexus points in the landscape. The WEF nexus approach has potential to increase the resilience of marginalised communities in southern Africa by contributing towards attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 13). © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - There are 535 members of Congress, and only two of them are trained research scientists. Yet the greatest threats the United States and the world face today require science to solve them. Climate change, infectious disease, food and water security, loss of biodiversity, environmental degradation, energy shortages, terrorism, social inequality, the list goes on. What you may not realize is that science and scientific evidence is not necessarily informing the policies and programs that combat these threats. In this Perspective, I take you through my own professional path, from graduate student to senior policy advisor in former President Barack Obama's Office of Science and Technology Policy. I attempt to illustrate that scientific training can (and should) be applied to a diversity of careers, including my own in science policy, and international diplomacy. © 2018 Rao.

AB  - Some of the largest climate changes on Earth are projected for high-latitude polar and subpolar environments in the coming decades (IPCC, 2014). A number of simultaneous socio-environmental perturbations are affecting Patagonia (41-55°S), a vast and complex ecosystem whose economic and societal well-being depends on coastal resources (~80% of people live near-shore; the coastal economy provides > 40,000 jobs). In this new scenario, overlapping natural variability (interannual - seasonal dynamics) and human-induced environmental changes (global change) are major drivers influencing the marine food web structure and functions. Evidence of large environmental changes has been detected in the Patagonia marine system through (a) regional-scale, climatic-oceanographic coupled anomalous events, (b) interannual hydrological changes (decreasing pattern) in freshwater river inputs (watersheds into fjords), and (c) more frequent coastal and oceanic microbial outbreaks (Harmful Algal Blooms). Those changes have highly uncertain effects for the basic functionalities, structure, and feedback responses of coastal systems and their coupling with hydrological (e.g., river streamflow) or biogeochemical (e.g., biological carbon pump) processes. The northern Patagonian fjords system is hypothesized to act as an indicator of large-scale climate change given strong environmental variability. This, combined with regional climatic-oceanographic events (e.g., El Niño Southern Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode) and effects of local anthropogenic activities (e.g., nutrient fluxes from extensive aquaculture, land change due to forestry) may impact the chemical and physical properties of the surface water, destabilizing biological productivity and chemical coastal processes. The present synthesis, which gives the results of systemic-sensitive chemical and biological variables, may be useful to managers and in preventing socio-environmental impacts from increasing natural and anthropogenic phenomena in Chile's southern coastal system. © 2018 Iriarte.

AB  - The people of Oceania have long relied on the ocean for sustenance, commerce, and cultural identity, which promulgated a sophisticated understanding of the marine environment and its conservation. Global declines in ocean health now require innovative solutions that can benefit from customary knowledge and practices, which in the past led to sustainable marine resource use. The resurgence of local stewardship, which incorporates customary practices and governance, has shown promise in many locations throughout the Pacific, although a complete return to past practices is not fully implementable owing to the loss of traditional knowledge, centralized governmental structures, economic development, and globalization. Hybrid systems that incorporate elements of customary and contemporary management can overcome some of these limitations to implementation of successful local management, and lead to greater food security, social cohesion, and the creation of an adaptive system that can potentially mitigate the effects of climate change and other stressors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Water is vital not only for food, energy and sanitation but also for ecosystem functioning, human health, socio-economic progress and poverty reduction. Water security exists when all people have physical and economical access to sufficient, safe, and clean water that meets basic needs. However, water security is threatened by growing human population, episodic environmental disasters, indiscriminate land management practices, contaminants, and escalation in geopolitical conflicts. <3% of the estimated 1.4 billion cubic kilometers of water on earth is available for consumption. Although there exist a range of laboratory and field methods for measuring the chemical, physical and biological properties of water, the information available to the public remains inconsistent and patchy. To this end, we advance a new theory of a single-value objective water quality index (WQI) that considers the interaction between the above properties, to provide concise information for source water quality surveillance and monitoring. Although geospatial technologies such as remote sensing is credited as a high frequency spatiotemporal mapping tool, exiguous information is available on its application for constructing single-value WQIs. Besides, no remote sensing device exists that directly measures water quality, which must indirectly be inferred through modeling sensed remote sensing signals with measured water properties. This review not only highlights the water security conundrum but also provides an overview of methods for integrating geolocated qualitative (e.g., management data) with quantitative (i.e., measured water constituent properties) into a WQI. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are of global importance for maintaining high levels of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and for the number of livelihoods dependent on them. In Bangladesh, coastal and delta communities rely on these systems for a livelihood, and the sustainability of the productivity is seriously threatened by both climate change and unsustainable management. These multiple drivers of change shape the livelihood dependence and adaptation responses, where a better understanding is needed to achieve sustainable management in these systems, while maintaining and improving dependent livelihoods. This need has been addressed in this study in the region of Satkhira, in the southwest coast of Bangladesh, where livelihoods are highly dependent on aquatic systems for food supply and income. Traditional wild fish harvest in the rivers and aquaculture systems, including ghers, ponds, and crab points have been changing in terms of the uses and intensity of management, and suffering from climate change impacts as well. By means of six focus groups with 50 participants total, and validated by expert consultations, we conduct an analysis to understand the main perceived impacts from climate and human activities; and the adaptation responses from the aquatic system livelihoods. We find that biodiversity has decreased drastically, while farmed species have increased and shrimp gher farming turned more intensive becoming the main source of income. All these changes have important implications for food supply in the region and environmental sustainability. Dramatic responses taken in the communities include exit the fisheries and migration, and more adaptive responses include species diversification, crab fattening and working more on the pond and gher infrastructure. This study evidences the results of the combination of multiple stressors in productive systems and the barriers to adaptation in aquatic ecosystem dependent communities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Societies need to govern soils to maintain the various ecosystem services provided to humans, for instance ensuring food security, biodiversity conservation, water regulation or carbon sequestration. Developing suitable policy instruments is therefore a precondition to implementing sustainable soil management practices. However, there is a lack of analytical tools to systematically describe the performance of instruments for soil governance. This paper presents and applies an analytical framework for soil governance. Governance performance is assessed with the following dimensions: capacity to support resilience, effectiveness, efficiency, and legitimacy (REEL). We also specify each dimension in more detail by using indicators to enable an assessment of each criterion. These core indicators need to be analysed on different spatial and temporal scales. The development of the framework was based on a review of existing literature on environmental and natural resource governance. It is built upon existing frameworks and focuses specifically on a systematic description and evaluation of instruments. Additionally, the paper shows two examples of how to apply the framework: A systematic description of agri-environmental and climate measures (AECM) in Germany’s Free State of Saxony and an ex-ante policy comparison of two instruments for steering land-development. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The coastal and marine ecosystem provides critical ecosystem services to millions of people living in a densely populated Bangladesh. In recent decades, the ecosystem faces a number of challenges derived from both natural and anthropogenic sources that put pressures on the sustainability of the social and ecological system. Moreover, the government recent initiatives to enhance the ocean-based blue economy and achieve sustainable development goals, particularly SDG 14 calls for developing a comprehensive conservation strategy for the coastal and marine environment. Based on literature review and stakeholders consultation, this study formulated a detailed conservation strategy for the coastal and marine environment of Bangladesh. The strategy of nine interrelated sectors, their objectives and the action plan towards achieving these objectives were outlined. Implementing these strategies will play an instrumental role in enhancing blue growth and achieving sustainable development goals either directly or indirectly. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lao PDR is a poorly-developed country with a large rural population which relies almost exclusively on agricultural production systems as their means of livelihood. Even though surface water is abundant, Lao PDR is still vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate variability and climate change - flooding and heavy monsoon rains are common but the country also experiences long and prolonged dry seasons with pronounced and common water scarcity. Shortages, both spatially and temporally are increasingly being met with supplies from groundwater. As groundwater management is still at a very basic level and perhaps the single most important constraint to progress, the goal of our SEG-Geoscientists without Borders project is to build human and institutional capacity in-country and resilience in agricultural productivity through sustainable use of groundwater for local farmers on the Vientiane Plain, Lao PDR. The project is a collaboration with a number of Lao project partners, made up primarily of stakeholders from government, university, private-sector representatives and the local communities. This collaboration is intended to build and strengthen capacity of our Lao partners through the application and use of hydrogeophysical techniques to identify and characterize the groundwater aquifer systems along a transect on the Vientiane Plain. The project has provided local undergraduate and postgraduate training opportunities for a number of students by introducing and training students in the use of a number of different geophysical techniques, including frequency and time domain electromagnetic induction (FDEM and TDEM), electrical resistivity, ground penetrating radar (GPR), borehole geophysical logging (NMR), and hydrogeological field assessment skills. Specifically, we aimed in this project to: (1) train students and staff of the National University of Laos and staff of the Department of Water Resources (DWR), Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Lao PDR in the use of near-surface geophysics, as well as the collection and use of complementary hydrogeophysical data sets; (2) involve local community members in raising awareness of proper groundwater management and water use for increasing sustainable food production by providing training and water quality field kits for long-term deployment in the community; (3) improve groundwater management by scientific understanding of the hydrogeological system underlying the Vientiane Plain including detailed water quality analysis of the groundwater to ensure that it meets water quality guidelines for the intended use; and (5) validate and 'ground-truth' the new geophysical data sets with the collection of hydrogeological and hydrochemistry data and water balance modelling; all information needed to improve the chances of making informed water management decisions. This project will contribute to the development of reliable hydrogeological maps that can be used to improve the prospects for securing good supplies and delineate good and poor quality water to lower the risk of well failure and groundwater contamination on the Vientiane Plain. It will assist local community members, farmers and government to expand groundwater development for agricultural production and strengthen the resilience of agriculture to climatic uncertainties. The scientific information has the potential to benefit rural livelihood enhancement through the sustainable use of groundwater and ensure that groundwater use for other purposes including domestic and drinking supplies, as well as for ecosystem services are not compromised. The study will add considerable scientific weight to ensuring that groundwater in Lao PDR provides a reliable, safe and secure resource into the future. We recently completed a large training/data collection campaign over the field area in the Vientiane Basin. Data were collected from 14 to 25 March 2018 at 19 field sites; six sites were investigated using multiple techniques. While these data have only just been collected and will require extensive analysis we present initial results from one transect here. © 2018 SEG

AB  - Balanced and precise crop nutrients application is a pre-requisite tool for meeting the second Sustainable Development Goals for achieving food security and improved human nutrition and to promote agriculture under stressful environments. Large increase in productivity cannot be attained without ensuring that plants are supplied with adequate and balanced mineral nutrients. Mineral fertilizers are an important basic resource for nearly half of the world's crop production. The productivity of food, feed, fiber, and biofuel is ought to be paralleled with global population that is expected to reach nine billion before the middle of twenty-first century. Among the nutrient management system, the foliar feeding provides a potential prospective option to meet the diversity of site- and crop-specific conditions, irrigation water supplies, eco-edaphic factors and farm management, and also concurrent economic and environmental prospective. Taking trade-off into account, the foliar feeding of essential nutrients will accrue in mitigating the negative effects of abiotic stresses, with concurrent maximizing productivity. This technique is cost-effective and beneficial under stressful conditions. The plants well-fed with essential nutrients have greater tolerance capacity in response to abiotic stresses. Thereby foliar feeding of nutrients is also referred as climate-smart agriculture. The response of foliar feeding varies greatly due to crop species, growth stages, concentration of added nutrient solution, and the relative water content in the plant parts. The plant nutrients, their importance in crop production, and some insights into how to best manage them by foliar feeding method in response to abiotic stresses are discussed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

AB  - In discussions of human-environmental dynamics and climate change, treatments of water usually focus on the problem of drought. Monsoon environments constitute a different set of parameters for landscape interactions because of seasonal episodes of water abundance. In this paper, we evaluate the microscale management of routine and anticipated high-water events for the ancient Indian subcontinent, where people used the monsoon cycle to engage in rice farming that in turn supported the growth of cities. Rice production would have encompassed two fluctuating inputs: rural labor, which may have become scarce when villagers left farmlands to become city dwellers; and water, the quantity of which varies dramatically on both a seasonal basis because of the monsoon and on an occasional basis because of tropical cyclones. The abundance of water (even with its risks of overabundance) encompassed numerous logistical challenges but also permitted high productivity within short distances of urban centers. The case study of the ancient city of Sisupalgarh in eastern India illustrates that high levels of productivity per land area enabled city residents to engage in short-distance economies for food production, while maintaining regional contacts through durable-goods trade to mitigate occasional episodes of crop failure in times of major flooding. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Introduction of high-performing crop cultivars and crop/soil water management practices that increase the stomatal uptake of carbon dioxide and photosynthesis will be instrumental in realizing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of achieving food security. To date, however, global assessments of how to increase crop yield have failed to consider the negative effects of tropospheric ozone, a gaseous pollutant that enters the leaf stomatal pores of plants along with carbon dioxide, and is increasing in concentration globally, particularly in rapidly developing countries. Earlier studies have simply estimated that the largest effects are in the areas with the highest ozone concentrations. Using a modelling method that accounts for the effects of soil moisture deficit and meteorological factors on the stomatal uptake of ozone, we show for the first time that ozone impacts on wheat yield are particularly large in humid rain-fed and irrigated areas of major wheat-producing countries (e.g. United States, France, India, China and Russia). Averaged over 2010–2012, we estimate that ozone reduces wheat yields by a mean 9.9% in the northern hemisphere and 6.2% in the southern hemisphere, corresponding to some 85 Tg (million tonnes) of lost grain. Total production losses in developing countries receiving Official Development Assistance are 50% higher than those in developed countries, potentially reducing the possibility of achieving UN SDG2. Crucially, our analysis shows that ozone could reduce the potential yield benefits of increasing irrigation usage in response to climate change because added irrigation increases the uptake and subsequent negative effects of the pollutant. We show that mitigation of air pollution in a changing climate could play a vital role in achieving the above-mentioned UN SDG, while also contributing to other SDGs related to human health and well-being, ecosystems and climate change. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Climate change has far-reaching effects on human and ecological systems, requiring collaboration across sectors and disciplines to determine effective responses. To inform regional responses to climate change, decision-makers need credible and relevant information representing a wide swath of knowledge and perspectives. The southeastern U. S. State of Georgia is a valuable focal area for study because it contains multiple ecological zones that vary greatly in land use and economic activities, and it is vulnerable to diverse climate change impacts. We identified 40 important research questions that, if answered, could lay the groundwork for effective, science-based climate action in Georgia. Top research priorities were identified through a broad solicitation of candidate research questions (180 were received). A group of experts across sectors and disciplines gathered for a workshop to categorize, prioritize, and filter the candidate questions, identify missing topics, and rewrite questions. Participants then collectively chose the 40 most important questions. This cross-sectoral effort ensured the inclusion of a diversity of topics and questions (e.g., coastal hazards, agricultural production, ecosystem functioning, urban infrastructure, and human health) likely to be important to Georgia policy-makers, practitioners, and scientists. Several cross-cutting themes emerged, including the need for long-term data collection and consideration of at-risk Georgia citizens and communities. Workshop participants defined effective responses as those that take economic cost, environmental impacts, and social justice into consideration. Our research highlights the importance of collaborators across disciplines and sectors, and discussing challenges and opportunities that will require transdisciplinary solutions. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Rupestrian grasslands are biodiverse, evolutionary old vegetation complexes that harbor more than 5000 species of vascular plants and one of the highest levels of plant endemism in the world. Growing on nutrient–impoverished soils and under harsh environmental conditions, these mountaintop ecosystems were once spared from major human interventions of agriculture and intensive cattle ranching. However, in Brazil, rupestrian grasslands have experienced one of the most extreme land use changes among all Brazilian ecosystems, suffering from ill policies leading to intense mining activities, uncontrolled tourism, and unplanned road construction. Indeed, the discovery of large mineral reserves, the adoption of ineffective conservation policies, and, going forward, climate change, are threatening this hyper-diverse ecosystem. Here, we shed light on the severe threats imposed by land-use changes in this ecosystem, modeling its future distribution under different scenarios. We uncover a catastrophic forecast that, if not halted, will lead to the loss of 82% of this unique ecosystem in the future, impacting ecosystem services at regional scales, including water and food security potentially affecting more than 50 million persons. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Northern ecosystems are experiencing some of the most dramatic impacts of global change on Earth. Rising temperatures, hydrological intensification, changes in atmospheric acid deposition and associated acidification recovery, and changes in vegetative cover are resulting in fundamental changes in terrestrial–aquatic biogeochemical linkages. The effects of global change are readily observed in alterations in the supply of dissolved organic matter (DOM)—the messenger between terrestrial and lake ecosystems—with potentially profound effects on the structure and function of lakes. Northern terrestrial ecosystems contain substantial stores of organic matter and filter or funnel DOM, affecting the timing and magnitude of DOM delivery to surface waters. This terrestrial DOM is processed in streams, rivers, and lakes, ultimately shifting its composition, stoichiometry, and bioavailability. Here, we explore the potential consequences of these global change-driven effects for lake food webs at northern latitudes. Notably, we provide evidence that increased allochthonous DOM supply to lakes is overwhelming increased autochthonous DOM supply that potentially results from earlier ice-out and a longer growing season. Furthermore, we assess the potential implications of this shift for the nutritional quality of autotrophs in terms of their stoichiometry, fatty acid composition, toxin production, and methylmercury concentration, and therefore, contaminant transfer through the food web. We conclude that global change in northern regions leads not only to reduced primary productivity but also to nutritionally poorer lake food webs, with discernible consequences for the trophic web to fish and humans. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The food-feed competition is one of the complex challenges, and so are the ongoing climate change, land degradation and water shortage for realizing sustainable food production systems. By 2050 the global demand for animal products is projected to increase by 60% to 70%, and developing countries will have a lion's share in this increase. Currently, ~800 million tonnes of cereals (one-third of total cereal production) are used in animal feed and by 2050 it is projected to be over 1.1 billion tonnes. Most of the increase in feed demand will be in developing countries, which already face many food security challenges. Additional feed required for the projected increased demand of animal products, if met through food grains, will further exacerbate the food insecurity in these countries. Furthermore, globally, the production, processing and transport of feed account for 45% of the greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector. This paper presents approaches for addressing these challenges in quest for making livestock sector more sustainable. The use of novel human-inedible feed resources such as insect meals, leaf meals, protein isolates, single cell protein produced using waste streams, protein hydrolysates, spineless cactus, algae, co-products of the biofuel industry, food wastes among others, has enormous prospects. Efficient use of grasslands also offers possibilities for increasing carbon sequestration, land reclamation and livestock productivity. Opportunities also exist for decreasing feed wastages by simple and well proven practices such as use of appropriate troughs, increase in efficiency of harvesting crop residues and their conversion to complete feeds especially in the form of densified feed blocks or pellets, feeding as per the nutrient requirements, among others. Available evidence have been presented to substantiate arguments that: (a) for successful and sustained adoption of a feed technology, participation of the private sector and a sound business plan are required, (b) for sustainability of the livestock production systems, it is also important to consider the consumption of animal products and a case has been presented to assess future needs of animal source foods based on their requirements for healthy living, (c) for dairy animals, calculation of Emission Intensity based on the lifetime lactation rather than one lactation may also be considered and (d) for assessment of the efficiency of livestock production systems a holistic approach is required that takes into consideration social dimensions and net human-edible protein output from the system in addition to carbon and water footprints. © 2018 The Animal Consortium.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation typical of the Mediterranean region is the result of long-term settlement history and continuous socioeconomic interactions among countries. In complex agro-ecosystems of the Mediterranean basin, formulation of practical guidelines aimed at counteract soil and land degradation, water depletion, rural area depopulation, and the loss of agricultural knowledge is imperative. Based on a multidisciplinary, integrated approach, the present contribution discusses the role of traditional agricultural systems in ecosystem services provision, considering together economic sustainability and the medium-term ecological benefits. A permanent monitoring of rural areas specialized in traditional crop production such as olive and vine may support optimal selection of cultivars finely adapted to a warm climate. A competitive agricultural system may consider human well-being, social equity, and conservation of natural resources, to ensure a high level of services for current and future generations. Recovery and conservation of agricultural resources provide positive externalities and social benefits at both local and regional levels. Understanding the multiple use and functions of tree crop landscapes will contribute to improve food security, land quality, and the provision of related ecosystem services. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Conventional fossil fuel-based development models and intensive human activity have caused severe impacts on the environment. As a result, the world faces a series of major environmental, economic and social challenges that must be addressed if future welfare for all is to be guaranteed. Renewed initiatives are necessary to face the progressive climate change and the vulnerability of some regions, biodiversity reduction, food and nutritional security, depletion of water and soil resources, as well as social inequities. It is clear that continuing with the same development model is not an option, and that it is essential to adjust the economic and social patterns in order to comply with the United Nations Sustainable Development Objectives (SDOs). This document presents the bioeconomy model as a comprehensive development proposal with environmental, social and economic sustainability. What makes this new economic model different is the incorporation of knowledge for the definition of new alternatives and productive paths, fostering the production and the intensive use of knowledge related to biological resources, processes and principles, and the sustainable supply of goods and services in all economic sectors thus migrating from the unsustainable oil-based economy to the biomass economy. In order to be successful, the adoption of this model requires decisive political determination as well as strong commitment from the scientists and all members of society. © 2018. Acad. Colomb.

AB  - South Africa is classified as a water-scarce country, and depends on agriculture for food production. The irrigation sector is the largest consumer of water in the country, accounting for about 62% of water utilisation, but also losing 30–40%. Given the threat of drought and climate change, efficient irrigation systems have become a necessity, especially in the smallholder farming sector where most losses occur. Smallholder irrigation schemes (SIS) were developed to improve rural livelihoods through sustainable food production for food security and poverty alleviation, but these development objectives remain largely unfulfilled. The objectives of this review were to assess challenges facing SIS and explore opportunities for revitalising the schemes. The focus was on government policy and strategies to support smallholder farmers. A review of government policy showed that although the needs and interests of smallholder farmers are high on the national agenda, there is insufficient financial support to the sector, suggesting that smallholder agriculture is not really seen as a potential driver of the economy. The core focus of the government on repairing irrigation infrastructure while neglecting the soft components relating to capacity building has partly been blamed for the failure of SIS in South Africa. Capacity building is one of the missing links in smallholder irrigation development and many failures have been attributed to lack of adequately trained farmers and extension staff, particularly in irrigation water management. Land tenure insecurity has been singled out as a major institutional challenge leading to poor performance of irrigation schemes. The diversity of schemes means that different kinds of interventions are needed to respond to varying farmers’ needs, resources and agricultural contexts. These findings point to the need to balance the soft and hard components of the irrigation schemes for sustainability. It is therefore evident that the government needs to review its priorities in revitalisation of SIS. Land tenure policies allowing increased access to arable land need to be developed urgently, together with the promotion of alternative cropping systems that are suitable for the smallholder farming sector. © 2018, South African Water Research Commission.

AB  - To accurately assess the roles of agriculture in securing food security and maintaining environmental sustainability, it is essential to improve the representation of crop growth, development, and yield formation in global land models that traditionally focus on energy, water, carbon, and nitrogen exchanges between land and the atmosphere. In this study, a process-based agricultural module has been coupled with the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM-AG2.0) for assessing how multiple environmental factors (climate change, atmospheric CO2 concentration, tropospheric O3, and nitrogen deposition) and human activities (land use/cover change, nitrogen fertilizer use, and irrigation) have affected the crop growth, development, yield, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and water cycles in agroecosystems. Here we describe the model structure for simulating crop growth, development, and yield formation in the DLEM-AG2.0, and then we validate the model using field observations and a national yield survey for three major crops (wheat, maize, and rice) in China during 1980–2012. Results show that the DLEM-AG2.0 is capable of simulating the dynamic processes of phenological development, leaf growth expansion, biomass accumulation, biomass allocation, and yield formation for wheat, maize, and rice with normalized root mean square errors of the simulations of less than 20%. Our model-based yield estimation for the three major crops at the national scale for the period 1980–2012 is generally consistent with the national yield survey in China. The crop representation in the DLEM-AG2.0 is flexible for extrapolating to a global scale after rigorous testing with both site-specific and regional observations. Further advancement of agricultural modeling within the global land modeling framework will require consideration of human perception and behavior for adapting and mitigating global change. ©2018.

AB  - The World Health Organization defined climate change as the most important issue for the 21st century. In 2014, the State of Hawaii called climate change “a matter of security” that directly threatens “economic systems - food, water, energy, biodiversity and health” and has called for “actionable information for local decision making.” According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the burden of human morbidity attributable to climate change is relatively small although not well quantified. Nevertheless, generic climate change impacts are often used to justify actions without adequate supporting local evidence. This paper analyzes Hawaii's health risks in relation to air pollution, heat extremes, ultraviolet radiation, and weather extremes and finds that Hawaii's natural geography, robust water, and sanitation infrastructure render the islands less vulnerable to many of the often-mentioned climate change threats. It concludes that the health security threat posed by climate change effects on Hawaii's physical environment over the next 35 years is slight in most areas and moderate with regard to ecosystem health. Because all global communities tend to be both discrete and unique in their vulnerability, it recommends the collection of grassroots, community-based resilience data to reveal local vulnerabilities that can inform strategic statewide planning. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Oasis landscape change and its pattern dynamics are considered one of the vital research areas on global land use and landscape change in arid regions. An agricultural oasis is the main site of food security and ecosystem services in arid areas. Recently, the dramatic exploitation of agricultural oases has affected oasis stability, inducing some ecological and environmental issues such as water shortage and land degradation. In this study, the Qira oasis on the southern margin of Tarim Basin, Northwest China, was selected as a study area to examine the spatiotemporal changes in an agricultural oasis and the influence on oasis landscape pattern. Based on the integration of Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and GF-1 images, the agricultural Qira oasis has rapidly increased, with annual change rates of -0.3%, 1.6%, 3.7%, and 1.5% during 1970-1990, 1990-2000, 2000-2013, and 2013-2016, respectively. With the agricultural oasis expansion, the agricultural land has increased from 91.10 km2 in 1970 to 105.04 km2 in 2016. The percentage of farmland area has increased by 15.3% in 2016 compared with that in 1970. The natural vegetation is decreasing owing to the reclamation of desert-oasis ecotone. The oasis landscape change and pattern are mainly affected by agricultural expansion under water-saving technological utilization, land use policy, and regional economic development demand. The expansion of agricultural oasis is alarming due to human overexploitation. Thus, the government should adjust the layout of agricultural development and pay considerable attention to the oasis environment sustainability. This study can provide a valuable reference on the impact of climate change and human activities on a landscape. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Climate change has increased the occurrence of extreme weather patterns globally, causing significant reductions in crop production, and hence threatening food security. In order to meet the food demand of the growing world population, a faster rate of genetic gains leading to productivity enhancement for major crops is required. Grain legumes are an essential commodity in optimal human diets and animal feed because of their unique nutritional composition. Currently, limited water is a major constraint in grain legume production. Root system architecture (RSA) is an important developmental and agronomic trait, which plays vital roles in plant adaptation and productivity under water-limited environments. A deep and proliferative root system helps extract sufficient water and nutrients under these stress conditions. The integrated genetics and genomics approach to dissect molecular processes from genome to phenome is key to achieve increased water capture and use efficiency through developing better root systems. Success in crop improvement under drought depends on discovery and utilization of genetic variations existing in the germplasm. In this review, we summarize current progress in the genetic diversity in major legume crops, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with RSA, and the importance and applications of recent discoveries associated with the beneficial root traits towards better RSA for enhanced drought tolerance and yield. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Trees are crucial for sustaining life on our planet. Forests and land devoted to tree crops do not only supply essential edible products to humans and animals, but also additional goods such as paper or wood. They also prevent soil erosion, support microbial, animal, and plant biodiversity, play key roles in nutrient and water cycling processes, and mitigate the effects of climate change acting as carbon dioxide sinks. Hence, the health of forests and tree cropping systems is of particular significance. In particular, soil/rhizosphere/root-associated microbial communities (known as microbiota) are decisive to sustain the fitness, development, and productivity of trees. These benefits rely on processes aiming to enhance nutrient assimilation efficiency (plant growth promotion) and/or to protect against a number of (a)biotic constraints. Moreover, specific members of the microbial communities associated with perennial tree crops interact with soil invertebrate food webs, underpinning many density regulation mechanisms. This review discusses belowground microbiota interactions influencing the growth of tree crops. The study of tree-(micro)organism interactions taking place at the belowground level is crucial to understand how they contribute to processes like carbon sequestration, regulation of ecosystem functioning, and nutrient cycling. A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between roots and their associate microbiota can also facilitate the design of novel sustainable approaches for the benefit of these relevant agro-ecosystems. Here, we summarize the methodological approaches to unravel the composition and function of belowground microbiota, the factors influencing their interaction with tree crops, their benefits and harms, with a focus on representative examples of Biological Control Agents (BCA) used against relevant biotic constraints of tree crops. Finally, we add some concluding remarks and suggest future perspectives concerning the microbiota-assisted management strategies to sustain tree crops. © 2018 Mercado-Blanco, Abrantes, Barra Caracciolo, Bevivino, Ciancio, Grenni, Hrynkiewicz, Kredics and Proença.

AB  - Soil is considered the key connection for material and energy transfer and transformation in the Earth's surface layer. Soil's components and ecological functions have been dramatically affected by rapid urbanization in recent decades. This is especially true for peri-urban ecosystems. A peri-urban ecosystem comprises the interaction and transition zones between urban and rural or natural ecosystems. Soils in peri-urban ecosystems are identified with both urban and rural/natural ecosystems' structural and functional features, and are prone to being affected by urbanization pressures. Soils in peri-urban ecosystems provide essential life-support functions and ecosystem services for urban and rural residents, including food supply, water purification, water conservation, contamination interception, leisure and entertainment services, cultural services, and more. Under rapid urbanization, a large area of agricultural and natural landscapes are converted to urban landscapes. Soils in peri-urban ecosystems therefore tend to be significantly disturbed because of increasing human activities, which change the soil processes and reduce the quality and diversity of soil functions such as food production, pollution attenuation, hydrological cycling, and energy balance. The inherent conflicts between urbanization and soil security have been studied for a long time. As urbanization levels in peri-urban ecosystems have increased, soil security problems in peri-urban ecosystems have been a key issue in recent studies. This study reviews published literature concerning soil security in peri-urban ecosystems and aims to contribute to scientific understanding of the interrelations between soil security and urbanization. Statistical analysis showed that the number of published papers concerning peri-urban ecosystems rapidly increased after 2000, especially in the past 5 years. Many studies concerning soil security were focused on urbanization' s influence on soil processes in urban areas, including cropland loss, food production, climate change, and other processes linked with soils. However, only a limited number of studies that focused on peri-urban areas were found. The soil security problems in peri-urban ecosystem areas were often ignored by both rural and urban ecosystems research. In this review, the particularity and complexity of soil security in peri-urban ecosystems are discussed. In summary, we suggest that future peri-urban studies should focus on the following issues: (1) exploring comparative studies at a large scale under different urban sprawl modes, (2) exploring the tradeoff of ecosystem services in the framework of soil security in peri-urban ecosystems, and perspectives on current solutions for soil security in peri-urban ecosystems are proposed, (3) exploring the sources of contaminants in soil and their co-contamination in peri-urban ecosystems, and optimizing landscape patterns to promote soil security and ecosystem services, and (4) considering the sustainable development goals of peri-urban ecosystems and highlighting the multi-dimensional role of soil security in sustainable policy and management. Because soils in peri-urban ecosystems have their own unique set of socioeconomic and ecological features, soil security should be emphasized for understanding the environmental response to global urbanization. © 2018 Science Press.

AB  - Freshwater availability is changing worldwide. Here we quantify 34 trends in terrestrial water storage observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites during 2002-2016 and categorize their drivers as natural interannual variability, unsustainable groundwater consumption, climate change or combinations thereof. Several of these trends had been lacking thorough investigation and attribution, including massive changes in northwestern China and the Okavango Delta. Others are consistent with climate model predictions. This observation-based assessment of how the world's water landscape is responding to human impacts and climate variations provides a blueprint for evaluating and predicting emerging threats to water and food security. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Science policy in the Arab Region is in a state of turmoil, due to incompatibility, instability, and most importantly an absence of the political will to capitalize on R&D for development and self-reliance. In 2009, the Arab Economic Summit in Kuwait (Badran 2017) proclaimed a resolution that priority of research in the Arab Region responding to local needs with global impact is the triangle of energy, water, and food security nexus. Investment in research and in relevant quality higher education, responding to local needs, is a priority for building the knowledge economy based on human capital, knowledge created by basic research to stimulate innovation, and introduction of new technologies to overcome unemployment and poverty. Delivery of problem-oriented research by universities, research centers and corporate entities is strongly linked to the development and creation of wealth. Indicators show that UAE & Qatar are leading the Arab countries in the global competitiveness index (2016-2017). Academia - the environment or community concerned with the pursuit of research, education and scholarship - in universities, research institutes and multinational corporations provided the demographics survey of global research outputs. In addition, the indicators show that investment in research is done mostly by governments in the Arab Region compared with OECD countries where research is done mostly by the private sector. The U.S. is still leading the world in investing in science by having a 2.8% of its GDP - $465 billion/year, and 50% of world Noble laureates in science and medicine. In the Arab world, Morocco is leading the investment in research (0.73% of its GDP), followed by Tunisia, Egypt and UAE, while Tunisia is leading in the number of researchers (FTEs per million people) followed by Morocco and Egypt. In the number of scientific peer-reviewed papers, the U.S. is leading the world, (21% of world), followed by China, Japan, Germany and UK, while in the Arab world, Egypt is leading followed by Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Morocco, UAE and Indexed publication (Scopus) intensity in the Middle East is led by Turkey, followed by Iran, Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Morocco, UAE and Jordan, while the citation is led by Israel, Lebanon, Kuwait, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Morocco. As an indicator of technology in terms of the percentage of total exports, high technology exports in the Arab region are led by Tunisia followed by Morocco, Qatar and Kuwait, while Singapore is leading the world. Another indicator of technology is patents; China, United States and Japan are leading the world in patents filed (2014), while UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco are leading the Arab world in patents filed. However, for resident patents applications per $100 billion of GDP, S. Korea followed by Japan, China, and Finland are the world leaders (2015). © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global concern for land use revolves around human activity, such as agriculture for food, employment, recreation, and daily sustenance (e.g., air, water, shelter). While the introduction of policy helps to abate the impact of detrimental land use practices in the United States, other national food sustainability indicators created by The Economist Intelligence Unit and the Barilla Center for Food & Nutrition (BCFN) introduce new performance metrics that inform policy. These indicators, such as the environmental impact of agriculture on natural land and water resources, provide a method to determine if key factors are being addressed or have yet to progress towards desired targets and then compare results to other nations. The Food Sustainability Index report, based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and other international input such as the Milan Protocol, demonstrates the US status in the global race for improvements in diet, agricultural practices, and food waste. This brief reflects positive, marginal and poor indicators of US headway on overarching problems relating to climate change, such as food loss and waste, sustainable agriculture, and nutritional challenges impacting the ecosystem and population health. These indicators provide a baseline and pro- gression to pinpoint areas that remain unresolved to educate, spur on innovators to pioneer solutions, and guide policymakers. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - In this era of global changes, rapid urbanization rates, climate change impacts and growing socio-environmental concerns are negatively impacting on various aspects of urban life, such as human health and well-being, urban economy stability, biodiversity levels, land productivity and natural resources availability. In this context, cities - having become the main centres of consumption and production worldwide - need to move towards more sustainable and resilient urban development models, considering novel approaches aimed at integrating grey and green infrastructure, economic growth and environmental concerns, knowledge diffusion and poverty and hunger eradication. In this regard, the implementation of urban and peri-urban agroforestry (UPAF) systems - associated with the integration of urban food systems into urban planning - can greatly support the provision of ecosystem services to urban dwellers, thus contributing to the improvement of their livelihood through increased food and nutrition security, energy and fresh water availability, regulation of local climate, carbon sequestration, maintenance of genetic diversity, recreation opportunities and health improvement. In this sense, UPAF is emerging as a new urban practice addressed to promote sustainable land use as well as the integration between urban and rural development. However, its implementation in urban contexts presents several key challenges, such as land tenure conflicts, lack of integration with urban policies and plans and technical knowledge, as well as necessity of innovative governance models. In this context, the aim of this chapter is to outline, through a review of the relevant literature and case studies from both developed and developing countries, the benefits deriving from the implementation of UPAF systems and highlight how these practices can support the improvement of urban sustainability and resilience, particularly in terms of enhancement of provisioning, cultural, regulating and supporting ecosystem services. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

AB  - Owing to the shortfalls in conventional approaches to forestry and agriculture, agroforestry has been receiving attention among researchers and policy-makers since the 1970s as an alternative land use strategy in tropical systems. Agroforestry is a promising strategy for deriving a range of benefits, such as food and water security, ecosystem health, energy security, and human health particularly in developing nations. Agroforestry is also posited as a means of producing various ecosystem services necessary for mitigation and adaptation to climate change impacts. In spite of these expected benefits, the adoption of agroforestry policies has been limited, and the potential contributions of agroforestry to resilience and sustainable development remain unrealized. Drawing from theoretical insights in ecosystem management and adaptive governance, this chapter discusses the potential benefits of managing agroforestry systems as complex adaptive social-ecological systems. Ecosystem-based adaptive governance holds promise as a framework for increasing the adoption of agroforestry as a land-use strategy for achieving sustainable development and social-ecological resilience by promoting a more inclusive and dynamic approach to developing locally-based agroforestry models. The modified taungya system in Ghana and other relevant case studies are used to illustrate the argument. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

AB  - The Food and Agriculture Organization considers around a quarter of global land to be degraded. Of particular concern are threats to soils in water-limited regions, which are critical to food and economic security in countries across the globe but are under increasing pressure due to human use and climatic forcing. These soils have been used to feed and provide resources and services to human societies for millennia, with earliest land-uses dating back to prehistoric times. With the adoption of modern, frequently unsuitable agricultural practices combined with the population pressures and shifting consumption patterns, soils in water-limited regions have come under threat, resulting in degradation and in worst-case scenarios, desertification. Here, we review the current state of soils in water-limited environments and provide a guide to management for conservation and restoration of these fragile soils. Options to manage specific threats to soil functionality, namely, erosion, soil salinity, loss of functionality due to landscape homogenization, degradation of soil organic matter, and climate vulnerability are presented for specific land-uses using a whole-system approach management framework.

AB  - Negative emission technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) are regarded as an option to achieve the climatic target of the Paris Agreement. However, our understanding of the realistic sustainable feasibility of the global lands for BECCS remains uncertain. In this study, we assess the impact of BECCS deployment scenarios on the land systems including land use, water resources, and ecosystem services. Specifically, we assess three land-use scenarios to achieve the total amount of 3.3 GtC year−1 (annual negative emission level required for IPCC-RCP 2.6) emission reduction by growing bioenergy crops which requires huge use of global agricultural and forest lands and water. Our study shows that (1) vast conversion of food cropland into rainfed bio-crop cultivation yields a considerable loss of food production that may not be tolerable considering the population increase in the future. (2) When irrigation is applied to bio-crop production, the bioenergy crop productivity is enhanced. This suppresses the necessary area for bio-crop production to half, and saves the land for agricultural productions. However, water consumption is doubled and this may exacerbate global water stress. (3) If conversion of forest land for bioenergy crop cultivation is allowed without protecting the natural forests, large areas of tropical forest could be used for bioenergy crop production. Forest biomass and soil carbon stocks are reduced, implying degradation of the climate regulation and other ecosystem services. These results suggest that without a careful consideration of the land use for bioenergy crop production, a large-scale implementation of BECCS could negatively impact food, water and ecosystem services that are supporting fundamental human sustainability. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Climate change causes environmental depletion, with threats to the global economy. The health and productivity of ecosystems underpin agriculture, with stable ecosystems being the foundation for economic livelihoods and food security. This study proposes adaptation measures, using geospatial technology, for conserving natural resources and improving livelihoods of the local community from climate change scenarios. Planning, policy decisions and resultant programmes are required for natural resource management, which must be based on broad citizen participation and the engagement of rural communities. The suggested adaptation measures will help the planning system to regulate development of natural resources and the socio-economic environment. The major natural resources in the environment are land and water, both of which can be severely degraded by human interventions, as well as climate change. Various thematic maps are prepared with the use of geospatial technology, in order to be helpful for site-suitability analysis directed to the preparation of land and water management action plans for socio-economic development. The study area is a micro-watershed of the catchment of Ansupa Lake in the Cuttack District of Odisha, India. To reduce climate change impacts on natural resources and economic livelihoods, some adaptation measures have been proposed (e.g., 68.9 ha for afforestation.; 13.94 ha for gap plantations and agro-horticulture; 389.62 ha for farm ponds and renovation of existing ponds for pisciculture and duckery activities, etc.; 11.33 ha for land management, along with five bore wells, eight dug wells, 51 LBS/check dams, and four WHSs, etc., for water management for sustainable use). © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Climate change is expected to affect resource-consumer interactions underlying stability in polar food webs. Polar benthic organisms have adapted to the marked seasonality charac-terising their habitats by concentrating foraging and reproductive activity in summer months, when inputs from sympagic and pelagic producers increase. While this enables the persistence of biodiverse food webs, the mechanisms underlying changes in resource use and nutrient transfer are poorly understood. Thus, our understanding of how temporal and spatial variations in the supply of resources may affect food web structure and functioning is limited. By means of C and N isotopic analyses of two key Antarctic benthic consumers (Adamussium colbecki, Bivalvia, and Sterechinus neumayeri, Echinoidea) and Bayesian mixing models, we describe changes in trophic niche and nutrient transfer across trophic levels associated with the long- and short-term diet and body size of specimens sampled in midsummer in both shallow and deep waters. Samplings occurred soon after the sea-ice broke up at Tethys Bay, an area characterised by extreme seasonality in sea-ice coverage and productivity in the Ross Sea. In the long term, the trophic niche was broader and variation between specimens was greater, with intermediate-size specimens generally consuming a higher number of resources than small and large specimens. The coupling of energy channels in the food web was consequently more direct than in the short term. Sediment and benthic algae were more frequently consumed in the long term, before the sea-ice broke up, while consumers specialised on sympagic algae and plankton in the short term. Regardless of the time scale, sympagic algae were more frequently consumed in shallow waters, while plankton was more frequently consumed in deep waters. Our results suggest a strong temporal relationship between resource availability and the trophic niche of benthic consumers in Antarctica. Potential climate-driven changes in the timing and quality of nutrient inputs may have profound implications for the structure of polar food webs and the persistence of their constituent species, which have adapted their trophic niches to a highly predictable schedule of resource inputs. © 2018 Calizza et al.

AB  - Influences of the increasing pressure of climate change and anthropogenic activities on wetlands ecosystems and agriculture are significant around the world. This paper assessed the spatiotemporal land use and land cover changes (LULCC), especially for conversion from marshland to other LULC types (e.g., croplands) over the Songnen and Sanjiang Plain (SNP and SJP), northeast China, during the past 35 years (1980-2015). The relative role of human activities and climatic changes in terms of their impacts on wetlands and agriculture dynamics were quantitatively distinguished and evaluated in different periods based on a seven-stage LULC dataset. Our results indicated that human activities, such as population expansion and socioeconomic development, and institutional policies related to wetlands and agriculture were the main driving forces for LULCC of the SJP and SNP during the past decades, while increasing contributions of climatic changes were also found. Furthermore, as few studies have identified which geographic regions are most at risk, how the future climate changes will spatially and temporally impact wetlands and agriculture, i.e., the suitability of wetlands and agriculture distributions under different future climate change scenarios, were predicted and analyzed using a habitat distribution model (Maxent) at the pixel-scale. The present findings can provide valuable references for policy makers on regional sustainability for food security, water resource rational management, agricultural planning and wetland protection as well as restoration of the region. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Fruit tree production faces the major challenge of ensuring maximal productivity with due consideration for the environment and human health. The increasingly recognized concept of ecosystem service could help to address this duality. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework based on a soil crop model to investigate how agricultural management and pedoclimatic conditions affect the joint production of marketed and non-marketed ecosystem services through underlying ecosystem functions in apple orchards. The ecosystem services considered on an annual scale were soil nitrogen availability, climate regulation, water regulation and fruit production. Ecosystem functions and services were described by specific indicators that were quantified using the STICS soil crop model. This model was parameterized using data collected on two experimental apple orchard sites under conventional and low-input or organic management in southeastern France. The interdependencies between environmental components, cultural operations and ecosystem functions were dynamically integrated by the model and highlighted significant interactions between the indicators of ecosystem services. Thus, the service indicators soil organic nitrogen variation and the prevention of nitrogen denitrification and of leaching were positively correlated and in conflict with soil mean nitrate concentration and mean soil humidity. They were also linked negatively to nitrogen mineralization enhanced by irrigation and positively to soil carbon sequestration impacted by fertilization; these two functions were impacted by soil conditions. Yield and carbon sequestration presented a strong synergy and were positively correlated to nitrogen absorption increased by mineral fertilization. Globally, nitrogen fertilization management and planting density were particularly important for the delivery of multiple ecosystem services, but soil and climate effects were far from negligible, especially for nitrogen and water-related services. The ecosystem service profiles of the studied cropping systems were diversified, with contrasted profiles showing high yield and carbon sequestration but low prevention of nitrogen denitrification and of nitrogen leaching, and more balanced profiles. The STICS crop model made it possible to quantify and analyze profiles of ecosystem services and should be helpful in instrumenting the dialogue between fruit growers and other stakeholders by simulating scenarios to optimize multiple services. However, it has to be improved to address the impact of grass cover on soil functions and the long-term functioning of apple orchards. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We review and compare four broad categories of spatially-explicit modelling approaches currently used to understand and project changes in the distribution and productivity of living marine resources including: 1) statistical species distribution models, 2) physiology-based, biophysical models of single life stages or the whole life cycle of species, 3) food web models, and 4) end-to-end models. Single pressures are rare and, in the future, models must be able to examine multiple factors affecting living marine resources such as interactions between: i) climate-driven changes in temperature regimes and acidification, ii) reductions in water quality due to eutrophication, iii) the introduction of alien invasive species, and/or iv) (over-)exploitation by fisheries. Statistical (correlative) approaches can be used to detect historical patterns which may not be relevant in the future. Advancing predictive capacity of changes in distribution and productivity of living marine resources requires explicit modelling of biological and physical mechanisms. New formulations are needed which (depending on the question) will need to strive for more realism in ecophysiology and behaviour of individuals, life history strategies of species, as well as trophodynamic interactions occurring at different spatial scales. Coupling existing models (e.g. physical, biological, economic) is one avenue that has proven successful. However, fundamental advancements are needed to address key issues such as the adaptive capacity of species/groups and ecosystems. The continued development of end-to-end models (e.g., physics to fish to human sectors) will be critical if we hope to assess how multiple pressures may interact to cause changes in living marine resources including the ecological and economic costs and trade-offs of different spatial management strategies. Given the strengths and weaknesses of the various types of models reviewed here, confidence in projections of changes in the distribution and productivity of living marine resources will be increased by assessing model structural uncertainty through biological ensemble modelling. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There are several definitions of food security, but all agree that an impotent outcome is the provision of ‘healthy’ life [1]. To maintain human health, it is important that people not only have enough safe food, but when food is available that they are able to make the correct food choices in order to meet nutritional requirements and assuring these options are available for future generations. Considering all aspects of malnutrition; under-, poor and over-nutrition, the majority if the world’s population are currently facing substantial risks to health [2]. This is likely to be exacerbated in the face of future challenges to our food supply system through population growth and associated reductions in land mass and fresh water availability to support food production, as well as declining energy supplies, ecosystem preservation and climate change [3, 4]. It is essential that research, policy and practice align globally to tackle these issues. The research challenges are inherently inter-sectorial and each discipline must adjust to new ways of working together. Chemistry has underpinned our understanding of the link between food and human health and will play major role in defining the requirements for future nutritional resilience. © 2019 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Desert ecosystems are first and foremost defined and limited by scarceness of water. Heat stress and limitations of food and nutrients resources are secondarily correlated. Water inputs are spatiotemporally highly variable and many of the ecosystem functions are pulse driven. Desert regions are found globally in the subtropical high pressure belts, in the rain shadow of mountain ranges or the continental interior, and bordering cold ocean currents. Even though primary productivity by plants and microorganisms is relatively low, species richness and taxonomical diversity can be fairly high. Taxonomically different organisms evolved traits to cope with water stress and often similar life forms arose due to convergent evolution. Typical desert organisms show traits that allow them to avoid periods of extreme aridity in inactive stages and/or to store water for use during drought; a few organisms evolved traits to tolerate the lack of water altogether. Microbial decomposition in deserts is limited due to aridity and the energy flow in desert ecosystems is dominated by detrivores that form the base of the food chain. Humans show adaptations to hot desert climates and a number of cultural practices arose that enable human populations to live near or in deserts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Arctic peatlands are mire ecosystems distributed across the vast northern edges of the Eurasian and North American continents and the islands and coastal areas of the Arctic and far northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Arctic peatlands are mostly represented by "frozen" mires with much of their organic deposits remaining frozen throughout the year, whose water regime and other characteristics are strongly dependent on permafrost. Primary production in arctic peatlands is low, but the tendency for peat to accumulate is enhanced by the low decomposition rates. The peat layer in arctic peatlands is not thick, and only in rare cases does the peat exceed 4-6 m in depth. Three main permafrost processes are responsible for the variability of arctic frozen peatlands: thermokarst, frost heaving, and cracking. Arctic peatland diversity and distribution across the landscape depends on the climate conditions, permafrost presence, and hydrology-connected landscape dynamics, and adheres to a characteristic pattern which is beneficial to consider in inventory, mapping, or planning of wetland management. The ecosystem diversity of arctic peatlands is presented by paludified shallow peatlands; "frozen" peatland types such as polygon mires, peat plateaus, and palsa mires; and "nonfrozen" peatland types like patterned string fens, raised bogs, riparian mires, coastal tundra, and some types of coastal marsh. Arctic ecosystems are characterized by low species diversity, and typical species are highly specialized and intimately linked to their habitats. The short growing season limits annual production and the ecological niche capacity of these species. Arctic peatlands are highly integrated ecosystems which are extremely fragile to both natural and human-induced perturbations. With climate change, the arctic region will continue to warm more rapidly than the global mean. Peat, as a thermo-isolating material, plays a crucial role in minimizing permafrost thaw. However, climate change-induced peatland degradation introduces positive feedback with permafrost thaw. Accompanying rapid in situ peat decomposition is an increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, specifically methane from saturated peat water and that which was formerly bound in frozen permafrost. Development in such areas often ignores the special hydrological and ecological characteristics that are central to the productivity of these areas. Increased development of the oil and gas industry and its supporting transport infrastructure significantly fragments the landscape and disrupts its hydrology. Even traditional land uses such as reindeer herding are being industrialized. The resulting changes in peatland status will in turn restrict use of the land by the indigenous people who have traditionally depended on peatlands for food including herded reindeer, game, and fish. Thus, there is an urgent need to promote sustainable practices. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2018. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aquaculture plays a vital role in the agro-based economy of Bangladesh through its contributions to employment and income generation, and through provision of food and nutrition for the people of the country. In addition to 1.32 million full-time fisherfolk, 14.7 million people are involved in aquaculture in Bangladesh. Though all of Bangladesh is more or less prone to adverse impacts of climate change, the northern and northwestern drought-prone areas and coastal regions are particularly sensitive because of specific hydrometeorological, climatic, and human-induced hazards. Erratic rain, irregular rainfall, and temperature changes affect the readiness of fish for breeding. In 2009–2010, extreme weather caused late maturity of fish for breeding in the Mymensingh region—the largest aquaculture zone in the country. Fish farmers are struggling with higher production costs due to water scarcity, higher and lower temperatures, day–night temperature fluctuations, and lower productivity of ponds. Hatchery production has also declined because of such causes. The Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan have considered the fisheries sector as one of the potentially most threatened areas to be targeted. The fisheries sector differs from mainstream agriculture and has distinct interactions and needs with respect to climate change. Capture fisheries have unique features of natural resource harvesting linked with ecosystem production processes. Aquaculture complements and increasingly adds to the supply and, though it is more similar to agriculture in its interactions, it has important links with capture fisheries. Most indigenous fish are migratory and rely on seasonal flooding for spawning cues and access to larval rearing habitats (floodplains). Habitat destruction also has a significant impact, as does lack of flooding/rain—an obvious impact of climate change in the last few decades. Since the economic impacts of climate change will have to be borne by individuals, communities, and the government, there is a need to evolve a climate-resilient development strategy involving all of the relevant sectors, including aquaculture. Only eco-friendly, improved, and innovative management practices with insights into technological, environmental, and socioeconomic concerns can mitigate the impact of climate change on aquaculture in Bangladesh and ensure sustainable fish diversity and production. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - Ecological Human Imprint (EHI) is a new index that is of important measure in calculating the human demands and impacts on our global environment. In this respect, the ecological human imprint is a function of all the parameters that interact between the power of ecosystem productivity and human interactions and activities on a particular ecosystem or the demand from that ecosystem. The present paper will cover and analyses the ecosystems’ productivity and the human demand from the ecosystems. It will produce comprehensive analyses in measuring the possibility of capabilities of the ecosystems to provide goods and services to the human beings on our planet Earth. Further, the paper will discuss the models that can be used in measuring the sustainability of ecosystem and in particular, water resources and what we should be doing to maintain the earth healthy ecosystems. In this respect, the paper will assess and introduce a comprehensive model called Ecological Human Imprint (EHI) and water resources change of US (EHI-WR-US) that can describe the status of our ecosystems’ productivities and the impacts of changing of water resources’ availability and human population within the USA Earth boundaries. Furthermore, the paper will provide some answers to the human issues in USA; water resources change impacts as the results of human activities. Further, the model will provide warning to the current trend in use and abuse of our natural ecosystems and what will be expecting from these ecosystems to provide the human needs in response to the current use of US ecosystems that exist. It is clear from the analysis of (EHI-WR-US) that the USA will reach 450 million people or more in the year 2050, and this will overload the ecosystems with heavy demands and consumptions for goods, and services that these ecosystems can produce or cannot produce for the next generations. It is expected that model will assess the impacts of the EHI of human population in US from ecological transformation of land-use, and economic impacts, locally in US. From the analysis, the model predicted that the US biological capacity will be degrading to the extent that the ecosystems will not be able to support the growing populations, and there will be a shortage of food and other services. It is expected that the need will be about twice the land of current land of US to meet the demands from our ecosystems to support the growing population and their life style. In this model, we used Stella Software to predict the impacts of the EHI for the next century and what we should expect beyond quantitatively. The model developed on relaxed assumption, moderate assumption and conservative assumption of human population growth and in consequence, the US EHI biological capacity with all its components, including energy and impacts of climate change that affects the water resources and on the natural resources and availability of cycling natural resource. Accordingly, the warming and related climate changes proceed more rapidly than generally expected before. Weather extremes can cause unsustainable summer heat along with lack of water, fire causing vegetation to burn and will allow loss of forest vegetation. This will end of the destruction and loss of available food and in consequence, the famine and human death. The paper will conclude and set up several recommendations to avoid irreversible impacts of human beings on the ecosystems and our global environment, including the impact of climate change and in consequence, the water resources and finally the sustainability of our ecosystems.

AB  - Soils represent a massive stock of terrestrial organic carbon (C) and act both as a buffer against atmospheric CO2 increase and as a potential sink for additional C depending on the balance between photosynthesis, the respiration of decomposer organisms, and stabilization of C in soil. Soil organic matter comprising of approximately 58% of soil organic carbon (SOC) is the basis of many soil functions and ecosystem services, including provision of food and fiber, habitats for biodiversity, climate regulation, water filtration and purification, and human heritage. The importance of SOC in maintaining the capacity of soils to perform multiple ecosystem processes has been recognized by farmers in all ancient civilizations. Managing SOC through sustainable agricultural and land use practices has become a widely acknowledged strategy to combat land degradation and desertification, as well as to provide food security in a changing climate. Several national and international efforts have been initiated to implement practical programs of SOC management and the types of farming methods used to promote it. Enhancing and sustaining SOC to increase soil health is also pertinent to advancing Sustainable Development goals of the U.N. including no hunger, good health and well-being, clean water, climate action, and life on land. This chapter briefly highlights the importance of SOC for ecosystem services, national and intergovernmental policies, while also identifying opportunities to increase SOC to address multiple global challenges. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Lao PDR is a poorly-developed country with a large rural population which relies almost exclusively on agricultural production systems as their means of livelihood. Even though surface water is abundant, Lao PDR is still vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate variability and climate change - flooding and heavy monsoon rains are common but the country also experiences long and prolonged dry seasons with pronounced and common water scarcity. Shortages, both spatially and temporally are increasingly being met with supplies from groundwater. As groundwater management is still at a very basic level and perhaps the single most important constraint to progress, the goal of our SEG-Geoscientists without Borders project is to build human and institutional capacity in-country and resilience in agricultural productivity through sustainable use of groundwater for local farmers on the Vientiane Plain, Lao PDR. The project is a collaboration with a number of Lao project partners, made up primarily of stakeholders from government, university, private-sector representatives and the local communities. This collaboration is intended to build and strengthen capacity of our Lao partners through the application and use of hydrogeophysical techniques to identify and characterize the groundwater aquifer systems along a transect on the Vientiane Plain. The project has provided local undergraduate and postgraduate training opportunities for a number of students by introducing and training students in the use of a number of different geophysical techniques, including frequency and time domain electromagnetic induction (FDEM and TDEM), electrical resistivity, ground penetrating radar (GPR), borehole geophysical logging (NMR), and hydrogeological field assessment skills. Specifically, we aimed in this project to: (1) train students and staff of the National University of Laos and staff of the Department of Water Resources (DWR), Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Lao PDR in the use of near-surface geophysics, as well as the collection and use of complementary hydrogeophysical data sets; (2) involve local community members in raising awareness of proper groundwater management and water use for increasing sustainable food production by providing training and water quality field kits for long-term deployment in the community; (3) improve groundwater management by scientific understanding of the hydrogeological system underlying the Vientiane Plain including detailed water quality analysis of the groundwater to ensure that it meets water quality guidelines for the intended use; and (5) validate and 'ground-truth' the new geophysical data sets with the collection of hydrogeological and hydrochemistry data and water balance modelling; all information needed to improve the chances of making informed water management decisions. This project will contribute to the development of reliable hydrogeological maps that can be used to improve the prospects for securing good supplies and delineate good and poor quality water to lower the risk of well failure and groundwater contamination on the Vientiane Plain. It will assist local community members, farmers and government to expand groundwater development for agricultural production and strengthen the resilience of agriculture to climatic uncertainties. The scientific information has the potential to benefit rural livelihood enhancement through the sustainable use of groundwater and ensure that groundwater use for other purposes including domestic and drinking supplies, as well as for ecosystem services are not compromised. The study will add considerable scientific weight to ensuring that groundwater in Lao PDR provides a reliable, safe and secure resource into the future. We recently completed a large training / data collection campaign over the field area in the Vientiane Basin. Data were collected from 14 to 25 March 2018 at 19 field sites; six sites were investigated using multiple techniques. While these data have only just been collected and will require extensive analysis we present initial results from one transect here. © 2018 SEG.

AB  - Hillslopes comprise the greater part of the landscape and as an integral part of drainage basins; they provide water and sediment to water courses. Also, hillslopes are frequently used in agriculture. Soil erosion caused by water is a natural phenomenon, but the negative effects are accentuated by human interventions in the landscape. Soil erosion and nutrient loss are detrimental to agricultural products, food security, and the sustainability of ecosystem functioning. In recent decades, the increased using of chemical fertilizer and corresponding nutrient loss from inclined farmland owing to agricultural activities have received increasing attention from specialists in domain of agriculture, hydrology and environment protection. This paper present the possibility to modeling of processes associated with soil erosion by water on hillslopes with WEPP model. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model developed by United States Department of Agriculture – Agricultural Research Service, is a process-based, distributed parameter, continuous simulation, erosion prediction model, is applicable to hillslope erosion processes (sheet and rill erosion), as well as simulation of the hydrologic and erosion processes on small watersheds. Processes considered in hillslope profile model applications include rill and interrill erosion, sediment transport and deposition, infiltration, soil consolidation, residue and canopy effects on soil detachment and infiltration, surface sealing, rill hydraulics, surface runoff, plant growth, residue decomposition, percolation, evaporation, transpiration, snow melt, frozen soil effects on infiltration and erodibility, climate, tillage effects on soil properties, effects of soil random roughness, and contour effects including potential overtopping of contour ridges. The WEPP model was applied on hillslope situated in Bega river catchment, Timis county, Romania. © SGEM2018.

AB  - The need to climate proof Zimbabwe’s socio-economic development sectors is now a central theme in the country’s climate policy discourse. This stems from the realisation that most of the country’s areas and sectors are already showing signs of vulnerability to the change and variability in the climate system. Accordingly, climate change adaptation is no longer an option but an urgent requirement. However, scholarly attention to the topic has largely remained fragmented in synchrony with the segmented sectoral policy interventions in various adaptation efforts. Research that analyses the major factors underpinning successful adaptation is highly timely given that most of the empirical evidence point towards gaps in adaptive capacities across the country’s climate sensitive sectors. Driven by the acknowledgement that Zimbabwe’s adaptation efforts are chiefly stymied by its predisposition to non-climatic drivers of vulnerability, this paper shows that the country is already showing numerous signs of limits to adaptation. It draws the evidence from various insights and experiences in the agriculture, water, human settlements and health, energy and industry, and biodiversity sectors. Specifically, this report serves to document existing evidence of challenges in successful adaptation in order to guide adaptation policy and practice. In addition, it is intended that this illumination would provide Zimbabwe and other countries, in similar adaptation failure milieu, to formulate strategies meant to build resilience in areas and sectors already showing signs of maladaptation. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - The increase in water pollution from nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen has prompted the Philippine government to issue stringent regulatory standards for wastewater effluent quality. Hence, two alternatives are being proposed to be integrated in the current wastewater treatment plant in the Philippines: biological nutrient removal and nutrient recovery systems. Biological nutrient removal technologies (BNRT) utilize microorganisms to minimize the nutrient content in the effluent streams to the standard limit while leaving high nutrient concentrations to the sludge that is typically transported as waste to landfill. The nutrient recovery system aims to recover phosphorus and nitrogen in the form of struvite (NH4MgPO46H2O) fertiliser from sludge through chemical precipitation. The two proposed systems have been studied in other settings but their effectiveness has not been studied in the Metro Manila setting. There is a need to systematically assess the environmental effects brought about by the proposed systems in Metro Manila, whether beneficial or adverse, in the context of agriculture, food and energy consumption, and wastewater. A holistic evaluation of the environmental benefits and burdens was done using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework considering a cradle-to-grave approach of three scenarios: 1) current wastewater treatment system scenario; 2) biological nutrient recovery technology; and 3) nutrient recovery system. The environmental impact assessment was done using IMPACT2002+ methodology with the following impact indicators: human health, ecosystem quality, climate change and resources. The life cycle assessment of the scenarios shows the potential of the proposed retrofit wastewater systems for Metro Manila that extends to a more sustainable approach in dealing with issues such as water pollution, climate change, resource depletion and even food security. Moreover, a baseline understanding of the food-water-energy-nutrient nexus in the Philippines was established which can be the basis for future life cycle sustainability assessment studies. © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Temperature and sea level rises, extreme weather events, food and water insecurity and loss of biodiversity are gaining notoriety in popular and social media, with the evidence of their presence all around us. Associated impacts can be seen not only in the physical worlds with droughts, rising seas, wild weather and extreme temperatures, but also in the social and economic world. Secondary impacts (Butler and Harley, 2010) on food and water security and human health (Adlong and Dietsch, 2014; McMichael, 2013; Franchini and Mannucci, 2015; Friel, 2010) will affect not only governments, corporate profits and the economy but also job security for communities across the world. The changing climate will bring with it both risks and opportunities. It seems that the threat of disaster as a consequence of climate change offers an opportunity to develop a socially just, culturally respectful and sustainable world with indigenous wisdom paving the way. According to Teixeira and Krings: The communities most affected by environmental injustices are often the same communities where social workers are entrenched in service provision at the individual, family, and community level. (2015: 1) People with limited financial resources are often victims of discrimination, inequity and potentially most vulnerable to the impacts of an unsustainable world. These groups often have established relationships with both statutory and non-government agencies and particularly social workers (Drolet and Sampson, 2014; Gray and Coates, 2015; Grise-Owens, Miller, and Owens, 2014). They will also be further disadvantaged by the impacts of climate change (Lawler, 2011; New Zealand College of Public Health Medicine, 2013). Paradoxically, some of these groups have incredible resilience and resourcefulness demonstrated in a range of creative solutions, movements and communities across the globe that offer alternative approaches to living outside of the mainstream (Tigger-Ross et al., 2015). Social work, being the only profession with social justice embedded in its definition needs to creatively offer support in building resilience and adaptation to impacts of climate change and globalisation (Appleby et al., 2015). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Lena Dominelli; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Despite stubborn resistance from some quarters, the public is beginning to recognise that anthropogenic climate changes pose enormous challenges for humanity and the planet. While climate change is certainly not the only environmental issue facing the earth today, it has emerged as the most urgent and pressing of issues, both overarching and clearly linked with a long list of environmental concerns including deforestation, biodiversity loss, food and water security, pollution and waste. There is now clear evidence of the ways in which anthropogenic climate change is already impacting upon both natural systems and human well-being (IPCC, 2014; CSIRO, 2015; Wahlquist, 2017). It is becoming increasingly obvious that these negative impacts are not being distributed equally, but fall disproportionately on those already in situations of disadvantage (Dominelli, 2012; Wade, 2015; Worland, 2016). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Lena Dominelli; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Introduction In Kenya, approximately 80 percent of land area is classified as either arid or semi-arid, and an estimated 70 percent of the population resides on the relatively more fertile 20 percent (World Bank, 2005; Government of Kenya [GoK], 2012). Within the latter, an estimated 75 percent of renewable surface water resources originate from five highland watersheds: Mount Elgon, the Cherangani Hills, the Mau Forest complex, Mount Kenya, and the Aberdares range (UNEP, 2012). In such a context, these areas take on considerable significance not only to conserve biodiversity, but also more broadly for sustainable development and public administration. Known in Kenyan popular discourse as the country’s “five water towers,” these highland forests support the livelihoods of millions of small-scale farmers, pastoralists, and freshwater fishing communities. As the most recent “status report” from the Kenya Water Towers Agency - the state organization responsible for forested water catchment areas - puts it, rather strikingly: The term “Water Towers of Kenya” refers to montane forests - the mountainous regions that are sources of water. Through their watershed function, Kenya’s Water Towers supply Kenya’s drinking water, its energy, water for irrigation, industry, water for food and other purposes. But all this is threatened by a combination of factors, including human encroachment, climate change, environmental degradation, and unplanned dams and irrigation projects that have a devastating effect on the ecological infrastructure. The outcome is a real threat to Kenya’s water security, stability and surfeit. (KWTA, 2015: 1, emphasis added). And yet, the critical importance of such “ecosystem infrastructure” is not limited to their contribution to water security alone. For example, the UN Environment Program recently estimated economic losses from deforestation in these areas - resulting from the degradation or diminishment of related ecosystem services to downstream industries - to be approximately US$35 million per year, or more than 2.8 times the direct value of profits accruing from sales of timber and other forest products in these areas (UNEP, 2012: 38). Such calculations are characteristic of emerging “natural capital accounting” approaches to the green economy, which are increasingly embraced by both multilateral organizations, donors, and Kenyan state agencies (e.g. GoK, 2013, 2015; KWTA, 2015; UNEP, 2012, 2014). © Cambridge University Press 2018.

AB  - Senegal, as part of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), is facing and will face the impacts of climate change on environmental resource, livelihood practices and food security (Connolly-Boutin and Smith, 2015; Webber, Gaiser and Ewert, 2014; Niang et al., 2014). The Senegal River Delta (hereafter, the Delta) represents the area of study of this research as it has been the setting of many socio-environmental changes during the twentieth century (Meunier, 2017). The expected changes include variations in temperatures and rainfall, and the consequent increase of drought episodes (Webber, Gaiser and Ewert, 2014). Moreover, the likely consequences for human societies include an increase in land and soil degradation, a decline in crop yields, problems of access to water, a decrease in biodiversity, and increased health problems (Mbaye et al., 2015; Meunier, 2017 and references therein). According to the data, the risk in Senegal is to register a decrease up to 50% in the crop yields by 2020 (Tremblay, 2016). In addition, anthropogenic activities, such as land-use changes and deforestation, contribute to climatic disturbances in the country (Tremblay, 2016). Thus, vulnerability in SSA is linked especially with the economic centrality of agriculture, lack of adaptation investments, climate change effects on temperature, and exposure of local communities to extreme events (Diack et al., 2015; Tubiello and Fischer, 2007; Wheeler and von Braun, 2013; Brown and Funk, 2008). In this way, climate change poses the issues of global and State-driven climate change measures which are not aligned to local adaptation requirements (Meunier, 2017). Accordingly, some scientific contributions have tried to analyse resilience of indigenous practices and bottom-up adaptation strategies in contrast with intensive systems of production and use of soil (see for example Bakel communities’ resilience in Tremblay, 2016; WB, 2010). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Giuseppe Forino, Sara Bonati and Lina Maria Calandra.

AB  - Sustainability can be defined in many ways. This chapter describes various dimensions of environmental sustainability including the impact of the climate, human use of land, water and other resources, biodiversity, eutrophication, and the impact and relevance of these dimensions to food systems. It highlights the importance of social and economic sustainability, illustrating how food security, nutritional quality, ethical issues, cultural sensitivity, and human health are all part of sustainability. Challenges in measuring and evaluating the different dimensions of sustainability are discussed. The chapter concludes that despite many gaps in knowledge we already know enough to develop more sustainable food systems and consumption patterns that can contribute to healthy dietary habits for people and can ensure a healthy planet. Multidisciplinary, intersectoral, and systemic approaches are needed to achieve this. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Rivers provide unrivaled opportunity for clean energy via hydropower, but little is known about the potential impact of dam-building on the food security these rivers provide. In tropical rivers, rainfall drives a periodic flood pulse fueling fish production and delivering nutrition to more than 150 million people worldwide. Hydropower will modulate this flood pulse, thereby threatening food security. We identified variance components of the Mekong River flood pulse that predict yield in one of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world. We used these variance components to design an algorithm for a managed hydrograph to explore future yields. This algorithm mimics attributes of discharge variance that drive fishery yield: prolonged low flows followed by a short flood pulse. Designed flows increased yield by a factor of 3.7 relative to historical hydrology. Managing desired components of discharge variance will lead to greater efficiency in the Lower Mekong Basin food system. © 2017, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

AB  - The impacts of climate on health and wellbeing occur in time and space and through a range of indirect, complicated mechanisms. This diversity of pathways has major implications for national public health planning and influence on interventions that might help to mitigate and adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions, nationally and internationally. This paper draws upon evidence from public health and adverse impact studies across climate science, hydrology, agriculture, public health, and the social sciences. It presents a conceptual model to support decision-making by recognizing both the proximal and distal pathways from climate-induced environmental change to national health and wellbeing. The proximal and distal pathways associated with food security, migration and mobility illustrate the diverse climate change influences in different geographic locations over different timescales. We argue that greater realization and articulation of proximal and distal pathways should radically alter how climate change is addressed as a national and international public health challenge. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Potato is a major global crop that has an important role to play in food security, reducing poverty and improving human nutrition. Enhanced atmospheric CO2 concentrations provide an opportunity to increase potato yields in the future, but this will only be possible if the potato crop can cope with the other consequences of climate change caused by this rise in CO2. While climate change may impact biotic stress either positively or negatively, abiotic stresses are likely to be greatly increased and become a major threat to potato production. Increasing heat, drought and salinity stress will drive the need for greater understanding of genes, traits and management techniques that allow potato to cope with these stresses. In this review, we identify some of the key physiological and molecular adaptations of potato to these stresses and propose an ideotype which should include (1) optimal stomatal regulation to balance water loss and heat stress in leaves, (2) production of metabolites and transporters to scavenge reactive oxygen species and partition toxic elements, (3) enhanced root systems to maximise water capture, (4) maintenance of tuberisation under stress conditions and (5) stress avoidance by accelerating crop development and reducing time to yield. We discuss potential ways to achieve this ideotype, emphasising the need to benefit from genetic diversity in landrace and wild material by screening for traits in combined stress environments appropriate to future agroecosystems. © 2018, European Association for Potato Research.

AB  - To deal with the global and regional issues including food security, climate change, land degradation, biodiversity loss, water resource management, and ecosystem health, detailed accurate spatial soil information is urgently needed. This drives the worldwide development of digital soil mapping. In recent years, significant progresses have been made in different aspects of digital soil mapping. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a review for the major progresses of digital soil mapping in the last decade. First, we briefly described the rise of digital soil mapping and outlined important milestones and their influence, and main paradigms in digital soil mapping. Then, we reviewed the progresses in legacy soil data, environmental covariates, soil sampling, predictive models and the applications of digital soil mapping products. Finally, we summarized the main trends and future prospect as revealed by studies up to now. We concluded that although the digital soil mapping is now moving towards mature to meet various demands of soil information, challenges including new theories, methodologies and applications of digital soil mapping, especially for highly heterogeneous and human-affected environments, still exist and need to be addressed in the future. © 2017 CAAS.

AB  - The possible disruption of climate change (CC) on the ecological, economic and social segments of human interest has made this phenomenon a major issue over the last couple of decades. Mountains are fragile ecosystems, projected to endure a higher impact from the increased warming. This study presents modelled CC projections with respect to the suitability for the growth of nine near-treeline plant species of the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau through niche modelling technique using CLIMEX and estimates their potential future distribution and the extent of greening in the region. Two global climate models, CSIRO-MK 3.0 (CS) and MIROCH-H (MR) were used under IPCC A1B and A2 emission scenarios for the year 2050 and 2100. The results indicate that climatic suitability of the nine species expands towards higher elevations into areas that are currently unsuitable while currently suitable areas in many regions become climatically unsuitable in the future. The total climatically suitable area for the nine species at current time is around 1.09 million km2, with an additional 0.68 and 0.35 million km2 becoming suitable by 2050 and 2100 respectively. High elevation belts, especially those lying above 3500 m, will see more climatically suitable areas for the nine species in the future. Cold stress is the main factor limiting current distribution and its decrease will affect the overall expansion of climatic suitability in the region. Impacts on nature conservation and water and food security could be expected from such shift of climatic suitability in the region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As the world's third largest delta and one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots, the Mekong Delta provides both ecological and food security for its inhabitants. Nevertheless, the delta has been threatened by climate change and human activities, particularly the proliferation of hydropower development across the Mekong Basin since the 1990s. However, compared to the well-studied Holocene Mekong Delta, our understanding of the recent 50-year evolution of the Mekong Delta is not sufficient to address these threats. In this study, we used 43-year Landsat images from 1973 to 2015 to investigate the entirety of the Mekong Delta's shoreline, land area and geomorphological changes. We compiled a new and comprehensive GIS database of the dams and irrigations of the Mekong Basin. The goal was to improve our knowledge of the recent evolution of the Mekong Delta and to link the potential impacts of dams and other factors. Our results show that the Mekong Delta is experiencing a significant decrease in the shoreline progradation rate. Currently, 66% of the entire delta shoreline is under erosion. The erosion segments are mainly located on the eastern side of the Ca Mau Peninsula and northwestern side of the delta in the Gulf of Thailand (GoT). Most parts of the shorelines in the estuarine area are still growing, although river sediment continues to decrease. Geomorphological asymmetries, discontinuous shoreline shifts, and sandy beach-ridge sets can be observed in multitemporal images. The entire Mekong Delta experienced a shift from growing to shrinking around 2005 with the gradual increase of the total accumulated installed capacity of the dams over the entire river basin. In the near future, the realization of planned dams, extension of irrigation, groundwater withdrawal, uncontrolled riverbed mining, delta subsidence, sea level rise, and other factors will accelerate the ongoing delta erosion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate variability and trends have significant environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Global challenges such as food security, biodiversity loss, water scarcity and human health are affected by reference evapotranspiration, temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation together, but nonlinear dynamics of these four climatic factors have not been assessed simultaneously at the national scale. This leads to unclear climatic dynamics and limited applications. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed the daily variability and trends of four climatic factors (reference evapotranspiration, temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation) in China simultaneously using high spatial resolution data from 1960 to 2013. The results indicate that the daily variability of climate system dynamics (quantified by multiplying fractal dimensions of the four climatic factors) in north China was higher than that in south China. For example, the climate system dynamics were more chaotic and with higher nonlinear variation in north China, most notably in Heilongjiang Province, the major grain base of China, posing threats to food security in the context of growing national population. Spatial distribution of variability varies among different climatic factors. Our study highlights the need for a more holistic study of climate variability and trends in other countries with multiple climate types to address challenges of sustainable development. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - World's population is projected to reach 9.7 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. To meet the food demands of the exponentially increasing population, a massive food production is necessary. Agricultural production on land and aquatic systems pose negative impacts on the earth's ecosystems. Combined effects of climate change, land degradation, cropland losses, water scarcity and species infestations are major causes for loss of agricultural yields up to 25%. Therefore, the world needs a paradigm shift in agriculture development for sustainable food production and security through green revolution and eco-friendly approaches. Hence, agriculture practices must be sustained by the ability of farm land to produce food to satisfy human needs indefinitely as well as having sustainable impacts on the broader environment. The real agricultural challenges of the future as well as for today differ according to their geopolitical and socioeconomic contexts. Therefore, sustainable agriculture must be inclusive and have adaptability and flexibility over time to respond to demands for food production. Considering all these points, this book has been prepared to address and insights to generate awareness of food security and focuses on perspectives of sustainable food production and security towards human society. The book facilitates to describes the classical and recent advancement of technologies and strategies by sustainable way through plant and animal origin including, breeding, pest management, tissue culture, transgenic techniques, bio and phytoremediation, environmental stress and resistance, plant growth enhancing microbes, bio-fertilizer and integrated approaches of food nutrition. Chapters provide a new dimension to discuss the issues, challenges and strategies of agricultural sustainability in a comprehensive manner. It aims at educating the students, advanced and budding researchers to develop novel approaches for sustainability with environmentally sound practices. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

AB  - The food system is a major source of environmental impact, and dietary change has been recommended as an important and necessary strategy to reduce this impact. However, assessing the environmental performance of diets is complex due to the many types of foods eaten and the diversity of agricultural production systems and local environmental settings. To assess the state of science and identify knowledge gaps, an integrative review of the broad topic of environment and diet was undertaken, with particular focus on the completeness of coverage of environmental concerns and the metrics used. Compared with the 14 discrete environmental areas of concern identified in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the located journal literature mainly addressed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and, to a lesser extent, land and water use. Some relevant concerns were rarely addressed or not addressed at all. In the case of GHG emissions, changes in land use and soil carbon stocks were seldom considered. This represents a disconnect between the science informing strategic climate action in the agricultural sector and the science informing public health nutrition. In the case of land and water use, few studies used metrics that are appropriate in a life-cycle context. Some metrics produce inherently biased results, which misinform about environmental impact. The limited evidence generally points to recommended diets having lower environmental impacts than typical diets, although not in every case. This is largely explained by the overconsumption of food energy associated with average diets, which is also a major driver of obesity. A shared-knowledge framework is identified as being needed to guide future research on this topic. Until the evidence base becomes more complete, commentators on sustainable diets should not be quick to assume that a dietary strategy to reduce overall environmental impact can be readily defined or recommended. © 2017 American Society for Nutrition.

AB  - Shrimp-rice farming practices in the coastal areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal, India are reviewed. It is apparent that this integrated aquaculture-agriculture system is suited to environmental and hydrological conditions found in specific areas. Production strategies devised by farmers demonstrate that the diversified culture of shrimp with rice is technically feasible. Shrimp-rice agroecosystems exhibit several synergistic effects between systems components that result in efficient resource use and enhanced production, whilst avoiding negative environmental impacts. Integrated cropping enhances agrobiodiversity and reduces dependence on external inputs (agrochemicals, feed and fertiliser). Diversified shrimp-rice culture produces a valuable export crop, stimulating economic development and staple cereal, fish and vegetable crops that enhance human nutrition and food security. The contribution that diversified shrimp-rice agroecosystems make to social-ecological resilience is evaluated using the DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, State, Impacts, Responses) framework. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) associated with prevailing practices are reviewed using the SWOT framework. We conclude, that with appropriate safeguards, diversified shrimp-rice agroecosystems could contribute to climate change adaptation and enhance production from land affected by salinization. Policy-support and practical action is needed to support and promote diversified shrimp-farming agroecosystems as they can contribute to social-ecological resilience in vulnerable coastal communities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Global demands for agricultural produce will increase up to 70% by the next two decades. To meet this goal, the productivity of crops needs to be increased under harsher climate conditions and with declining soil and water quality. In addition to this, widespread emergence of new pathogens and pests is posing a serious threat to agricultural produce. Plant-microbe interactions may have a beneficial, neutral, or negative effect on one or both partners. The whole world needs to address climate change scenario, by enabling agriculture to adopt climate-friendly practices. Plants host a rich microbiota, which supports plants in nutrition uptake and health management. Phytomicrobiome represents a great reservoir, which can be harnessed to improve the productivity of crops and food quality. A systematic research focused on the understanding of structure and function of phytomicrobiome driven by crop management and environmental factors is critical for devising reliable strategies to improve crop health and productivity in a sustainable way, by reducing chemical inputs and emissions of greenhouse gases. Microbial diversity associated with plants is highly underestimated, as the data generated by next-generation sequencing technologies have exhibited that only a small portion of microorganisms could be cultivated until now. Recently, the high-throughput microbial cultivation approach "culturomics" in conjunction with high-speed and low-cost identification technique based on MALDI-TOF MS has offered an opportunity to cultivate the not-yet-cultivated microorganisms and harness them to manipulate the crop phytomicrobiome. In this chapter, we discussed various aspects of phytomicrobiome, like beneficial and harmful effects of its members and colonization in rhizosphere and phyllosphere. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

AB  - Climate change-induced abiotic stresses are considered as notable threat to world food security affecting crop, livestock, and fisheries production which are all fundamental for sustainable development of human life. Impact of climate variability affecting water availability, nutrient levels, soil moisture, temperature, and tropical ozone in crop yield is measured in various studies. Rice, the critical crop in maintaining food security, has high vulnerability to increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events which affects crop growth at macro- and microenvironment. Meanwhile, rising temperatures and consequent rise in sea level can make farming riskier by increasing salinity in the cultivatable lands. Decrease in productivity of rice is mainly related to extreme environmental conditions such as water deficit, high temperature, submergence, salinity, cold, and accumulation of heavy metals apart from higher incidence of pathogens and pests. Crop germplasm, wild relatives, and other species serve as main genetic sources for tolerance. These can be useful in crop breeding as they have had adaptation and acclimation responses developed through natural selection process. Hence, identification of genetic loci, mechanism, and signaling path ways provides a paradigm to improve yield under diverse ecosystem. By using marker- assisted selection, beneficial alleles from wild relatives can be introgressed to develop climate-ready rice varieties. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

AB  - Climate change is reshaping the way in which contaminants move through the global environment, in large part by changing the chemistry of the oceans and affecting the physiology, health, and feeding ecology of marine biota. Climate change-associated impacts on structure and function of marine food webs, with consequent changes in contaminant transport, fate, and effects, are likely to have significant repercussions to those human populations that rely on fisheries resources for food, recreation, or culture. Published studies on climate change–contaminant interactions with a focus on food web bioaccumulation were systematically reviewed to explore how climate change and ocean acidification may impact contaminant levels in marine food webs. We propose here a conceptual framework to illustrate the impacts of climate change on contaminant accumulation in marine food webs, as well as the downstream consequences for ecosystem goods and services. The potential impacts on social and economic security for coastal communities that depend on fisheries for food are discussed. Climate change–contaminant interactions may alter the bioaccumulation of two priority contaminant classes: the fat-soluble persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), as well as the protein-binding methylmercury (MeHg). These interactions include phenomena deemed to be either climate change dominant (i.e., climate change leads to an increase in contaminant exposure) or contaminant dominant (i.e., contamination leads to an increase in climate change susceptibility). We illustrate the pathways of climate change–contaminant interactions using case studies in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean. The important role of ecological and food web modeling to inform decision-making in managing ecological and human health risks of chemical pollutants contamination under climate change is also highlighted. Finally, we identify the need to develop integrated policies that manage the ecological and socioeconomic risk of greenhouse gases and marine pollutants. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Land use change is the main driving force of global environmental change and is considered as very central to the ongoing debate on sustainable development. Even though large volume of literature materials is available of land use/land cover (LU/LC) change for many areas, very little is known of it in the floodplain of the Sokoto Rima River Basin of Nigeria despite the basin’s strategic importance. Thus, this study characterized the basin’s LU/LC and its change using computer-based digital classification of near-anniversary Landsat 5 TM imagery of November 23, 1998, and Landsat 8 OLI of December 2, 2013. The results of the digital classification were complimented with field-based observations on major observable characteristics of every LU/LC identified. Thirteen classes (forest area, dense grassland, grassy fallow, grazed open grassland, open cultivation, open grain fallow farmland, pepper cultivation, rice farmland, scrubland, sugarcane farmland, dry bare land, sand deposit and wetland/water) were characterized and the nature and extent of their changes assessed. 40 % of the basin’s uses is under cultivation, 22 % is under fallow, 27 % is either degraded or non-cultivable, while 11 % is forested. Change events include forest loss, increase in area cultivated, expansion of shrub/scrubland and pervasiveness of grazing. The changes were more pronounced in the upper than either the central and southern segments of the basin. In general LU/LC changes in the basin are reflection of increased human population pressure and effects of climate change. The LU/LC patterns and changes suggest underutilization and mismanagement of the floodplain which have impact on soil, hydrology and biodiversity with serious implication for livelihood and food security. The study recommends that interventions are needed to promote enhanced and sustainable management of land, water and vegetation resources in the basin, with particular emphasis on empowering the local land users to participate actively toward sustainable management of the floodplain. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - An important challenge for conserving and managing marine ecosystems is to advance our understanding of how multiple human stressors, environmental factors and marine resources interact and influence each other. The ecosystems of the Israeli Mediterranean coast have undergone significant ecological changes in recent decades, caused primarily by the introduction of alien species, fishing and the warming of the waters. Here we used a food-web model representing the continental shelf of the Israeli Mediterranean coast to explore the historical dynamics of the area considering the combined effect of alien species, fishing activities and changes in sea surface temperature and primary productivity. The food-web model was fitted to available time series of data from the early 1990s to 2010 using the temporal dynamic module of the Ecopath with Ecosim modeling approach. An important challenge was to model the numerous alien species inhabiting the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, one of the most invaded marine ecosystems of the world. Historical model simulations satisfactorily matched observed data, especially regarding alien groups. However, lack of data from the pelagic environment limited our ability to compare model output with historical observations. Trophic interactions, climate change and fishing were important factors explaining the historical dynamics of the ecosystem, which showed a degradation pattern over time. Results also highlighted an increasing proportion of alien species in biomass and catch over time, with important effects on the food web. This study represents an important step forward in understanding the changes that are occurring in the Israeli continental shelf ecosystem and the Levantine Sea. © Inter-Research 2017.

AB  - Ensuring water, food and energy security for a growing world population represents a 21st century catchment management challenge. Failure to recognise the complexity of interactions across ecosystem service provision can risk the loss of other key environmental and socioeconomic benefits from the natural capital of catchment systems. In particular, the ability of soil and water to meet human needs is undermined by uncertainties around climate change effects, ecosystem service interactions and conflicting stakeholder interests across catchments. This critical review draws from an extensive literature to discuss the benefits and challenges of utilising an ecosystem service approach for integrated catchment management (ICM). State-of-the-art research on ecosystem service assessment, mapping and participatory approaches is evaluated and a roadmap of the key short- and longer-term research needs for maximising landscape-scale ecosystem service provision from catchments is proposed. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Soil is the medium for plant growth and the substrate for all biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes. Soil’s unique natural organization forms the foundation of any food–water–energy nexus system. It forms a habitat for billions of diverse micro, meso, and macrofauna and flora and is the basis of numerous ecosystem services essential to human well-being and nature conservancy. It moderates soil hydrological processes within the entire vadose zone: which is part of the earth between the soil surface and the phreatic zone. Soil structure also supports numerous ecosystem services including nutrient transformation and availability, water quality and renewability, denaturing and transport of pollutants, and groundwater table fluctuations. It also moderates the soil–water–plant-energy nexus with the replenishement of green-water supply (from precipitation) for plants and soil biota, which in turn enables the production of biomass as a source of food, feed, fiber, and biofuel feedstock. Indeed, soil is a very large reservoir for water and carbon with strong influences on local, regional, and global climate. Also, the energy factor is connected with the climate change through soil–water–food–energy nexus because of numerous interlinked pathways including gaseous emissions, energy and food production, and recycling of nutrients and water at regional, national, and global scales. Through provisioning of numerous ecosystem services, the soil–water–food–energy–climate nexus is interwoven with the ecosystem security and functioning of planet’s four ecospheres (i.e., atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and the biosphere). Therefore, the health of soil, plants, animals, people, and ecosystems is one and indivisible. Recent Findings: This interconnectivity is also the basis of the “4 per Thousand” initiative adopted by the COP21, the Climate Summit of 2015 in Paris, and “Adapting African Agriculture” (AAA) by COP22 in Morocco. Consequently, soil is not only a foundation for securing the natural resources: food, water and energy, but it is under desperate need to be integrated and appreciated in understanding the complex interconnectedness of any food, energy, water and soil system. Concentration and stock of soil organic carbon are the key soil properties that determine the physical, chemical, biological, and ecological properties and processes, and are major control of all nexuses described herein. Summary: This chapter presents a conceptual model and the role of soil as a naturally organized medium to protect global food, water, energy securities. Moreover, it elaborates on using soil as a basic nexus tool and proposes a paradigm shift in integrating soil and creating the food–energy–water–soil nexus. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Food is the most basic human needs. It is explicitly expressed in Law No. 8 of 2012 concerning food, namely “Food is a basic human need that is most important and is part of the fulfillment of human rights guaranteed in the Constitution of the Republic Indonesia 1945 as a basic component for realizing the quality of human resources.” However, there are some challenges and problems related to food availability. Globally, besides facing problems of land degradation, water, and environment, climate change led to a decrease in production and the uncertainty of the harvest. National food-related issues, one of the fundamental problems are the people’s dependence on rice as staple food. From the consumer side, the problems faced are less of food diversity in their consumption (food security white paper Indonesia 2005–5025, 2006). Using the description method, the aim of this study was to identify the consumer beliefs to the attributes of non rice-non wheat staple food non-rice non-wheat. The study found that consumers have positive belief towards the use, characteristics, and environment characteristics of non rice-non wheat staple food (non-rice non-wheat). © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

AB  - Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging, vector-borne viral zoonosis that has significantly impacted public health, livestock health and production, and food security over the last three decades across large regions of the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula. The potential for expansion of RVF outbreaks within and beyond the range of previous occurrence is unknown. Despite many large national and international epidemics, the landscape epidemiology of RVF remains obscure, particularly with respect to the ecological roles of wildlife reservoirs and surface water features. The current investigation modeled RVF risk throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula as a function of a suite of biotic and abiotic landscape features using machine learning methods. Intermittent wetland, wild Bovidae species richness and sheep density were associated with increased landscape suitability to RVF outbreaks. These results suggest the role of wildlife hosts and distinct hydrogeographic landscapes in RVF virus circulation and subsequent outbreaks may be underestimated. These results await validation by studies employing a deeper, field-based interrogation of potential wildlife hosts within high risk taxa. © 2017 Walsh et al.

AB  - Sustainability considerations should be an integral component of food security assessments. Nourishing the expected global population of nine billion in the face of fast diminishing land and water resources and looming climate change has tremendous economic, environmental, and social implications. Furthermore, whereas much past work on food security had focused on feeding the world through more staple crop calories, the current emphasis is on nourishing the global population through the provision of a more nutrient-rich diet. Hence the focus on micronutrient deficiencies (so-called 'hidden hunger'), dietary diversity, and the nutrient density of the food supply-all critical components of overall nutritional status. To aid future assessments of 'sustainable nutrition security', we need a new methodology and some novel assessment metrics and tools. Seven metrics are proposed, each based on a combination of multiple indicators, for use in characterizing sustainable nutrition outcomes of food systems: (1) nutrient adequacy of foods and diets; (2) ecosystem stability; (3) food affordability and availability; (4) sociocultural wellbeing; (5) food safety; (6) resilience; and (7) waste and loss reduction. Each of the metrics comprises multiple indicators that are combined to derive an overall score (0-100). The metrics can be combined with simulation models and then deployed by decision-makers and investors to set meaningful goals, track progress, and evaluate the potential impact of targeted food system interventions. The goal is to improve food system sustainability and resilience and to improve human nutrition and health outcomes. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Livestock farming systems perform numerous functions: besides supplying proteins for human nutrition, livestock provide income for rural populations and thus support a large part of the world’s rural communities. Livestock produce not only meat, milk, and eggs, but also wool, fibre, and leather. Herbivore farming systems shape rural territories by supporting low population densities and associated infrastructures and public services. In temperate and Mediterranean areas, grassland-based systems keep landscapes open, preserve biodiversity, and provide various ecosystem services such as climate regulation via carbon sequestration, and prevention of erosion and running fires. They also provide socio-cultural services including tourist events such as transhumance, and products with a local image and geographic link such as Protected Designation of Origin cheeses. Livestock have been integrated with cropping systems worldwide. Small multipurpose farmers who grow crops and rear animals produce most of the food supply and promote economic development in Africa, South Asia, and Latin America. Animal traction is particularly important in these farming systems where cattle, equids, and camels directly assist crop production for ploughing, planting, weeding, and water-lifting. Livestock consume crop by-products and grass from field boundaries. Herbivore dungs make good farmyard manure for crop fertilisation, being made of ‘predigested’ plant organic matter easily utilised by soil microfauna; dungs are also used as slurry associated with biogas production, for vermicompost, or are dried for burning. © 2017 by World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

AB  - The deep ocean encompasses 95% of the oceans’ volume and is the largest and least explored biome of Earth's Biosphere. New life forms are continuously being discovered. The physiological mechanisms allowing organisms to adapt to extreme conditions of the deep ocean (high pressures, from very low to very high temperatures, food shortage, lack of solar light) are still largely unknown. Some deep-sea species have very long life-spans, whereas others can tolerate toxic compounds at high concentrations; these characteristics offer an opportunity to explore the specialized biochemical and physiological mechanisms associated with these responses. Widespread symbiotic relationships play fundamental roles in driving host functions, nutrition, health, and evolution. Deep-sea organisms communicate and interact through sound emissions, chemical signals and bioluminescence. Several giants of the oceans hunt exclusively at depth, and new studies reveal a tight connection between processes in the shallow water and some deep-sea species. Limited biological knowledge of the deep-sea limits our capacity to predict future response of deep-sea organisms subject to increasing human pressure and changing global environmental conditions. Molecular tools, sensor-tagged animals, in situ and laboratory experiments, and new technologies can enable unprecedented advancement of deep-sea biology, and facilitate the sustainable management of deep ocean use under global change. © 2017

AB  - 1. Phytobenthic communities consist of macrophytes (macroalgae, vascular plants and mosses) with their accompanying fauna and microorganisms. 2. The phytobenthic communities occur in the photic zone, which in the Baltic Sea extends from the water surface down to a 20 m water depth, but in turbid coastal waters only down to 5 m. 3. The type of vegetation is determined by the available substrate, which is a result of geography and geology in combination with currents. Most macroalgae grow attached to hard substrates whereas vascular plants and charophytes grow on sandy or soft (silt and mud) substrates. 4. Generally, the coastal areas of the Baltic Sea consist of mixed substrates with an intermingled vegetation of vascular plants and algae. In the northern Baltic Sea hard substrates dominate in the outer archipelagos, and in the southeastern Baltic Sea sandy and muddy substrates dominate. 5. Luxuriant stands of macrophytes provide food, shelter and spawning habitats for the associated sessile and mobile micro-, meio- and macrofauna, including fish. 6. On an ecosystem-wide scale, the phytobenthic communities vary along the large-scale Baltic Sea gradient. Biomass decreases with lower salinity and colder climate, while the proportion of freshwater species increases. 7. On a local scale, the phytobenthic communities are mainly, directly or indirectly, shaped by water movement (e.g. By the occurrence of sandy beaches and rocky shores) and winter ice cover. Light and substrate availability give rise to typical depth zonation patterns, ending with soft-substrate communities deepest down. 8. On a small scale (patches), phytobenthic community structure and composition is influenced by microhabitat structure and biotic interactions. 9. The phytobenthic communities in the brackish Baltic Sea are more sensitive to disturbance than their marine counterparts due to low diversity, physiological stress and the loss of sexual reproduction when species approach their salinity limit.

AB  - 1. Environmental drivers and food web structure in the pelagic zone vary from south to north in the Baltic Sea. 2. While nitrogen is generally the limiting nutrient for primary production in the Baltic Sea, phosphorus is the limiting nutrient in the Bothnian Bay. 3. In the Gulf of Bothnia the food web is to a large extent driven by terrestrial allochthonous material, while autochthonous production dominates in the other parts of the Baltic Sea. 4. Changes in bacterioplankton, protist and zooplankton community composition from south to north are mainly driven by salinity. 5. Bacteria are crucial constituents of the pelagic food web (microbial loop) and in oxygen-poor and anoxic bottom waters where they mediate element transformations. 6. Diatoms and dinoflagellates are the major primary producers in the pelagic zone. Summer blooms of diazotrophic (nitrogen-fixing) filamentous cyanobacteria are typical of the Baltic Sea, especially in the Baltic Sea proper and the Gulf of Finland. 7. The mesozooplankton (mainly copepods and cladocerans) channel energy from primary producers and the microbial food web to fish and finally to the top predators in the pelagic system (waterbirds and mammals). 8. Herring and sprat populations are affected by the foraging intensity of their main predator (cod), and therefore the environmental conditions that affect cod may also influence mesozooplankton due to food web effects "cascading down the food web". 9. Anthropogenic pressures, such as overexploitation of fish stocks, eutrophication, climate change, introduction of non-indigenous species and contamination of top predators by hazardous substances, cause changes in the pelagic food web that may have consequences for the balance and stability of the whole ecosystem.

AB  - Wetlands play important roles that benefit social-ecological systems. They are threatened by climate change and human activities, i.e., raising livestock and wildlife hunting. The latter is essential for subsistence and for the food security of rural communities. To understand the traditional uses of wildlife, we examined the use of wildlife among people living within and outside of, but close to wetlands, in the communities located in four municipalities of Veracruz, Mexico, using open-ended interviews. We also analyzed the socioeconomic factors and environmental problems associated with the use of wildlife, and how these affect food security. People, especially those living within the wetlands, use wildlife mainly for food and trade. Wildlife is mainly used as food but also as pets, ornaments and medicine. The most useful species were black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) and Meso-American slider (Trachemys venusta). People living within the wetland make more intensive use of wildlife. The main problems causing decreasing wildlife populations were water pollution, hunting practices and deforestation. Local communities were aware of the importance of wetlands, their degradation and the need to preserve them. More research focused on socioecological systems is required to address both the need for biodiversity conservation and food security. Also, good local management plans that incorporate current knowledge about key species have to be drawn up with the participation of government and scientific institutions, citizens and local stakeholders. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Salt stress reduces land and water productivity and contributes to poverty and food insecurity. Increased salinization caused by human practices and climate change is progressively reducing agriculture productivity despite escalating calls for more food. Plant responses to salt stress are well understood, involving numerous critical processes that are each controlled by multiple genes. Knowledge of the critical mechanisms controlling salt uptake and exclusion from functioning tissues, signaling of salt stress, and the arsenal of protective metabolites is advancing. However, little progress has been made in developing salt-tolerant varieties of crop species using standard (but slow) breeding approaches. The genetic diversity available within cultivated crops and their wild relatives provides rich sources for trait and gene discovery that has yet to be sufficiently utilized. Transforming this knowledge into modern approaches using genomics and molecular tools for precision breeding will accelerate the development of tolerant cultivars and help sustain food production. © Copyright 2017 by Annual Reviews.

AB  - Today’s industrial food production contributes significantly to environmental degradation. Meat production accounts for the largest impact, including greenhouse gas emissions, land and water use. While food production and consumption are important aspects when addressing climate change, this article focuses predominantly on dietary change that promotes both health for planet and people with focus on athletes. Healthy, sustainable eating recommendations begin to appear in various governmental guidelines. However, there remains resistance to the suggested reductions in meat consumption. While food citizens are likely to choose what is good for them and the planet, others may not, unless healthy eating initiatives integrate creative food literacy approaches with experiential learning as a potential vehicle for change. This concept paper is organized in three sections: (1) Environmental impact of food, (2) health and sustainability connections, and (3) application in sports and exercise. For active individuals, this article focuses on the quantity of protein, highlighting meat and dairy, and quality of food, with topics such as organic production and biodiversity. Finally, the timing of when to integrate sustainability principles in sport nutrition is discussed, followed by practical applications for education and inclusion in team, institutional, and event operations. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Coastal communities worldwide rely on small-scale artisanal fisheries as a means of increasing food security and alleviating poverty. Even small-scale fishing activities, however, are prone to resource depletion and environmental degradation, which can Erode livelihoods in the long run. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify viable and resilient artisanal fisheries, and generate knowledge to support management within the context of a rapidly changing climate. We examined the ecosystem-level consequences of an artisanal kelp fishery (Macrocystis pyrifera), finding small-scale harvest of this highly productive species poses minimal impacts on kelp recovery rates, survival, and biomass dynamics, and abundances of associated commercial and culturally important fish species. These results suggest that small-scale harvest poses minimal trade-offs for the other economic benefits provided by these ecosystems, and their inherent, spiritual, and cultural value to humans. However, we detected a negative impact of warmer seawater temperatures on kelp recovery rates following harvest, indicating that the viability of harvest, even at small scales, may be threatened by future increases in global ocean temperature. This suggests that negative impacts of artisanal fisheries may be more likely to arise in the context of a warming climate, further highlighting the widespread effects of global climate change on coastal fisheries and livelihoods. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - The benefits and ecosystem services that humans derive from the oceans are threatened by numerous global change stressors, one of which is ocean acidification. Here, we describe the effects of ocean acidification on an upwelling system that already experiences inherently low pH conditions, the California Current. We used an end-to-end ecosystem model (Atlantis), forced by downscaled global climate models and informed by a meta-analysis of the pH sensitivities of local taxa, to investigate the direct and indirect effects of future pH on biomass and fisheries revenues. Our model projects a 0.2-unit drop in pH during the summer upwelling season from 2013 to 2063, which results in wide-ranging magnitudes of effects across guilds and functional groups. The most dramatic direct effects of future pH may be expected on epibenthic invertebrates (crabs, shrimps, benthic grazers, benthic detritivores, bivalves), and strong indirect effects expected on some demersal fish, sharks, and epibenthic invertebrates (Dungeness crab) because they consume species known to be sensitive to changing pH. The model's pelagic community, including marine mammals and seabirds, was much less influenced by future pH. Some functional groups were less affected to changing pH in the model than might be expected from experimental studies in the empirical literature due to high population productivity (e.g., copepods, pteropods). Model results suggest strong effects of reduced pH on nearshore state-managed invertebrate fisheries, but modest effects on the groundfish fishery because individual groundfish species exhibited diverse responses to changing pH. Our results provide a set of projections that generally support and build upon previous findings and set the stage for hypotheses to guide future modeling and experimental analysis on the effects of OA on marine ecosystems and fisheries. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Flow regimes are fundamental to sustaining ecological characteristics of rivers worldwide, including their associated floodplains. Recent advances in understanding tropical river–floodplain ecosystems suggest that a small set of basic ecological concepts underpins their biophysical characteristics, especially the high levels of productivity, biodiversity and natural resilience. The concepts relate to (1) river-specific flow patterns, (2) processes ‘fuelled’ by a complex of locally generated carbon and nutrients seasonally mixed with carbon and nutrients from floodplains and catchments, (3) seasonal movements of biota facilitated by flood regimes, (4) food webs and overall productivity sustained by hydrological connectivity, (5) fires in the wet/dry tropical floodplains and riparian zones being major consumers of carbon and a key factor in the subsequent redistribution of nutrients, and (6) river–floodplains having inherent resilience to natural variability but only limited resilience to artificial modifications. Understanding these concepts is particularly timely in anticipating the effects of impending development that may affect tropical river–floodplains at the global scale. Australia, a region encompassing some of the last relatively undisturbed tropical riverine landscapes in the world, provides a valuable case study for understanding the productivity, diversity and resilience of tropical river–floodplain systems. However, significant knowledge gaps remain. Despite substantial recent advances in understanding, present knowledge of these highly complex tropical rivers is insufficient to predict many ecological responses to either human-generated or climate-related changes. The major research challenges identified herein (for example, those related to food web structure, nutrient transfers, productivity, connectivity and resilience), if accomplished in the next decade, will offer substantial insights toward assessing and managing ecological changes associated with human alterations to rivers and their catchments. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - In this paper, we reflect on the implications for science, policy and practice of the recently introduced concept of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS), with a focus on the European context. First, we analyse NBS in relation to similar concepts, and reflect on its relationship to sustainability as an overarching framework. From this, we derive a set of questions to be addressed and propose a general framework for how these might be addressed in NBS projects by funders, researchers, policy-makers and practitioners. We conclude that: (1) NBS need to be developed and discussed in relation to existing concepts to clarify their added value;(2) When considering and implementing NBS, the ‘relabelling’ of related concepts and the misuse of the concept have to be prevented in order to avoid misunderstanding, duplication and unintended consequences;(3) NBS as currently framed by the European Commission provides an opportunity for: a) transdisciplinary research into the design and implementation of solutions based on nature; and b) overcoming a bias towards development alternatives with narrow perspectives that focus on short-term economic gains and effectiveness;(4) The strength of the NBS concept is its integrative, systemic approach which prevents it from becoming just another “green communication tool” that provides justification for a classical model of natural resource exploitation and management measures.To realise their full potential, NBS must be developed by including the experience of all relevant stakeholders such that ‘solutions’ contribute to achieving all dimensions of sustainability. As NBS are developed, we must also moderate the expectations placed on them since the precedent provided by other initiatives whose aim was to manage nature sustainably demonstrates that we should not expect NBS to be cheap and easy, at least not in the short-term. © 2016 British Geological Survey, NERC

AB  - Surface soil moisture has a direct impact on food security, human health and ecosystem function. It also plays a key role in the climate system, and the development and persistence of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and heatwaves. However, sparse and uneven observations have made it difficult to quantify the global distribution and dynamics of surface soil moisture. Here we introduce a metric of soil moisture memory and use a full year of global observations from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive mission to show that surface soil moisture - a storage believed to make up less than 0.001% of the global freshwater budget by volume, and equivalent to an, on average, 8-mm thin layer of water covering all land surfaces - plays a significant role in the water cycle. Specifically, we find that surface soil moisture retains a median 14% of precipitation falling on land after three days. Furthermore, the retained fraction of the surface soil moisture storage after three days is highest over arid regions, and in regions where drainage to groundwater storage is lowest. We conclude that lower groundwater storage in these regions is due not only to lower precipitation, but also to the complex partitioning of the water cycle by the surface soil moisture storage layer at the land surface. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The flux of matter, energy and nutrients across ecosystems, i.e., resource subsidy, is a fundamental attribute of ecosystems, as well as one of basic research questions in ecology. Common subsidies include leaf litter and terrestrial insects that fall into waters, the adults of aquatic insects, spawning salmon. The allocthonous input of resource subsidy can influence individual organisms, populations, communities, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, such as enhancing individual growth, increasing species abundance and diversity, affecting community structure, enhancing secondary productivity, influencing food-chain length and food web. Due to increased human impacts on environments, especially at aspects of land use, climate change and invasive species, the influence of anthropogenic disturbance on cross-ecosystem resource subsidies will be intensified at both spacial and temporary scales, so that ecosystems will face severer threats. Accordingly, future ecological researches in this field should emphasize the following aspects: impacts of single and multiple stressors on subsidies and ecosystems, implementation of dynamic resource subsidies on ecosystem restoration and management, the dark sides of subsidy relating with pollutants, and basic ecological research on cross-ecosystem resource subsidy in tropics and sub-tropics, as well in China. © 2017, Science Press.

AB  - The Himalaya represents a vast mountain system and globally valued for its significant role in regulation of global as well as regional climate that has direct impact on biodiversity and ecosystem services crucial for sustenance of millions of people in Himalaya and adjoining areas. However, mountain regions worldwide are impacted by climate change and at the same time represent distinctive area for the assessment of climate related impacts. Climate change impacts in Himalayan region have its implications on food production, natural ecosystems, retreat of glacier, water supply, human and animal health and overall human well being. The livelihood and food security of the people inhabited in region largely depend on climate sensitive sectors i.e. agriculture, livestock, forestry and their interlinkages with each other, and has the potential to break down food and nutritional security as well as livelihood support systems. People’s perception and understanding of climate can be an important asset when it comes to adaptation to climate change impact; however it is not taken into consideration for the development of policy design and implementation of modern mitigation and adaptation strategies by governments and other civil society organizations. The knowledge of local people and farming communities for rural landscape management and sustainable use of bioresources is gaining credence as a key strategy to cope up with the climate change. Therefore, the present study analyzes the indigenous knowledge of local people and their perceptions on climate change, and also documented adaptation approaches at local level in mountain ecosystem of western Himalaya. The study could be useful to policy makers to design appropriate adaptation strategies to cope up with the impacts of climate change. © 2017, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The global land system is facing unprecedented pressures from growing human populations and climatic change. Understanding the effects these pressures may have is necessary to designing land management strategies that ensure food security, ecosystem service provision and successful climate mitigation and adaptation. However, the number of complex, interacting effects involved makes any complete understanding very difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, the recent development of integrated modelling frameworks allows for the exploration of the co-development of human and natural systems under scenarios of global change, potentially illuminating the main drivers and processes in future land system change. Here, we use one such integrated modelling framework (the CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment Platform) to investigate the range of projected outcomes in the European land system across climatic and socio-economic scenarios for the 2050s. We find substantial consistency in locations and types of change even under the most divergent conditions, with results suggesting that climate change alone will lead to a contraction in the agricultural and forest area within Europe, particularly in southern Europe. This is partly offset by the introduction of socioeconomic changes that change both the demand for agricultural production, through changing food demand and net imports, and the efficiency of agricultural production. Simulated extensification and abandonment in the Mediterranean region is driven by future decreases in the relative profitability of the agricultural sector in southern Europe, owing to decreased productivity as a consequence of increased heat and drought stress and reduced irrigation water availability. The very low likelihood (< 33% probability) that current land use proportions in many parts of Europe will remain unchanged suggests that future policy should seek to promote and support the multifunctional role of agriculture and forests in different European regions, rather than focusing on increased productivity as a route to agricultural and forestry viability. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - This paper introduces an EU Horizon 2020 project (MAGIC) being conducted between 2016 and 2020 to better understand how EU water, food, energy and biodiversity policies are linked together and to EU climate and sustainability goals. The research is thus another instance of a nexus study in which various forms of research-derived and other knowledge are combined to evaluate and improve policy and other decision-making. The project is shaped by insights on the conduct and evaluation of inter- and transdisciplinary research for policy support reported through the MODSIM and iEMSs conferences in recent years. MAGIC brings together, from multiple centres, expertise in biophysical, computational, economic and social sciences underpinned by theories of transdisciplinary science-for-governance. These MAGIC consortium partners also have experience of treading the fine line between challenging policies (which may be defended by vested interests) and supporting processes of policy reform (whose impetus and legitimacy rely on generating communities of interest). The key challenges for MAGIC are whether this breadth and depth of expertise can be combined in ways that are theoretically rigorous, practical within the resources available and deliver more than the sum of its parts, that is, with discernible impact beyond the science-policy interface (i.e. outwith academia). The integrative core of the project is Quantitative Story Telling (QST), a process of making quality tests of the narratives that underlie or justify key policy positions. The qualities of the policy narratives assessed are their feasibility (within biophysical limits), viability (within the existing institutional context) and desirability (reflecting distributional and acceptability issues); using uses reformulations of existing statistical datasets and simple empirical transformations. The analysis is framed using a societal metabolism metaphor. That is, it focuses on the funds of land and human time needed to create the flows of materials, energy and money that reproduce and maintain the identity of the system of interest (e.g. current patterns and trajectories of consumption). The analysis is conducted simultaneously across scales (geographical or classificatory) to highlight key externalisation effects and dependencies that may undermine long-term security. This quantitative testing of narratives is preceded and shaped by critical choices made by both policy stakeholders and the research team. Which narratives should we focus on? How should we explore these with our social metabolism analysis? Different stakeholders and team members may all have different preferences and epistemological positions. Failure to acknowledge, and where possible resolve, such fundamental differences could limit potential for impact by ensuring that researchers and policy makers have no shared issue framing. For MAGIC, there is thus a strong focus on, and investment in, using social science methods to understand the actors, framing and institutional context within which the QST is conducted and any outputs are used. Deliberative and inclusive processes (undertaking the research in mixed-teams of researchers and stakeholders) are being used to legitimise the process of analysis and ensure that the outputs of QST are salient and credible. The paper concludes by reflecting on how well the expertise developed by the authors in conducting policy support translates from the particular context of Scotland into the structures, processes and procedures of the EU. © 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

AB  - The climate change impacts are felt by all facets and sectors of ecosystems, covering flora, fauna and environment. Sri Lanka is considered as a vulnerable, small island country that is under serious threat from climate change impacts. The most profound impacts of climate change in Sri Lanka will be on agriculture and food security, water and coastal resources, biodiversity changes, and human health. Sri Lanka’s biodiversity is significantly important both on a regional and global scale as it has the highest species density for flowering plants, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Sri Lanka’s varied ecosystems provide many services that are of significant economic value and play a crucial role in providing goods and ecosystem services. The subsequent sections featuring specific aspects of biodiversity in forests, freshwater wetlands, coastal and marine systems and agricultural systems, provide greater detail on the ecosystem services and bio-resources. Habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive alien species, deforestation and forest degradation, development projects, environmental pollutions and climate change (global warming) are the major threats to the biodiversity of the country. Climate change impacts on environment lead to a reduction in the distribution and abundance of species, especially endemics, which may even result in their global extinction. The introduction of various policies and guidelines in relation to environment is a good sign for conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity. The government of Sri Lanka has been implementing various environmental projects aiming at reducing deforestation and degradation of ecosystems. Policies and measures already developed under such initiatives will no doubt preserve natural habitats for plant and animal species. However, being a developing country with many economic challenges, the funds and expertise available for monitoring climate change impacts and biodiversity conservation are not sufficient. © 2017, Fund for Support and Development of Protected Areas "Bear Land".

AB  - The Ramsar Convention was agreed in 1971 between 18 nations, and now has contracting parties from all regions of the world. The potential services related to ecosystem and human health primarily cover supply of water, food, nutrition, and medicine, purification of waste products, and buffering against adverse flooding and climate effects. The review shows that the Convention and the Ramsar network of important wetlands (currently 1500 sites of more than 100 million ha) is evidently playing a major role in relation to the provision of these services. However, examples are given showing that the benefits of wetland conservation for human and ecosystem health are often, due to lack of documentation, oversimplified. It is further shown that the Ramsar network in its current form and with the available data and documentation may be inefficient in providing the health services. This relates especially to the underrepresentation of several wetland types, the poor definition of boundaries, evidence of divergences between conservation and environmental protection targets in nutrient-limited coastal waters, assessments of tolerance threshold values for toxic substances for the various types of wetland communities, and the importance of the wetlands in the Ramsar network for groundwater and their flood buffering potential. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Drought represents a new kind of natural disaster for human society. Climate change impacts, drought, cyclone, floods, and other natural calamities are critical environmental issues receiving much analysis and discussion. The social development, civilization, agricultural cropping patterns, and settlement development are totally dependent on green nature, water availability, and their management. All types of management are dependent on proper policies and good governance. Soil development and fertility improvement are dependent on the water supply and the quality of surface and ground water storage. In cold climatic regions, the last two decades have witnessed growing water stress, both in terms of scarcity and the deterioration of quality. Similar characteristics have appeared in the tropical and subtropical regions. It has estimated that by 2020, the use and reuse is expected to increase by 40%, and 17% more water will be required for food production to meet the needs of the growing population. It is also indicated that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in regions with absolute water scarcity; about two out of three people in the world could be living under water, agriculture, and natural resource stress. The environmental calamities are extending the rush actions; the drought is one of the regular natural calamities seen in different parts of the world as well in Bangladesh and Brazil. The drought impact is a threat for agricultural food production, and less food production is a result of food and nutritional insecurity. Therefore, sustainable use of agricultural practices, which would also embrace the water, soil, forest, air, oil, gas, and petroleum mining sectors, needs to be considered within a strategic 522management approach regarding food production. The above mentioned approaches are probable factors in the management of urban and rural regions for the protection of landscapes and ecosystems as well as agricultural food production. Primary evaluation indicates that, for an increased utilization of natural resources, which are continuously happening in all over the world, as a result that could be a threat for future food security and the sustainability of natural resources. The use of modern engineering technology for agricultural practices and natural resources requires guidelines within the present drought, water scarcity, and environmentally harsh conditions. The innovation of a modern approach and climate smart agricultural and nutritional policies would be the best solution globally for protecting traditional agro products and ensure food security. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Natural infrastructure supports large parts of the rural communities in northern Ghana through the generation of ecosystem services that it provides. The provisioning of ecosystem services is a function of the seasonal nature of the climate in northern Ghana. Natural infrastructure enables food provision, which translates into food security and generates income through the year while providing an important safety net during the dry season. Rainfall is concentrated in the period from May to September followed by a long dry season. The river, responding to the climate, shows similar seasonality, flooding large parts of land during the rainy season and drying up during the dry season. Natural water infrastructure supporting riparian communities, such as headwater catchments, wetlands and seasonal floodplains, is affected by water resource development decisions. This study investigated the dependence of three riparian communities on ecosystem services in northern Ghana. In particular, the role of natural water infrastructure in supporting these ecosystem services. Participatory mapping and ranking exercises in gender-segregated groups were used to elicit information on the communities' livelihoods. The riparian communities are dependent on five types of natural infrastructure: forest reserves, shrubs and woodlands, riparian ponds, the White Volta River and floodplains. Different ecosystem services are derived from natural infrastructure and these enable livelihood activities. The most important activities are farming, fishing, livestock watering and grazing, and collection of wild fruits and vegetables, as well as provision of water for domestic use. The major ecosystem service-based activities (agriculture - 95% participation, fishing - 70% and livestock keeping - 87%) are dependent on the seasonal flows of the White Volta River. Floods occur annually between July and September depositing fertile soils on the riverbanks and increasing soil moisture content that supports floodrecession agriculture. The flooding also fills riparian ponds, restocking them with water and fish. Residual moisture in the soils around the ponds enables grass and reed growth, which supports livestock grazing on the floodplains during the dry season and provides raw materials for weaving. During the lean season, at the end of the dry season, when limited income is generated from agriculture, other food and income sources support the communities. The protected forest and the woodlands that are not directly dependent on the river flow provide biomass for energy (firewood or charcoal for direct consumption or selling) as well as wild foods (shea nuts and dawadawa fruit) that contribute to the communities' coping strategy during the lean season. The traditional fishing regime of the ponds is managed in a way that ensures maximum income is generated from fishing at a crucial time of the year. Fishing is restricted until the end of the dry season, ensuring that fish grow to a reasonable size. The fish are then caught by both male and female members of the communities. Provision of ecosystem services is under pressure due to climatic and other anthropogenic changes. For example, delays in the start of the rainy season are affecting rainfed agricultural activities on the floodplains. Delayed planting on the floodplains results in damage to, or loss of, crops as floods arrive before the harvest. Unsustainable natural resource management, related to over-abstraction of resources from the forests, shrubs and woodlands, reduces ecosystem service provision in the long run. Moreover, the Bagré Dam in Burkina Faso, built upstream of the communities, has impacted the natural river flow both positively and negatively for the communities. It currently provides dryseason flow, which is used by the communities for dry-season irrigation and for domestic purposes when other sources of water (boreholes) have dried up. However, in the past, the Bagré Dam has been forced to release emergency spills for dam safety reasons at the end of the wet season. This has washed out crops and caused loss of human lives in downstream Ghana. The planned Pwalugu Dam (with a larger storage capacity than the Bagré Dam) may, depending on the final operations, increase baseflow and also affect the flooding regime of the White Volta River, potentially reducing flood-dependent ecosystem services. We, therefore, recommend that operations of the Pwalugu Dam should take into consideration releasing sufficiently large flood flows that support ecosystem services while minimizing the release of large damaging floods. © 2012, by IWMI.

AB  - The first two decades of the twenty-first century have been marked by a growing acceptance, both by politicians and by the public at large, of the need to focus on scientific research that can tackle the global problems facing humankind. In 2009 Professor John Beddington, then the UK government’s chief scientific advisor, brought these issues to public attention by talking of a ‘perfect storm’ resulting from shortages of food, energy and water. Professor Beddington predicted that this storm would arise in 2030, based on data suggesting that global population would rise by 33 per cent, demand for water by 30 per cent and demand for food and energy by 50 per cent. It is both a challenge and a privilege for botanic gardens to be in a position to support scientific research that aims to mitigate some of these problems. Our aim in this chapter is to provide insight into how the maintenance, development and use of a living collection of diverse plant species can help in the development of solutions to some of the major problems facing the world in the twenty-first century. To tackle this question, we set out two key global challenges, those of global food security and global fuel security, and discuss the collection-driven research-oriented roles that botanic gardens can play in their solutions. Global Food Security For the last few years there has been a growing recognition that many of the solutions to the problems the world faces in feeding an ever-growing human population will lie in plant science. Global food security is thought to be at risk as a result of a combination of trends, including increases in population size and wealth, reductions in improvement in crop yields, the impact of climate change on land availability, and conflicts with demands to set land aside either to produce biofuels or to maintain biodiversity and store carbon. The world’s population continues to grow in size, demanding more food. The human population reached 6 billion in 2000, 7 billion in 2015, and is predicted to hit 8 billion by 2025 and 9-9.5 billion by 2050, after which population growth is expected to level off to some extent (UCSB, 2015). © Cambridge University Press 2017.

AB  - The Royal Zoological Society of NSW forum on the value of protected areas for fauna conservation, held in Sydney in November 2014, comprised a series of papers interlaced with a series of plenary discussions, which can be read in full in this theme edition of Australian Zoologist. The forum was a parallel event to the IUCN World Parks Congress on protected areas, also held in Sydney in the week following the forum. One outcome of the IUCN Congress was the inspirational statement entitled 'Promise of Sydney', which included a call to invest "in nature's solutions, supported by public policy, incentives, tools and safeguards that help to halt biodiversity loss, mitigate and respond to climate change, reduce the risk and impact of disasters, improve food and water security, and promote human health and dignity". The papers and plenary discussions in this RZS NSW forum all foreshadowed this vision as it applies to protected areas. Our focus in this theme edition of Australian Zoologist is on conserving fauna in Australia, and in protected areas in particular. Our concern is not so much whether we are on the right track as a society in establishing and managing protected areas, but that we are going too slowly, much too slowly, if our aim is to ensure the survival of our fauna. © 2018 Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales.

AB  - Climate change refers to a paradigm shift in the climatic pattern of a location, region or planet which is linked with average weather components, such as temperature, wind patterns and precipitations. Climate change results in erratic events such as rising global temperature, intensified drought, flooding, cyclones, low or poor agricultural productivity, loss of biodiversity and shifting of seasons. Natural processes such as variations in the intensity of the sun, eruptions from volcanoes, very slow changes in ocean circulations and land surfaces can cause this global climate change but human activities are by far the major causes through the continuous release of greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere, by altering land surfaces, and or depleting the ozone layer. The most environmentally conservative response to climate change mitigation would be to stop the consumption of fossil fuels and production of methane and chlorofluorocarbons; but these options may not be feasible until alternative technologies emanate. Considering the large amounts of carbon accumulated as biomass in plantations, extensive planting of trees, which posses large canopies that are able to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, could help mitigate the rising atmospheric CO2 levels. The roles of plantations in mitigating global climate change are related, but not limited to the following: the influence of trees on the hydrologic cycle, the barrier against destructive windstorm and desertification, conservation of the soil surface against erosion and intense heat, binding action of the dense root system, sustainable biodiversity, provision of renewable and bioenergy, nutritious food, employment, and rural income, and the reservoir of sequestered carbon. There is an urgent need to properly integrate trees and plantations in our agricultural systems, homes, institutions, markets, parks and other public places. This would not only help to reduce the build-up of carbondioxide and other atmospheric impurities but also increase the produce from plantation crops in a locality thereby mitigating against food insecurity and poverty.

AB  - Water sustains life, the environment and development. Human rights to water, as water is becoming a commodity threatens the poor. Global water crisis in term of quantity and quality is a man-made disaster linked to environmental imbalance and degradation of the life-support ecosystem. It is a crisis of water management, fragmented institutions, inadequate policies and legal systems, lack of political will, and a widening gap between science and policy making at the national, regional and global levels. Already one third of the world population is living in water-scarce or water-short areas. Climate change will accelerate the figure to one-half. 12% of the world’s population uses 85% of its fresh water. And water supply resources are being stretched to their limits. By 2050 an additional three billion people will be born mostly in countries already suffering from water shortage. According to the IPCC-Nov 2014 report, the world’s electricity must be produced from zero carbon sources by 2050; otherwise, our planet faces irreversible damage. The report says renewables have to grow from 30% share of the power sector to 80%. And all fossil fuel generation without carbon capture and storage (CCS) has to be phased out by 2100. Global warming is unequivocally linked to human interference in the ecosystem, causing glaciers to melt on the polar ice caps resulting in the rise of sea level flooding of agricultural coastal areas. The Nile delta, which is the food basket of Egypt housing 46 million people, may disappear. Coastal fresh water aquifers may be flooded by seeping seawater threatening food security of many large regions of the world. With the advent of climate change, most of water stressed areas particularly in arid and semi-arid zones (Middle East and MENA regions) will face a rainfall decline of 20% and a temperature rise of 2-3 °C that would result in large losses of water resources, basic food, basic needs, and increased poverty. Water science is a “must” in developing a unique water management scheme. It contributes to well-defined policies for efficiency, sound strategy and sustainable plans of action. There is unlimited potential with what science can do on our planet, where salt water and fresh water comprise 97.5% and 2.5% of planet waters, respectively. With 70% of waters tied in polar caps, only 30% is left in rivers, lakes and ground waters to humanity. Food production accounts for 70% of water used in the world. Through the efficient use of water by renewables for desalination, recycling water for agriculture, using new cultivars under stress of low level of waters and brackish waters and genomes resistant to pests and droughts etc., have to intrigue scientists in our part of the world to find a lasting solution to the challenging problem. Fundamental change in water policies and engaging science to develop a unique water management scheme is imperative. Currently, water policies are divorced from sound science. Demands should be managed by a new culture of efficiency, cutting losses, and protecting water from overuse and pollution. There is no doubt that the Climate change and Water - Energy - Food security Nexus in the Arab Middle East, is becoming more complex due to rapid population growth and growing demands by industrial and agricultural developments. Therefore, science becomes crucial in providing the basis for sound governance and a holistic approach enlightened policy linked to energy and water management for sound food security. The potential of what modern science R&D can do is without limits. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Climate change has wide-ranging effects on the environment and socio-economic and related sectors which includes water resources, agriculture and food security, human health, terrestrial ecosystems, coastal zones and biodiversity. Farmers are under pressure to the changing weather and increasing unpredictable water supply. Because of rainfall deficiencies, artificial application of water has been made through irrigation. Irrigation is a basic determinant of agriculture because its inadequacies are the most powerful constraints on the increase of agricultural production. Irrigation networks are permanent and temporary conduits that supply water to agricultural areas from an irrigation source. Detection of irrigation networks using LiDAR DTM, and flood susceptible assessment of irrigation networks could give baseline information on the development and management of sustainable agriculture. Map Gully Depth (MGD) in Whitebox GAT was used to generate the potential irrigation networks. The extracted MGD was overlaid in ArcGIS as guide in the digitization of potential irrigation networks. A flood hazard map was also used to identify the flood susceptible irrigation networks in the study area. The study was assessed through field validation of points which were generated using random sampling method. Results of the study showed that most of the detected irrigation networks have low to moderate susceptibility to flooding while the rest have high susceptibility to flooding which is due to shifting weather. These irrigation networks may cause flood when it overflows that could also bring huge damage to rice and other agricultural areas. © 2017 SPIE.

AB  - Contemporary societies are facing a broad range of challenges, from pressures on human health and well-being to natural capital depletion, and the security of food, water and energy. These challenges are deeply intertwined with global processes, such as climate change and with local events such as natural disasters. The EU's research & innovation (R&I) policy is now seeking to address these challenges from a new perspective, with Nature-Based Solutions, and turn them into innovation opportunities that optimise the synergies between nature, society and the economy. Nature-Based Solutions can be an opportunity for innovation, and are here promoted by both policymakers and practitioners as a cost-effective way of creating a greener, more sustainable, and more competitive economy. Since 2013, the European Commission has devoted particular attention to Nature-Based Solutions through consultations and dialogues that sought to make the concept of these solutions more concrete and to define the concept's place within the spectrum of ecosystem-based approaches. In 2014, the Commission launched an expert group, which conducted further analysis, and made recommendations to help increase the use of Nature-Based Solutions and bring nature back into cities. In 2015, a survey was conducted on citizens' views and perceptions of 'Nature in Cities' to provide further insight for future work. Based on these elements and on results from running EU projects, the Commission has developed an R&I agenda for Nature-Based Solutions and has published targeted calls for proposals for large-scale demonstration projects in this field in 2016 and 2017. Additional R&I actions at EU level that promote systemic Nature-Based Solutions and their benefits to cities and territories are planned with the aim to improve the implementation capacity and evidence base for deploying Nature-Based Solutions and developing corresponding future markets. They are also expected to foster an interdisciplinary R&I and stakeholder community and the exchange of good practices in this field, as well as help shaping and implementing international R&I agendas on Nature-Based Solutions. © 2017

AB  - Trees are an important and vital part of human survival and an essential part of biodiversity. The forest trees are renewable sources of wood, timber, food, fodder, fuel, and other valuable non-timber products, and due to increase in population and the ardent desire of human being for survival, there has been a constant reduction in forest from the earth’s surface. The current scenario of global climate change threatens to hamper the agro-ecosystems by drastically affecting the key components of environment such as temperature, pattern of rainfall, drought, and water logging. These changes not only affect productivity but are also responsible for decline in the quality of fruits, and litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is one of them. Several conventional approaches have been exploited in the past for the promulgation and improvement of litchi. However, such efforts are confronted with several natural drawbacks and need extensive research to solve the challenges. The application of biotechnological tools for in vitro regeneration, micropropagation, and genetic engineering in litchi species has been applied with success, especially in the last decade, and by the help of genetic engineering technology, it has become possible to introduce desired genes in a much simpler way in litchi. This chapter reviews some of the basic aspects and advancement made in litchi propagation and genetic transformation techniques for further improvement. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

AB  - Access to adequate food and nutrition is a fundamental human right. However, a significant population worldwide presently suffers from malnutrition and inadequate access to food. To meet the goal of zero hunger and malnutrition, agricultural production must maintain pace with increasing food demand. This goal is being challenged by rapidly changing socio-economic and environmental issues. Climate change, depleting soil and water resources, air, water and soil pollution are not only reducing productivity, but also pose a threat to food safety and nutrition. This book analyzes linkages between agriculture and environmental changes, major challenges and potential solutions to secure future food security. It covers, in detail, the impacts of major environmental changes including climate change and air pollution on crops and agricultural production. The potential solutions to address these challenges are also discussed. This book provides the reader with a broad view of interactions between agriculture and the environment, where agriculture is not only vulnerable but also acts as a contributor and offers mitigation options for some of the challenges in sustaining future food security. Agricultural sustainability in near and long-term future will depend on adapting crops and crop management practices based on emerging scientific knowledge of plant physiology and resource efficient technologies combined with focused socio-economic reforms to conserve food diversity and traditional practices. With the help of specific case studies, this book also highlights the significance of reforming small scale farming practices. Overall, this book provides the core idea of sustainable agriculture and food production in current and future scenarios, and is recommended for anyone interested in this topic. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The environmental engineering discipline has focused much of its historical efforts in developing regions of the world on advancing environmental sustainability through improving provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services. However, the skills and expertise that reside within the discipline of environmental engineering are fundamental to achieve a much broader range of sustainable development goals, including those related to health, climate, water, energy, and food security; economic development; and reduction of social inequalities. Accordingly, this article critically reviews several focus areas where environmental engineering should assume a more active presence in the global community that seeks to achieve sustainability in developing regions of the world. The 10 environmental engineering Grand Challenges for the developing world covered are: (1) understand the historical perspective of the discipline's connection with public health as the field transitions forward; (2) integrate the differences encountered when operating over rural to urban locations; (3) address emissions of greenhouse gases and other important carbon-containing pollutants; (4) understand the link between development and health to better connect health outcomes and reduction in risk with ecosystem management and other development interventions; (5) address the complex interactions of water energy systems; (6) integrate the synergy inherent in development/sustainability goals of WASH, food security, and resource recovery; (7) transition to a green economy; (8) advance monitoring, evaluation, and assessment activities that include life cycle assessment, (9) integrate culture, perception, and behavior with advances in science and technology, and (10) educate globally competent engineers. Our hope is that this discussion leads to a better world through monumental improvements in the environment and human well-being and drives new innovations and opportunities in research, education, practice, and service. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.

AB  - Despite progress with the food-associated health agenda in the public health and clinical domains, much remains to be done in Indonesia. There are reasons to be optimistic which include economic development, increasing literacy, progress towards universal health coverage and community organizational arrangements across the archipelago which focus on health through some 10,000 puskesmas. These community health centres are variably staffed with voluntary cadres from the community, bidans (nurses) and general medical practitioners. For more effective prevention and management of nutritionally-related health problems, innovative community and clinical nutrition research and expertise is required. With rapid urbanisation, the growth of the digital economy, increasing socio-economic inequity and climate change, there are imperatives for ecologically sustainable, nonemployment dependent livelihoods which provide energy, food, water, education and health care security. A relevant health care workforce will include those who research and practice clinical nutrition. Here we gather together an account of an extensive body of published and emerging literature which makes a case collectively for a more ecological approach to nutrition and health and how it might revitalise the Indonesian and other health care systems.

AB  - The water, food, energy nexus has prompted sustainability concerns as interactions between these interdependent human needs are degrading natural resources required for a secure future world. Discussions about the future needs for food, water, and energy to support the increasing world population have ignored our soil resource that is the cornerstone or our capacity to produce food, capture water, and generate energy from biological systems. Soil scientists often recognize soils as a critical component of food, energy, or water security; however, the translation of that awareness into action strategies to either enhance public recognition of soil resource importance or improve soil management is lacking. Food, water, and energy security represents the current and future challenge of sustaining humankind while protecting the environment. These interactions are recognized by scientists, but the linkage to policy decisions or implementation of strategies to create positive outcomes for food, energy, or water enhancement is lacking. If we consider that soil is responsible for 99% of the world's food production, then the importance of soil in the food, energy, water nexus becomes apparent. If we further consider that soil erosion is the major factor, affecting soil degradation and declines in productivity are directly related to degradation of the soil resource, then the implications of soil in the context of increasing food, energy, and water security becomes more evident. However, if the attitude is one that technology will provide answers to these problems, then the soil degradation rate will continue to increase and we will reach a tipping point in which technological advances will not be able to overcome the impacts of a reduced topsoil depth coupled with a more variable climate. Soil is the forgotten piece of the food, energy, water nexus; however, the oversight extends beyond this nexus to include many of the ecological services required by humankind. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Since the mid-19th century, human activities have increased greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the Earth's atmosphere that resulted in increased average temperature. The effects of rising temperature include soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land, desertification, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, reduced fresh-water resources, acidification of the oceans, and the disruption and depletion of stratospheric ozone. All these have an impact on human health, causing non-communicable diseases such as injuries during natural disasters, malnutrition during famine, and increased mortality during heat waves due to complications in chronically ill patients. Direct exposure to natural disasters has also an impact on mental health and, although too complex to be quantified, a link has even been established between climate and civil violence. Over time, climate change can reduce agricultural resources through reduced availability of water, alterations and shrinking arable land, increased pollution, accumulation of toxic substances in the food chain, and creation of habitats suitable to the transmission of human and animal pathogens. People living in low-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Climate change scenarios include a change in distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with weather extreme events. After floods, increased cases of leptospirosis, campylobacter infections and cryptosporidiosis are reported. Global warming affects water heating, rising the transmission of water-borne pathogens. Pathogens transmitted by vectors are particularly sensitive to climate change because they spend a good part of their life cycle in a cold-blooded host invertebrate whose temperature is similar to the environment. A warmer climate presents more favorable conditions for the survival and the completion of the life cycle of the vector, going as far as to speed it up as in the case of mosquitoes. Diseases transmitted by mosquitoes include some of the most widespread worldwide illnesses such as malaria and viral diseases. Tick-borne diseases have increased in the past years in cold regions, because rising temperatures accelerate the cycle of development, the production of eggs, and the density and distribution of the tick population. The areas of presence of ticks and diseases that they can transmit have increased, both in terms of geographical extension than in altitude. In the next years the engagement of the health sector would be working to develop prevention and adaptation programs in order to reduce the costs and burden of climate change. © 2017, NIOC Health Organization.

AB  - Maintaining the long-term sustainability of human and natural systems across agricultural landscapes requires an integrated, systematic monitoring system that can track crop productivity and the impacts of agricultural intensification on natural resources. This study presents the design and practical implementation of a monitoring framework that combines satellite observations with ground-based biophysical measurements and household surveys to provide metrics on ecosystem services and agricultural production at multiple spatial scales, reaching from individual households and plots owned by smallholder farmers to 100-km2 landscapes. We developed a set of protocols for monitoring and analyzing ecological and agricultural household parameters within two 10 × 10-km landscapes in Rwanda, including soil fertility, crop yield, water availability, and fuelwood sustainability. Initial results suggest providing households that rely on rainfall for crop irrigation with timely climate information and improved technical inputs pre-harvest could help increase crop productivity in the short term. The value of the monitoring system is discussed as an effective tool for establishing a baseline of ecosystem services and agriculture before further change in land use and climate, identifying limitations in crop production and soil fertility, and evaluating food security, economic development, and environmental sustainability goals set forth by the Rwandan government. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - In the conclusion to this volume, we try to characterize the worldview that has emerged from this work, and distill its unifying messages. We argue that the Anthropocene may be conceived as an age of generalized upheaval. Human behavior has affected the planet's climate system, altered biogeochemical processes, reduced biodiversity, modified global hydrology, and changed land cover at an unprecedented pace. Closely linked to this is the rapid loss of social stability and clarity of purpose that characterized much of the 20th century. Prominent elements of contemporary social upheaval include rapid urbanization, the unprecedented volume of sudden human displacements, disruptions to public health caused by factors such as the migration of tropical disease, the deepening of inequality around the world, high speed technology innovation and diffusion, the rapid erosion of the built environment, political gridlock, and new threats at every level of security - human, national and existential. Generalized turbulence suggests the need for a new approach to governance, one that focuses on reconciling systems rather than mainly measuring and reporting simple metrics, such as crime and literacy rates. © 2017 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - The Loess Plateau (LP) is one of the most fragile eco-regions in China, and is characterized by severe soil erosion and water shortage. The fragile environment poses a threat to ecological safety and sustainable development on the LP and neighboring areas. The ecosystem on the LP has undergone great changes in recent decades owing to dramatic climate change, ecological rehabilitation, and tremendous human pressure. This study was focused on quantifying and assessing the multiple ecosystem services from 2000 to 2012, based on actual observation records and widely used biophysical models. These included Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWSQ), Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA), and rainfall storage method. Furthermore, in this study, the roles of climate variability and an ecological restoration program on vegetation activity and ecosystem services were investigated, as well as the synergies between multiple ecosystem services. The slight increase in both precipitation and temperature during 2000–2012, in conjunction with ecological rehabilitation, induced a trend of increasing in vegetation cover and productivity. During 2000–2012, the overall soil retention function was slightly enhanced while the amount of hydrological regulation decreased. The biomass production (vegetation carbon sequestration) and food production increased sharply. The increasing precipitation intensified water erosion by enhancing rainfall erosivity, whereas the reduction in wind speed lessened wind erosion and thereby reduced the frequency and duration of sandstorm events. Vegetation restoration supported by climate variability and resulting from ecological projects also played positive roles in soil retention enhancement. The spatial correlation analyses indicated synergies between multiple regulating ecosystem services. There was also a synergy between food production and carbon sequestration in vegetation. The performance of ecological rehabilitation and changes in ecosystem services on the LP exemplified the need for ecological conservation to take climate variability into account, and to facilitate synergies involving multiple ecosystem services, to maximize human well-being and preserve natural ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fisheries are an essential ecosystem service, but catches from freshwaters are often overlooked. Hundreds of millions of people around the world benefit from low-cost protein, recreation, and commerce provided by freshwater fisheries, particularly in regions where alternative sources of nutrition and employment are scarce. Here, we derive a gridded global map of riverine fisheries and assess its implications for biodiversity conservation, fishery sustainability, and food security. Catches increase with river discharge and human population density, and 90% of global catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. Fish richness and catches are positively but not causally correlated, revealing that fishing pressure is most intense in rivers where potential impacts on biodiversity are highest. Merging our catch analysis with nutritional and socioeconomic data, we find that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people. Poor and undernourished populations are particularly reliant on inland fisheries compared with marine or aquaculture sources. The spatial coincidence of productive freshwater fisheries and low food security highlights the critical role of rivers and lakes in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. At the same time, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our enhanced spatial data on estimated catches can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity.

AB  - Soil, a natural four-dimensional body at the atmosphere-lithosphere interface, is organic-carbon-mediated realm in which solid, liquid, and gaseous phases interact at a range of scales and generate numerous ecosystem goods and services. Soil organic carbon (SOC) strongly impacts soil quality, functionality and health. Terms soil quality and soil health should not be used interchangeable. Soil quality is related to what it does (functions), whereas soil health treats soil as a living biological entity that affects plant health. Through plant growth, soil health is also connected with the health of animals, humans, and ecosystems within its domain. Through supply of macro- and micronutrients, soil health, mediated by SOC dynamics is a strong determinant of global food and nutritional security. Soil C pool consists of two related but distinct components: SOC and soil inorganic C (SIC). The SIC pool comprises of primary and secondary carbonates, and the latter consists of calcitic (no net sequestration of atmospheric CO2) and silicatic (net sequestration). While SOC is highly dynamic, its mean residence time depends on the degree of protection (physical, chemical, biological, and ecological) within the soil matrix. Formation of stable microaggregates and of organo-mineral complexes can protect SOC against microbial processes for millennia. In addition to formation of silicatic type of secondary carbonates, leaching of bicarbonates into the subsoil or shallow water table is also an important mechanism of sequestration of CO2 as SIC. Numerous soil functions and ecosystem services depend on SOC and its dynamics. Improvements in soil health, along with increase in availability of water and nutrients, increases soil's resilience against extreme climate events (e.g., drought, heat wave) and imparts disease-suppressive attributes. Enhancing and sustaining soil health is also pertinent to advancing Sustainable Development Goals of the U.N. such as alleviating poverty, reducing hunger, improving health, and promoting economic development.

AB  - Large-scale and long-term restoration efforts are urgently needed to reverse historical global trends of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics. Restoration of forests within landscapes offers multiple social, economic, and environmental benefits that enhance lives of local people, mitigate effects of climate change, increase food security, and safeguard soil and water resources. Despite rapidly growing knowledge regarding the extent and feasibility of natural regeneration and the environmental and economic benefits of naturally regenerating forests in the tropics, tree planting remains the major focus of restoration programs. Natural regeneration is often ignored as a viable land-use option. Here, we assemble a set of 16 original papers that provide an overview of the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of forest and landscape restoration (FLR), a relatively new approach to forest restoration that aims to regain ecological integrity and enhance human well-being in deforested or degraded forest landscapes. The papers describe how spontaneous (passive) and assisted natural regeneration can contribute to achieving multiple social and ecological benefits. Forest and landscape restoration is centered on the people who live and work in the landscape and whose livelihoods will benefit and diversify through restoration activities inside and outside of farms. Given the scale of degraded forestland and the need to mitigate climate change and meet human development needs in the tropics, harnessing the potential of natural regeneration will play an essential role in achieving the ambitious goals that motivate global restoration initiatives. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - Western North America is a region defined by extreme gradients in geomorphology and climate, which support a diverse array of ecological communities and natural resources. The region also has extreme gradients in mercury (Hg) contamination due to a broad distribution of inorganic Hg sources. These diverse Hg sources and a varied landscape create a unique and complex mosaic of ecological risk from Hg impairment associated with differential methylmercury (MeHg) production and bioaccumulation. Understanding the landscape-scale variation in the magnitude and relative importance of processes associated with Hg transport, methylation, and MeHg bioaccumulation requires a multidisciplinary synthesis that transcends small-scale variability. The Western North America Mercury Synthesis compiled, analyzed, and interpreted spatial and temporal patterns and drivers of Hg and MeHg in air, soil, vegetation, sediments, fish, and wildlife across western North America. This collaboration evaluated the potential risk from Hg to fish, and wildlife health, human exposure, and examined resource management activities that influenced the risk of Hg contamination. This paper integrates the key information presented across the individual papers that comprise the synthesis. The compiled information indicates that Hg contamination is widespread, but heterogeneous, across western North America. The storage and transport of inorganic Hg across landscape gradients are largely regulated by climate and land-cover factors such as plant productivity and precipitation. Importantly, there was a striking lack of concordance between pools and sources of inorganic Hg, and MeHg in aquatic food webs. Additionally, water management had a widespread influence on MeHg bioaccumulation in aquatic ecosystems, whereas mining impacts where relatively localized. These results highlight the decoupling of inorganic Hg sources with MeHg production and bioaccumulation. Together the findings indicate that developing efforts to control MeHg production in the West may be particularly beneficial for reducing food web exposure instead of efforts to simply control inorganic Hg sources. © 2016

AB  - Environmental engineers have played a critical role in improving human and ecosystem health over the past several decades. These contributions have focused on providing clean water and air as well as managing waste streams and remediating polluted sites. As environmental problems have become more global in scale and more deeply entrenched in sociotechnical systems, the discipline of environmental engineering must grow to be ready to respond to the challenges of the coming decades. Here we make the case that environmental engineers should play a leadership role in the development of climate change mitigation technologies at the carbon-water nexus (CWN). Climate change, driven largely by unfettered emissions of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, is a far-reaching and enormously complex environmental risk with the potential to negatively affect food security, human health, infrastructure, and other systems. Solving this problem will require a massive mobilization of existing and innovative new technology. The environmental engineering community is uniquely positioned to do pioneering work at the CWN using a skillset that has been honed, solving related problems. The focus of this special issue, on "The science and innovation of emerging subsurface energy technologies," provides one example domain within which environmental engineers and related disciplines are beginning to make important contributions at the CWN. In this article, we define the CWN and describe how environmental engineers can bring their considerable expertise to bear in this area. Then we review some of the topics that appear in this special issue, for example, mitigating the impacts of hydraulic fracturing and geologic carbon storage, and we provide perspective on emergent research directions, for example, enhanced geothermal energy, energy storage in sedimentary formations, and others. © Copyright Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.

AB  - The experiment was undertaken in three water stress environments to assess the inherent diversity of the primary gene pool of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) following morphophysiological criteria and thereafter validation of these genotypes in the current trend of climate change. Plot achene yield was maximum in control and ranged from 10.3g to 54.7g in W1, 7.2 to 52.2 in W2, 9.7 to 49.8 in W3 and 10.0 to 51.8 in W4. The genotypes P-94-R, P-115-R and P-119-R were found to be severely affected by the treatments, however, 95-C-1-R and P-87-R resisted to water stress and showed minimum reduction in seed yield. D2 statistics grouped the test genotypes into 6 clusters. Cluster I comprised of maximum number of genotypes (27 genotypes), followed by cluster II (5 genotypes), cluster III and V (3 genotypes in each), cluster IV (2 genotypes), and cluster VI (1 genotypes). Among the traits evaluated, leaf area index contributed the maximum (18.54%) towards the observed diversity, followed by early vigour (18.35%), oil content (12.35%), 100 seed weight (10.59), photosynthetic capacity (9.58%), and plant height (9.29%), and leaf water potential (6.16%), achene yield per plant (4.50%), head diameter (4.19%) and canopy temperature (3.16%). Genotypes P69R, P87R, P93R, P115R, NDLR2 (Cluster I), P107RP1 (Cluster II), P121R (Cluster III), P111R (Cluster IV), 40B and 50B (Cluster V) and 7-1B (Cluster VI) identified as stress tolerant genotypes. The study concludes cytoplasmic restorer lines P111R, P112R and P110R and maintainer lines 71B, 40B and 50B as putative genetic material to comply threatening climatic phenomenon.

AB  - Fresh produce has been a growing cause of food borne outbreaks world-wide prompting the need for safer production practices. Yet fresh produce agrifood systems are diverse and under constraints for more sustainability. We analyze how measures taken to guarantee safety interact with other objectives for sustainability, in light of the diversity of fresh produce agrifood systems. The review is based on the publications at the interface between fresh produce safety and sustainability, with sustainability defined by low environmental impacts, food and nutrition security and healthy life. The paths for more sustainable fresh produce are diverse. They include an increased use of ecosystem services to e.g. favor predators of pests, or to reduce impact of floods, to reduce soil erosion, or to purify run-off waters. In contrast, they also include production systems isolated from the environment. From a socio-economical view, sustainability may imply maintaining small tenures with a higher risk of pathogen contamination. We analyzed the consequences for produce safety by focusing on risks of contamination by water, soil, environment and live stocks. Climate change may increase the constraints and recent knowledge on interactions between produce and human pathogens may bring new solutions. Existing technologies may suffice to resolve some conflicts between ensuring safety of fresh produce and moving towards more sustainability. However, socio-economic constraints of some agri-food systems may prevent their implementation. In addition, current strategies to preserve produce safety are not adapted to systems relying on ecological principles and knowledge is lacking to develop the new risk management approaches that would be needed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Mixed agroforestry systems offer opportunities to simultaneously meet the water, food, energy and income needs of densely populated rural and peri-urban areas in Indonesia. Water flows out of upland areas provide multiple ecosystem services to downstream areas that can be part of performance-based rewards, payments or co-investment in environmental stewardship. Metrics for measuring performance and negotiating accountability need to cover river (blue), soil + vegetation (green), recycled (gray) and atmospheric (rainbow) water in relation to specific stages in the water cycle and associated services. A typology of services and prototype payment mechanisms were derived from action research in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia by the Rewarding Upland Poor for Environmental Services (RUPES) project. The ecological metrics of landscape performance can be combined with measures of human capacity to assess and support the resilience of social-ecological systems under climate change. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Globally, the area of sugarcane is rising rapidly in response to growing demands for bioethanol and increased sugar demand for human consumption. Despite considerable diversity in production systems and contexts, sugarcane is a particularly "high impact" crop with significant positive and negative environmental and socio-economic impacts. Our analysis is focused on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which is a critical region for continued expansion, due to its high production potential, low cost of production and proximity, and access, to European markets. Drawing on a systematic review of scientific evidence, combined with information from key informants, stakeholders and a research-industry workshop, we critically assess the impacts of sugarcane development on water, soil and air quality, employment, food security and human health. Our analysis shows that sugarcane production is, in general, neither explicitly good nor bad, sustainable nor unsustainable. The impacts of expansion of sugarcane production on the environment and society depend on the global political economy of sugar, local context, quality of scheme, nature of the production system and farm management. Despite threats from climate change and forthcoming changes in the trade relationship with the European Union, agricultural development policies are driving national and international interest and investment in sugarcane in SSA, with expansion likely to play an important role in sustainable development in the region. Our findings will help guide researchers and policy makers with new insights in understanding the situated environmental and social impacts associated with alternative sugar economy models, production technologies and qualities of management. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Rapid and periodic assessment of the impact of land cover change and climate variability on ecosystem services at regional levels is essential to understanding services and sustainability of ecosystems. This study focused on quantifying and assessing the changes in multiple ecosystem services in the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR), China in 2000-2012. Based on the widely used biophysical models including Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-Offs (InVEST), Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWSQ), and Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) models, this study assessed the historical flow of regulating services, including soil conservation, water yield, and carbon sequestration, and provisioning service food provision. The soil conservation function of ecosystem was slightly enhanced as a whole, and water yield increased sharply, with both the soil conservation and water yield showing an increasing spatial homogenization. The net primary productivity (NPP) and food production increased substantially from 2000 to 2012. Ecosystem services are closely and complexly interlinked. The correlation analyses indicated a trade-off between the water yield and carbon sequestration, however, a synergy between soil conservation and carbon sequestration. Congruence between the three different ecosystem provisioning services, including pasture, meat, and grain, was found. There was also a synergy between food production and ecosystem carbon sequestration in the TRHR. Climatic variability and vegetation restoration are important for the ecosystem services flow. Correlation analyses showed that the increase in precipitation significantly enhanced the water yield (P < 0.01) and soil erosion (P < 0.01), while the temperature increase influenced positively the NPP (P < 0.1). The experience of ecological rehabilitation and the change in key ecosystem services in the TRHR exemplified the positive effects of environmental policies and the necessity of adopting an adaptive management approach. Thus the ecological construction and policy making should take climate variability into account, and facilitate synergies on multiple ecosystem services in order to maximize human well-being and preserve its natural ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Africa shares the lowest portion of greenhouse gases emission in the world both in total and per capita, yet she suffers mostly from climate change. Climate change affects Africa’s water resources, agriculture, biodiversity, human health, and national security. Food and water security are the two major challenges facing Africa whilst have been deteriorated by climate change. This study reviews the new findings of climate change impacts on water system and agriculture in Africa and their limitations, with the attempt to facilitate and promote enhanced researches related to climate change impact and vulnerability. Observation shows that climate change has led to rapid melting of glaciers, reduced rainfall and increased variability. Hydrological simulation demonstrates that further climate change would decrease precipitation and runoff in some areas, worsening current fragile water supply in most of Africa. Africa’s agriculture faces unprecedented challenges under climate change. Both observation and simulation indicate climate change posed negative effects on Africa’s agriculture. Increased risks of drought, changed growth season and decreased crop yield, would likely threat food security in Africa. Uncertainties in these studies mainly come from climate scenarios, methods, quality and quantity of data. Compared to other regions, Africa is short of comprehensive and in-depth researches related to climate change impact and vulnerability, therefore expects substantial investment on such activities to devise effective strategies in mitigating the negative effects of climate change on water resources and agriculture. © 2016 Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology.

AB  - The impact of globalisation and industrialisation has been a subject for research around the globe due to the huge paradigm shift caused by them. Such phenomena are also a cause of concern as cities consume close to three-quarters of the world’s natural resources and generate three-quarters of its pollution and waste. There is a need for the cities to get smarter through the application of innovative solutions to address large-scale urbanisation challenges and find new ways for creating liveable, competitive and self-reliant cities. In this direction, the advent of smart cities could be a much larger wave of transformation which is about to splash the entire world. The precise content, feature and nature of smart cities vary from country to country, depending upon geographical condition, ecosystems, resource availabilities and major challenges being faced. Pilot projects have been taken up in almost all parts of the world to emulate such cities. Many countries have rolled out grand plans for the development of both greenfield and brownfield smart cities. There have been several agitations against such extensive infiltration of information technologies in societies due to the fear of cyberattacks, privacy threats, etc. However, societies have decided to go ahead because of the greater advantages as well as necessity of smarter systems for ensuring a quality life for citizens. The revolution of upcoming smart cities would thus be one of the most holistic movements, which would require extensive participation from almost all fronts of the society, thus resulting in a truly substantive development. Due to enhanced dependency on data sensors, automation technologies, information and communication technologies, software analytical applications, etc., any disruption/disaster may disintegrate the whole string of services and jeopardise the smart city ecosystem. Further, high concentration of population and economic activities make smart cities vulnerable to severe damage in terms of human lives as well as financial breakdown. Therefore, resilient measures for various natural and man-made disasters need to be taken care of. Major portions of all urban areas on earth are coastal/riverside, exposing them to sea/river-level rise and storm surges. Climate impacts such as cyclones, floods and droughts have financial impacts, with major disruption to business operations and city finances. This necessitates that at the onset of the development of smart city, concomitant actions are needed to make them resilient to disaster as well. This article introduces the concept of smart city and discusses its various attributes. Technology span required for smart city development has been analysed and presented. Some of the global initiatives have been discussed, along with the Government of India’s ambitious programme of establishing 100 smart cities on a fast track. The planning and prioritisation strategies necessary for the success and sustainability of such a programme are discussed. To be really intelligent, cities must also consider the impacts of climate change. Therefore, disaster risk reduction is one of the key aspects in smart city development. Accordingly, vulnerabilities associated with smart cities have been listed with a holistic and far-sighted approach. These help in identification of mechanisms, policies and practices to be taken up by all the stakeholders to ensure that the smart cities serve their purpose of socio-economic development and citizen-centric governance, instead of procedural governance, without posing a threat to security, stability and integrity of the individuals and the society as a whole. The article also highlights the need for establishing a central command control centre and the shift in administrative procedures as well as emergency governance structures to accommodate the modern needs of involving citizens extensively in building these cities, not only literally but also figuratively. © 2016 Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA) SAGE Publications.

AB  - Production of economically competitive and environmentally sustainable algal biofuel faces technical challenges that are subject to high uncertainties. Here we identify target values for algal productivity and financing conditions required to achieve a biocrude selling price of $5 per gallon and beneficial environmental impacts. A modeling framework-combining process design, techno-economic analysis, life cycle assessment, and uncertainty analysis-was applied to two conversion pathways: (1) "fuel only (HTL)", using hydrothermal liquefaction to produce biocrude, heat and power, and (2) "fuel and feed", using wet extraction to produce biocrude and lipid-extracted algae, which can substitute components of animal and aqua feeds. Our results suggest that with supporting policy incentives, the "fuel and feed" scenario will likely achieve a biocrude selling price of less than $5 per gallon at a productivity of 39 g/m2/day, versus 47 g/m2/day for the "fuel only (HTL)" scenario. Furthermore, if lipid-extracted algae are used to substitute fishmeal, the process has a 50% probability of reaching $5 per gallon with a base case productivity of 23 g/m2/day. Scenarios with improved economics were associated with beneficial environmental impacts for climate change, ecosystem quality, and resource depletion, but not for human health.

AB  - Soil health, along with water supply, is the most valuable resource for humans, as human life depends on the soil's generosity. Soil degradation, therefore, poses a threat to food security, as it reduces yield, forces farmers to use more inputs, and may eventually lead to soil abandonment. Unfortunately, the importance of preserving soil health appears to be overlooked by policy makers. In this paper, I first briefly introduce the present situation concerning agricultural production, natural resources, soil degradation, land use and the challenge ahead, to show how these issues are strictly interwoven. Then, I define soil degradation and present a review of its typologies and estimates at a global level. I discuss the importance of preserving soil capital, and its relationship to human civilization and food security. Trends concerning the availability of arable agricultural land, different scenarios, and their limitations, are analyzed and discussed. The possible relation between an increase in a country's GNP, population and future availability of arable land is also analyzed, using the World Bank's database. I argue that because of the many sources of uncertainty in the data, and the high risks at stake, a precautionary approach should be adopted when drawing scenarios. The paper ends with a discussion on the key role of preserving soil organic matter, and the need to adopt more sustainable agricultural practices. I also argue that both our relation with nature and natural resources and our lifestyle need to be reconsidered. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - The impacts of recent natural disasters highlight the hidden vulnerabilities in society’s food, energy, and water systems and the potential for climate change to amplify these social liabilities. Some have pointed to technological solutions to reduce vulnerabilities and to build resiliency into food, energy, and water systems (FEWS). While technological advances to upgrade human systems, e.g., in agriculture, urban planning, pollution abatement, and green energy development, are critical, these technical advances are insufficient on their own. Effective FEWS management depends on understanding human decision-making, including adaptations to new environmental, social, or economic changes and the responses of individuals and communities to new technologies intended to improve FEWS resilience and sustainability. This paper draws on multiple social science perspectives, including decision science, economics, and sociology, to consider the fundamental role that human behavior and adaptations play in FEWS. We discuss the importance of accounting for human behavior within a coupled human-natural systems framework in which a range of human adaptations and feedbacks are considered, including how humans might respond directly to press-pulse dynamics and indirectly through their adoption of new technology. Following a brief summary of key concepts of decision-making theory at individual and community scales, we then focus on migration and land use changes, the two types of human adaptations that are particularly important for FEWS modeling and management. The paper concludes with a discussion of key knowledge gaps and research needs in the social sciences related to human adaptations in the context of FEWS. © 2016, AESS.

AB  - Efforts to promote appreciation for the multifaceted contributions of forests are particularly timely because of the many threats currently faced by forests. These threats include the world’s growing population, which is projected to top 9.1 billion by 2050; global climate change; land degradation; land scarcity; and deforestation. Already, human activities have destroyed 50 % of the forests that once existed under modern climatic conditions. The US Forest Service’s research and management activities are promoting the health, productivity, and resilience of forests and grasslands by, for example, advancing agroforestry, producing and applying science and technology that integrates energy production into sustainable forest and grassland management practices, and protecting water supplies by increasing the quality of aquatic habitats, reducing erosion, and decreasing peak flows. The US Forest Service must increase public understanding and support for such efforts to restore and create healthy landscapes that will supply vital resources to future generations. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - The concept of tracing the ecologically-based life cycle impacts of agricultural and food industries (AFIs) has become a topic of interest worldwide due to their critical association with the climate change, water and land footprint, and food security. In this study, an in-depth analysis of ecological resource consumption, atmospheric emissions, land and water footprints of 54 agricultural and food industries in the U.S. were examined extensively. Initially, the supply-chain linked ecological life cycle assessment was performed with Ecologically-based Life Cycle Assessment (Eco-LCA) tool. Then, the results of life cycle inventory were used to assess the mid and end-point impacts by using the ReCiPe approach. Thirdly, ecological performance assessment was performed using well-known metrics, including loading and renewability ratios and eco-efficiency analysis. As a novel comprehensive approach, the integrated framework that consists of the Eco-LCA, ReCiPe and linear programming-based ecological performance assessment is of importance to have an overall understanding about the extent of impacts related to agricultural and food production activities across the U.S. Results indicated that grain farming, dairy food, and animal production-related sectors were found to have the greatest shares in both environmental and ecological impact categories as well as endpoint impacts on human health, ecosystem and resources. In terms of climate change, animal (except poultry) slaughtering, rendering, and processing (ASRP), cattle ranching and farming (CRF), fertilizer manufacturing (FM), grain farming (GF), fluid milk and butter manufacturing (FMBM) were found to be the top five dominant industries in climate change impacts accounting for about 60% share of the total impact. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sustainability considerations have been absent from most food security assessments conducted to date, despite the tremendous economic, environmental, and social implications of meeting accelerating food demand in the face of water shortages and climate change. In addition, previous food security work has generally focused only on achieving adequate calories, rather than addressing dietary diversity and micronutrient adequacy, both of which are critical to maintaining a healthy overall nutritional status. In response to the limitations of previous assessments, a new methodology is proposed here based on the concept of "sustainable nutrition security" (SNS). This novel assessment methodology is intended to remedy both kinds of deficiencies in the previous work by defining seven metrics, each based on a combination of multiple indicators, for use in characterizing sustainable nutrition outcomes of food systems: (1) food nutrient adequacy; (2) ecosystem stability; (3) food affordability and availability; (4) sociocultural wellbeing; (5) food safety; (6) resilience; and (7) waste and loss reduction. Each of the metrics comprises multiple indicators that are combined to derive an overall score (0-100). A novel SNS assessment methodology based on these metrics can be deployed by decision-makers and investors to set meaningful goals, track progress, and evaluate the potential impact of food system interventions intended to improve sustainability and human nutrition outcomes. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - Groundwater is important for energy and food security, human health and ecosystems. The time since groundwater was recharged-or groundwater age-can be important for diverse geologic processes, such as chemical weathering, ocean eutrophication and climate change. However, measured groundwater ages range from months to millions of years. The global volume and distribution of groundwater less than 50 years old-modern groundwater that is the most recently recharged and also the most vulnerable to global change-are unknown. Here we combine geochemical, geologic, hydrologic and geospatial data sets with numerical simulations of groundwater and analyse tritium ages to show that less than 6% of the groundwater in the uppermost portion of Earth's landmass is modern. We find that the total groundwater volume in the upper 2 km of continental crust is approximately 22.6 million km3, of which 0.1-5.0 million km3 is less than 50 years old. Although modern groundwater represents a small percentage of the total groundwater on Earth, the volume of modern groundwater is equivalent to a body of water with a depth of about 3m spread over the continents. This water resource dwarfs all other components of the active hydrologic cycle. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Siberia is the backbone of the economy of modern Russia due to huge reserves of gas, oil, land and water. Not only resource extracting and processing industries, but also forestry and agriculture capitalize these resources with implications for local and global processes of nature and society. We analysed the state of land and water resources with regard to the impacts of human activity and climate change. The environmental status of forests, agricultural lands and inland water bodies was evaluated based on our own research and the recent literature. The focus was on agro-ecosystems. Our synthetic review revealed that peatlands and Tundra ecosystems are endangered by resource-extracting industries and industrial air pollution. Mining and industrial activity damage soil and vegetation and accelerate thermokarst processes. Forest ecosystems suffer increasingly from fires, insect outbreaks and improper management. Past and recent mining and industrial activity has polluted soils and water seriously in many regions. Permafrost melting could expose cases of old and inherited pollution. The impact of agriculture on water quality is still low but will increase. Agriculture is in a recession and operates inefficiently, destroying the soil. There is largely a lack of any agri-environmental monitoring in many regions. The rural infrastructure is on the verge of collapse, in the High North and the Far East in particular. State natural reserves (zapovedniks) are endangered by illegal activities and lack integration into scientific monitoring. Overall, monitoring programmes on the status of land and water resources lack consistency and modern technology. Climate change will put a great deal of additional pressure on Siberian landscapes, but hard data are required, and monitoring systems need to be modernized. Siberian landscapes have great potential for the mitigation of climate change through carbon sequestration and for improving people’s livelihoods. Environmentally friendly business activities such as organic food production, environmental tourism and recreational fishing are still underdeveloped. We conclude that the status of food production and the disintegration of rural areas are risks for Russian food security and national security. Modern technologies for monitoring and research ecosystems are needed to generate sustainable developments in managing the land and water resources of Siberia. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The current global fisheries production is ~160 million tonnes. The quantum is gradually rising as a result of increases in aquaculture production. A number of climate-related threats to capture both the fisheries and aquaculture are identified, but we have high uncertainty in predictions of the future fisheries production because of uncertainty over the future global aquatic net primary production and the transfer of this production through the food chain to human consumption. Recent changes in the distribution and productivity of a number of fish species can be ascribed with high confidence to regional climate variability, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. The future production may increase in some high-latitude regions because of warming and decreased ice cover, but the dynamics in low-latitude regions are governed by different processes, and production may decline as a result of reduced vertical mixing of the water column and, hence, reduced recycling of nutrients. There are strong interactions between the effects of fishing and the effects of climate because fishing reduces the age, size and geographic diversity of populations and the biodiversity of marine ecosystems, making both more sensitive to additional stresses such as climate change-induced salinity oscillation. The estuaries in the lower Gangetic delta at the apex of Bay of Bengal are noted for contrasting spatial variation of salinity. The Hooghly estuary in the western sector is relatively low saline compared to the Matla estuary in the central sector on account of receiving the fresh water discharge from the Farakka barrage. The central sector is hyper saline due to siltation of the Bidyadhari River since the late fifteenth century. The present study evaluates the condition factor of fourteen commercially important fin fish species (that constitute ~75 % of the fishes in the catch basket) collected from the Hooghly and Matla estuaries in the western and central sectors of the lower Gangetic delta, respectively. Relatively higher values of condition factor of all the species collected from the Hooghly estuary (compared to those collected from the Matla estuary) confirm the adverse effect of hyper salinity on the growth and condition factor of the species. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Inhabitants of the high-mountain Andes have already begun to experience changes in the timing, severity, and patterning of annual weather cycles. These changes have important implications for agriculture, for human health, and for the conservation of biodiversity in the region. This paper examines the implications of climate-driven changes for native and traditional crops in the municipality of Colomi, Cochabamba, Bolivia. Data were collected between 2012 and 2014 via mixed methods, qualitative fieldwork, including participatory workshops with female farmers and food preparers, semi-structured interviews with local agronomists, and participant observation. Drawing from this data, the paper describes (a) the observed impacts of changing weather patterns on agricultural production in the municipality of Colomi, Bolivia and (b) the role of local environmental resources and conditions, including clean running water, temperature, and humidity, in the household processing techniques used to conserve and sometimes detoxify native crop and animal species, including potato (Solanum sp.), oca (Oxalis tuberosa), tarwi (Lupinus mutabilis), papalisa (Ullucus tuberosus), and charke (llama or sheep jerky). Analysis suggests that the effects of climatic changes on agriculture go beyond reductions in yield, also influencing how farmers make choices about the timing of planting, soil management, and the use and spatial distribution of particular crop varieties. Furthermore, household processing techniques to preserve and detoxify native foods rely on key environmental and climatic resources, which may be vulnerable to climatic shifts. Although these findings are drawn from a single case study, we suggest that Colomi agriculture characterizes larger patterns in what might be termed, "indigenous food systems." Such systems are underrepresented in aggregate models of the impacts of climate change on world agriculture and may be under different, more direct, and more immediate threat from climate change. As such, the health of the food production and processing environments in such systems merits immediate attention in research and practice. © 2016 Keleman Saxena, Cadima Fuentes, Gonzales Herbas and Humphries.

AB  - Introduction The origin of mainstream Western agriculture lies in the ‘fertile crescent’ of the Middle East and, in this cradle of arable farming, dryland plants were domesticated that currently constitute some of our major cereal, legume and fibre crops. This ‘semi-desert’ agriculture installed the idea that productive land must be dry, a paradigm that ever since has been applied also to wet, organic soils. We deeply drain peatland to grow arid maize Zea mays in Germany, strongly water-demanding sugar cane Saccharum spp. in Florida and the desert species Aloe vera in Indonesia. Practices like this have made agriculture the main driver of global peatland loss (Joosten and Clarke 2002, Chapter 2) and drained peatlands are thus primarily found in regions that are climatically favourable for agriculture, i.e. in the temperate zone and the (sub)tropics (Chapter 2). Peatland drainage causes inherent peatland degradation, a substantial financial and environmental burden and eventually the loss of the productive value of the peat soil (Joosten, Tapio-Biström and Tol 2012). These problems are increasingly being recognised: worldwide several thousands of square kilometres of drained agricultural peatlands have been rewetted in recent years for climate change mitigation, for biodiversity, or simply because maintaining drainage infrastructure had become too expensive. Rewetting has indeed re-established major regulating and cultural services of wet peatlands, including carbon storage, flood control, water purification, archive function and biodiversity (Theuerkauf et al. 2006; Limpens et al. 2008; Trepel 2010; Tanneberger and Wichtmann 2011; Joosten et al. 2015a; Chapter 6). The provisioning services of these formerly productive lands, however, were mostly lost as the rewetted areas were generally earmarked for nature conservation with the condition that they would no longer be used agriculturally. On the other hand, the quest for productive land is rapidly growing worldwide. This demand will continue to increase, because of the inevitable growth of human population and the justified demands for food security and more welfare. The demand will also grow, because biomass from cultivated land will increasingly have to replace the resources that until now were obtained from the wilderness (wood, non-timber forest products, bushmeat) and the bedrock (coal, oil, gas, minerals). Both the persistent use of drained peatlands for agriculture and the conversion of agriculturally used peatlands to unused wetlands imply that we are losing productive land at a time when we need it most. © British Ecological Society 2016.

AB  - Characterized by fragile geo-ecology, marginality, inaccessibility, and subsistence livelihoods, the land resources in the Middle Mountain region of Nepal are intensively cultivated beyond their carrying capacity. Lack of off-farm employment opportunities combined with limited productive lands has forced the mountain communities to eke out their living through intensive cultivation of crops to fragile mountain slopes. Cropping systems vary considerably with land types, elevation, slope, aspect, seasonal water availability, soil types, and their fertility. Multiple cropping, in combination with several crop rotations are predominant to safeguard food supply and meet dietary requirements of households. Land management practices such as terracing, traditional agro-forestry practices and intercropping are some of the best examples that have been developed by the farmers by their ingenuity to cope with the harsh and fragile mountain ecosystems. The mountain cropping systems have to face numerous natural and human-induced challenges, including land degradation and loss of agro-biodiversity, leading to food insecurity and unsustainable livelihoods. This region is highly vulnerable to environmental degradation and climate change is seen as a risk multiplier. Meeting the ever-growing food demands while sustaining land productivity and maintaining resiliency at the farm level is the major challenge faced by the mountain farmers. This chapter outlines the typical characteristics of the mountain cropping systems and discusses how they are coping with the ongoing natural and socio-economic dynamics. The vulnerability of the fragile mountain agro-ecosystems to climate change and its impacts on land use and cropping systems are discussed. The mountains agriculture seems to be highly vulnerable to climate change effects particularly erratic rainfall events and droughts, and land degradation due to soil erosion, landslides, flash floods, and siltation leading to loss of productive lands, crops failure and food insecurity. Effective measures to cope with such impacts in the mountain agro-ecosystem are suggested. Increased public awareness about the climate change effects, building adaptive capacity to cope with such effects, sustainable soil and water conservation practices, and resilient cropping practices (drought tolerant crop/varieties, change in crop rotations, and water use efficiency) seem to be the key strategies to be adopted to cope with the climate change effects in the fragile mountain agro-ecosystems. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The Man Who Thought He Owned Water is author Tershia d’Elgin’s fresh take on the gravest challenge of our time-how to support urbanization without killing ourselves in the process. The gritty story of her family’s experience with water rights on its Colorado farm provides essential background about American farms, food, and water administration in the West in the context of growing cities and climate change. Enchanting and informative, The Man Who Thought He Owned Water is an appeal for urban-rural cooperation over water and resiliency. When her father bought his farm-Big Bend Station-he also bought the ample water rights associated with the land and the South Platte River, confident that he had secured the necessary resources for a successful endeavor. Yet water immediately proved fickle, hard to defend, and sometimes dangerous. Eventually those rights were curtailed without compensation. Through her family’s story, d’Elgin dramatically frames the personal-scale implications of water competition, revealing how water deals, infrastructure, transport, and management create economic growth but also sever human connections to Earth’s most vital resource. She shows how water flows to cities at the expense of American-grown food, as rural land turns to desert, wildlife starves, the environment degrades, and climate change intensifies. Depicting deep love, obsession, and breathtaking landscape, The Man Who Thought He Owned Water is an impassioned call to rebalance our relationship with water. It will be of great interest to anyone seeking to understand the complex forces affecting water resources, food supply, food security, and biodiversity in America. © 2016 by Tershia D’Elgin.

AB  - Changes in Earth’s climate at the end of the last ice age brought about seasonal conditions that favoured the cultivation of annual plants like wild cereals, helping to launch the agricultural revolution. Earth’s climate is changing again, mainly through the effects of human actions on the biosphere. To feed a projected population of 9.6 billion people by 2050 while reducing agriculture’s carbon, nitrogen, and environmental footprints requires a revolution in food crop productivity and a deeper understanding of the interplay between sustainable food production and natural ecosystems. These goals cannot be achieved without making appropriate use of advanced technologies. Genome-wide association studies, marker-assisted selection, and genomic selection of orphan crops in developing countries can help enhance yields, nutrition, disease resistance, and crop resilience in the face of climate change. With major cereal crop yields stagnating or in decline, successful C4 photosynthesis engineering of rice and wheat and nitrogen fixation engineering of rice, wheat, and maize would have enormous consequences for crop productivity, environmental remediation, and land, soil, and water conservation. Next-generation DNA sequencing, genome editing, synthetic biology, and molecular modeling provide the tools needed for these ambitious efforts to succeed. Innovative food crop bioscience and healthy ecosystems constitute a symbiosis for the Anthropocene. © 2016, RIS.

AB  - In recent decades, global climate change has continued to cause devastating impacts to various places on Earth. Geographic and socioeconomic characteristics in East Africa (EA) and South America (SA) make the regions among the most vulnerable to the current temperature variations attracting several studies with wider implications. Presently, in these two regions, remarkable evidence of climate change includes repeated droughts and increase in drylands affecting water and food availability for humans, livestock, and wildlife (EA); intensification of climate-sensitive diseases; sea level rise; fast retreat of glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Kenya in Kenya, and Andean Mountains of South America; change in the rainfall patterns in the Amazon forests and in the whole of EA; and increasing of the frequency and intensity of the El Niño and La Niña phenomenon in the South Pacific that affect both EA and SA, among others. Although these two regions are not major contributors of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the poor conservation of strategic ecosystems through deforestation of the Amazon forests in SA and various forests in EA coupled with intensification of agriculture, land degradation, rapid rates of urbanization, and industrialization all driven by rapid population increase are putting a strain on valuable natural resources whose conservation would be critical in mitigating climate change. Adaptation measures have been constrained by climate change impacts. In both regions, poverty is widespread and climate change impacts have jeopardized most poverty alleviation initiatives including realization of some of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Moreover, both regions have a strong dependency on rain-fed agriculture for economic development with hydroelectricity and biomass as main sources of energy. Consequently, adaptation measures are required for all the sectors but especially in agriculture, health, and energy where the loss of soil productivity, increasing spread of climate-sensitive diseases, and reduction of water and energy source supply are already threatening the social and economic security of both regions. Both regions have a wealth of indigenous knowledge and coping mechanisms of various local communities that should be incorporated into conventional adaptation measures of climate change. This chapter describes the main climate change impacts in EA and SA, vulnerabilities thereon, and adaptation measures that offer an opportunity to the two regions to develop in a sustainable way. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 and Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.

AB  - Agroforestry is widely known to increase resilience and reduce vulnerability of agricultural production systems to climate change effects. Agroforestry may potentially improve livelihood through simultaneous production of food, fodder, timber and firewood as well as mitigation and adaptation to climate change. This chapter critically examines the role of agroforestry in natural resource (soil, water, nutrients, biodiversity) conservation, livelihood security (goods and services to society), providing social and economic well-being to people and carbon sequestration. Moreover, the role of agroforestry is more pronounced and relevant in degraded and fragile agroecosystems, such as the Himalayas. Agroforestry in the Himalayas contributes significantly to ecological, social and economic functions and serves as complementary to natural forests. Therefore, a winning strategy for natural resource conservation and human welfare in the fragile Himalayas can be achieved by promoting scientific agroforestry practices to reconcile food production with conservation in climate change scenario. Agroforestry needs to be strengthened by developing appropriate innovative technologies, community participation, domestication, strong policy support and establishing strong market linkages. Similarly, efforts are needed to promote science-based decision-making, and future thrust is required to remove the remaining uncertainties and to also carefully test the agroforestry practices against other land uses in Himalayan ecosystems in order to know their suitability and to what extent agroforestry can serve mankind and ecosystems. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.

AB  - The 'surplus' of oceanic water generated by climate change offers an unprecedented opportunity to tackle a number of global issues through a very pragmatic process: shifting the excess water from the oceans onto the land. Here we propose that sea-level rise could be mitigated through the desalination of very large amounts of seawater in massive desalination plants. To efficiently mitigate sea-level rise, desalinized water could be stored on land in the form of crop, wetlands or new forests. Based on a US$ 500 million price to build an individual mega desalination plant with current technology, the cost of controlling current sea-level rise through water desalination approaches US$ 23 trillion. However, the economic, environmental and health benefits would also be immense and could contribute to addressing a number of global issues including sea-level rise, food security, biodiversity loss and climate change. Because these issues are intimately intertwined, responses should aim at addressing them all concurrently and at global scale. © 2016 Boyer S and Lefort MC.

AB  - During the last two decades, the world has recognized that the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases (GHGs), namely, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), have increased markedly as a result of human activities. During pre-industrial era (1750 AD), their concentrations were 280 ppm, 715 ppb and 270 ppb, respectively, and these values have increased to 385 ppm, 1797 ppb and 322 ppb, respectively, in 2008. Increase in atmospheric CO2 promotes growth and productivity of plants with C3 photosynthetic pathway, but the increase in temperature, on the other hand, can reduce crop duration, increase crop respiration rates, affect the survival and distribution of pest populations and may hasten nutrient mineralization in soil, decrease fertilizer use efficiency and increase evapotranspiration and soil salinity. The water resources which are already scarce may come under enhanced stress. In the scenario of sea-level rise due to climate change, the inundated area with sea water will increase influencing the crop production due to higher salinity. Thus, the impact of climate change is likely to have a significant influence on agriculture and eventually on the food security and livelihoods of a large section of the rural population. There are evidences of negative impacts on yield of crops with variable magnitude in diverse ecologies including soil salinity and waterlogging particularly in the developing countries. Adaptation strategies and mitigation through perennial cropping systems such as agroforestry can be the main approach in handling climate change and salinity-related problems. Upscaling of modern technologies such as conservation and smart agriculture, judicious utilization of available water (including poorquality water) for agriculture through micro-irrigation and water-saving technologies, developing multiple stress-tolerant crops through molecular biological tools, restoration of degraded soils and waters, promoting carbon sequestration preferably through efficient agroforestry practices and conservation of biodiversity should be promoted at regional and country level. We need to formulate both short-term and long-term policies for improvement, sustenance and protection of natural resources. There is a need of capacity building and international collaboration in developing database for efficient weather forecasting and handling salinity-related problems and preparing contingency plans for vulnerable areas. The objectives of this paper are to summarize the information available on the mitigation options and adaptation strategies for climate change and rehabilitation of saline and waterlogged habitats to meet the food security especially in India. © Springer India 2016.

AB  - The global issues facing the 21st century (e.g., food security, climate change, biodiversity, water quality, tropical deforestation, and poverty) can be addressed through soil and landscape restoration, which are essential for humans to live in symbiotic harmony with nature. Soil and landscape restoration are essential to strengthening ecosystem functions and services. The basic principles of landscape restoration include controlling soil erosion, reducing losses of water and nutrients, sequestering carbon, strengthening biogeochemical cycles, managing soil pH and salt balance, enhancing biocomplexity, and creating disease-suppressive soil. The technologies for landscape restoration must include implementation of soil restoration at the landscape level, harmonization of ecological effects with current and future population and social changes, and utilization of traditional knowledge. Establishing vegetation cover, managing water judiciously, recycling plant nutrients, and creating balanced plant nutrition are important to landscape restoration. Long-term planning is essential to the sustainable use of finite resources and provisioning of basic ecosystem services. Soil organic carbon concentration and quality are important to landscape restoration and ecosystem functions. Enhancing organic carbon concentration in the soil to above the threshold/critical level of 1.1%-2% in the root zone is needed to improve soil quality. This chapter considers the importance of the soil organic carbon pool to soil quality and outlines principles and strategies of soil and landscape restoration. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A global analysis indicates that more than 2 billion ha of cleared and degraded forest lands-an area twice the size of China-are not in productive agriculture or human habitation. Restoring these lands represents an immense opportunity to improve food security, human livelihoods, water supplies, climate stability, and natural resource management demonstrated through successful examples of restoration in Niger, Nepal, Brazil, India, and Ethiopia. However, challenges remain. It is essential to assess the motivation for restoration, the enabling conditions, and the factors that make implementation possible. Before rushing into restoration decisions, it is important to recognize that returning a landscape to its former ecosystem may not be possible (or even desirable) in some places. In order to create resilient landscapes for the 21st century, we need to simultaneously restore forests and increase the productivity of existing agricultural lands, which support human livelihoods and well-being. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The positive effects of water quality improvement on stream biodiversity in the temperate regions are expected to be at risk with the projected climatic changes. However, the processes and mechanisms behind the predicted threats remain uncertain. From long-term series of benthic invertebrate samples from temperate rivers and streams in France, we analyzed diversity and composition shifts over time in relation to geographic elements and human stressors. Mechanisms for community changes were investigated with a trait-based analysis for the entire dataset and for a selected caddisfly community module. We observed a 42% increase in the taxonomic richness of stream invertebrate communities over the last 25 years. A gradual trend induced by water quality improvement was distinguished from a more abrupt climate change-induced shift in communities around the year 2000. Trophic amplification – the intensification of trophic interactions and pathways through the food web – was identified as the mechanism behind the strong community shift. Four lines of evidence for this trophic amplification are highlighted: (i) higher dissolved oxygen concentrations indicated a shift in primary production, (ii) the trait-based analysis of entire communities showed a bottom-up food web amplification, (iii) the trait-based analysis of the community module evidenced feeding strategy shifts and increased food web interactions, and (iv) the abundance analysis of the community module showed a productivity increase. These results lend credit to persistent investments in water quality for improving stream biodiversity, and contrary to expectation, climate change impacts seem so far to have reinforced these positive effects. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During the past two centuries, the world has witnessed a remarkable increase in the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases (GHGs), namely carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), as a result of human activities after 1750 (preindustrial era). During 1750 the concentrations for these gases were 280 ppm, 715 ppb, and 270 ppb, respectively which increased to 379 ppm, 1774 ppb, and 319 ppb, respectively in 2005. It showed an increase of 0.23, 0.96, and 0.12% annually. The same has further increased to 385 ppm, 1797 ppb, and 322 ppb, respectively in 2008 representing 1.6, 1.2, and 0.9% increase, respectively from 2005 levels at an annual increase of 0.53, 0.43, and 0.31%, annually. Increase in atmospheric CO2 promotes growth and productivity of plants with C3 photosynthetic pathway but the increase in temperature, on the other hand, can reduce crop duration, increase crop respiration rates, affect the survival and distribution of pest populations, and may hasten nutrient mineralization in soils, decrease fertilizer-use efficiency, and increase evapotranspiration. The water resources which are already scarce may come under enhanced stress. Thus, the impact of climate change is likely to have a significant influence on agriculture and eventually on the food security and livelihoods of large sections of the urban and rural populations globally. The developing countries, particularly in South Asia and Latin America, with diverse agroclimatic regions, challenging geographies, growing economies, diverse agricultural production systems, and farm typologies are more vulnerable to the effect of climate change due to heavy dependence on agriculture for livelihood. These regions also are demonstrating poor coping mechanisms to adapt to these challenges, and as a result there is evidence of negative impacts on productivity of wheat, rice, and other crops to varying extent depending on agroecologies. Upscaling of modern technologies such as conservation and climate smart agriculture, judicious utilization of available water for agriculture through microirrigation and water saving technologies, developing multiple stress-tolerant crop cultivars and biotypes through biotechnological tools, restoration of degraded soils and waters, promoting carbon sequestration through alternate production technologies and land use, and conservation of biodiversity must be promoted at regional and country level to ensure durable food and nutritional security. Reliable early warning system of environmental changes, their spatial and temporal magnitude, coupled with policies to support the diffusion of this information, can help interpret these forecasts in terms of their agronomic and economic implications for the benefit of farmers and to provide agriculture-dependent industries and policymakers with more informed options to support farmers. These countries need to formulate both short-term and long-term policies for improvement, sustenance, and protection of natural resources. There is an urgent need for capacity building through international collaboration in order to develop databases and analysis systems for efficient weather forecasting as well as preparing contingency plans for vulnerable areas. The objectives of this paper are to summarize the available information on adaptation strategies and the mitigation options for climate change to meet the food security in South Asia and Latin America. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Warming and drying in the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East (EMME) associated with climate change may have consequences for humans and ecosystems, including agriculture. Agriculture can be directly affected through meteorological conditions that influence crop growth and yield. Here we explored changes in the yield of durum (winter) wheat Triticum tirgidum in the EMME region caused by projected changes in thermal and hydrological conditions, employing the agro-ecological zones (AEZ) methodology. The climate input was obtained from simulations by the PRECIS regional climate model over the EMME domain at 25 km resolution, driven by a range of IPCC emissions scenarios for the 21st century. For the crop yield calculation, we used 2 steps of the biomass calculation from the AEZ methodology by calculating crop yield potentials with regard to temperature, solar radiation and evapotranspiration regimes. Our results showed that for the recent past, the highest wheat yields are found in the Fertile Crescent and the coastal areas of eastern Mediterranean Europe. The former region is projected to be negatively affected by the additional heat due to climate warming, while in the latter region yield gains may be expected. Our implementation of the AEZ methodology can be based on a range of climate data and can be applied to a number of crops, contributing to yield studies relevant for regional assessments of food security. © 2016 Inter-Research.

AB  - Plant landraces represent heterogeneous, local adaptations of domesticated species, and thereby provide genetic resources that meet current and new challenges for farming in stressful environments. These local ecotypes can show variable phenology and low-to-moderate edible yield, but are often highly nutritious. The main contributions of landraces to plant breeding have been traits for more efficient nutrient uptake and utilization, as well as useful genes for adaptation to stressful environments such as water stress, salinity, and high temperatures. We propose that a systematic landrace evaluation may define patterns of diversity, which will facilitate identifying alleles for enhancing yield and abiotic stress adaptation, thus raising the productivity and stability of staple crops in vulnerable environments. Global climate change emphasizes the need to use better-adapted cultivars of the main crops and landraces as potential donors of useful genes. The contribution of modern agriculture to total human-made greenhouse gas emissions is approximately 30%, and a shift to agro-ecological modes of production is increasingly seen as urgent, with landraces playing an important role in breeding programs.During the past few decades interest in landrace conservation has been growing, with much research focusing on the maintenance of on-farm crop genetic diversity.There is increasing consumer concern worldwide about food safety and nutrition. Landraces or old crop cultivars may provide solutions as sources of healthy and nutritious food. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Achieving climate compatible development (CCD) is a necessity in developing countries, but there are few examples of requisite planning processes, or manifestations of CCD. This paper presents a multi-stakeholder, participatory planning process designed to screen and prioritise rural livelihood adaptation strategies against nine CCD criteria. The process also integrated three principles of adaptation pathways: interventions should be (1) 'no regrets' and maintain reversibility to avoid mal-adaptation; (2) address both proximate and underlying systemic drivers of community vulnerability; and (3) linked across spatial scales and jurisdictional levels to promote coordination. Using examples of two rural sub-districts in Indonesia, we demonstrate the process and resulting CCD strategies. Priority strategies varied between the sub-districts but all reflected standard development interventions: water management, intensification or diversification of agriculture and aquaculture, education, health, food security and skills-building for communities. Strategies delivered co-benefits for human development and ecosystem services and hence adaptive capacity, but greenhouse mitigation co-benefits were less significant. Actions to deliver the strategies' objectives were screened for reversibility, and a minority were potentially mal-adaptive (i.e. path dependent, disproportionately burdening the most vulnerable, reducing incentives to adapt, or increasing greenhouse gas emissions) yet highly feasible. These related to infrastructure, which paradoxically is necessary to deliver 'soft' adaptation benefits (i.e. road access to health services). Only a small minority of transformative strategies addressed the systemic (i.e. institutional and political) drivers of vulnerability. Strategies were well-matched by development programs, suggesting that current interventions mirror CCD. However, development programs tackled fewer systemic drivers, were poorly coordinated and had a higher risk of mal-adaptation. We conclude that the approach is effective for screening and prioritising no regrets CCD, but more extensive learning processes are necessary to build decision-makers' capacity to tackle systemic drivers, and to scrutinise potentially mal-adaptive infrastructural investments. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Environmental conditions do not exist in a vacuum. They are influenced by science, politics, history, public policy, culture, economics, public attitudes, and competing priorities, as well as past human decisions. In the case of Central Asia, such Soviet-era decisions include irrigation systems and physical infrastructure that are now crumbling, mine tailings that leach pollutants into soil and groundwater, and abandoned factories that are physically decrepit and contaminated with toxic chemicals. Environmental Crises in Central Asia highlights major environmental challenges confronting the region’s former Soviet republics: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. They include threats to the Caspian and Aral seas, the impact of climate change on glaciers, desertification, deforestation, destruction of habitat and biodiversity, radioactive and hazardous wastes, water quality and supply, energy exploration and development, pesticides and food security, and environmental health. The ramifications of these challenges cross national borders and may affect economic, political, and cultural relationships on a vast geographic scale. At the same time, the region’s five governments have demonstrated little resolve to address these complex challenges. This book is a valuable multi-disciplinary resource for academics, scholars, and policymakers in environmental sciences, geography, political science, natural resources, mass communications, public health, and economics. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Eric Freedman and Mark Neuzil.

AB  - The rapid development of coastal economy in Hebei Province caused rapid transition of coastal land use structure, which has threatened land ecological security. Therefore, calculating ecosystem service value of land use and exploring ecological security baseline can provide the basis for regional ecological protection and rehabilitation. Taking Huanghua, a city in the southeast of Hebei Province, as an example, this study explored the joint point, joint path and joint method between ecological security and food security, and then calculated the ecological security baseline of Huanghua City based on the ecosystem service value and the food safety standard. The results showed that ecosystem service value of per unit area from maximum to minimum were in this order: wetland, water, garden, cultivated land, meadow, other land, salt pans, saline and alkaline land, constructive land. The order of contribution rates of each ecological function value from high to low was nutrient recycling, water conservation, entertainment and culture, material production, biodiversity maintenance, gas regulation, climate regulation and environmental purification. The security baseline of grain production was 0.21 kg·-2, the security baseline of grain output value was 0.41 yuan·m-2, the baseline of ecosystem service value was 21.58 yuan·m-2, and the total of ecosystem service value in the research area was 4.244 billion yuan. In 2081 the ecological security will reach the bottom line and the ecological system, in which human is the subject, will be on the verge of collapse. According to the ecological security status, Huanghua can be divided into 4 zones, i.e., ecological core protection zone, ecological buffer zone, ecological restoration zone and human activity core zone. © 2016, Science Press.

AB  - The reuse of treated wastewater could be a promising measure to attenuate the water scarcity burden. In agriculture, irrigation with wastewater may contribute to improve production yields, reduce the ecological footprint and promote socioeconomic benefits. However, it cannot be considered exempt of adverse consequences in environmental and human health. Apart from the introduction of some biological and chemical hazardous agents, the disturbance of the indigenous soil microbial communities and, thus, of vital soil functions impacting soil fertility may occur. The consequences of these disturbances are still poorly understood. This chapter summarises the physicochemical and microbiological alterations in soil resultant from irrigation with treated wastewater that are described in scientific literature. These alterations, which involve a high complexity of variables (soil, wastewater, climate, vegetal cover), may have impacts on soil quality and productivity. In addition, possible health risks may arise, in particular through the direct or indirect contamination of the food chain with micropollutants, pathogens or antibiotic resistance determinants. The current state of the art suggests that irrigation with treated wastewater may have a multitude of long-term implications on soil productivity and public health. Although further research is needed, it seems evident that the analysis of risks associated with irrigation with treated wastewater must take into account not only the quality of water, but other aspects as diverse as soil microbiota, soil type or the cultivated plant species. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The consumption of animal-sourced food products by humans is one of the most powerful negative forces affecting the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems and biological diversity. Livestock production is the single largest driver of habitat loss, and both livestock and feedstock production are increasing in developing tropical countries where the majority of biological diversity resides. Bushmeat consumption in Africa and southeastern Asia, as well as the high growth-rate of per capita livestock consumption in China are of special concern. The projected land base required by 2050 to support livestock production in several megadiverse countries exceeds 30-50% of their current agricultural areas. Livestock production is also a leading cause of climate change, soil loss, water and nutrient pollution, and decreases of apex predators and wild herbivores, compounding pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity. It is possible to greatly reduce the impacts of animal product consumption by humans on natural ecosystems and biodiversity while meeting nutritional needs of people, including the projected 2-3 billion people to be added to human population. We suggest that impacts can be remediated through several solutions: (1) reducing demand for animal-based food products and increasing proportions of plant-based foods in diets, the latter ideally to a global average of 90% of food consumed; (2) replacing ecologically-inefficient ruminants (e.g. cattle, goats, sheep) and bushmeat with monogastrics (e.g. poultry, pigs), integrated aquaculture, and other more-efficient protein sources; and (3) reintegrating livestock production away from single-product, intensive, fossil-fuel based systems into diverse, coupled systems designed more closely around the structure and functions of ecosystems that conserve energy and nutrients. Such efforts would also impart positive impacts on human health through reduction of diseases of nutritional extravagance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Earth's natural systems represent a growing threat to human health. And yet, global health has mainly improved as these changes have gathered pace. What is the explanation? As a Commission, we are deeply concerned that the explanation is straightforward and sobering: we have been mortgaging the health of future generations to realise economic and development gains in the present. By unsustainably exploiting nature's resources, human civilisation has fl ourished but now risks substantial health eff ects from the degradation of nature's life support systems in the future. Health eff ects from changes to the environment including climatic change, ocean acidifi cation, land degradation, water scarcity, overexploitation of fi sheries, and biodiversity loss pose serious challenges to the global health gains of the past several decades and are likely to become increasingly dominant during the second half of this century and beyond. These striking trends are driven by highly inequitable, ineffi cient, and unsustainable patterns of resource consumption and technological development, together with population growth. We identify three categories of challenges that have to be addressed to maintain and enhance human health in the face of increasingly harmful environmental trends. Firstly, conceptual and empathy failures (imagination challenges), such as an over-reliance on gross domestic product as a measure of human progress, the failure to account for future health and environmental harms over present day gains, and the disproportionate eff ect of those harms on the poor and those in developing nations. Secondly, knowledge failures (research and information challenges), such as failure to address social and environmental drivers of ill health, a historical scarcity of transdisciplinary research and funding, together with an unwillingness or inability to deal with uncertainty within decision making frameworks. Thirdly, implementation failures (governance challenges), such as how governments and institutions delay recognition and responses to threats, especially when faced with uncertainties, pooled common resources, and time lags between action and eff ect. Although better evidence is needed to underpin appropriate policies than is available at present, this should not be used as an excuse for inaction. Substantial potential exists to link action to reduce environmental damage with improved health outcomes for nations at all levels of economic development. This Commission identifi es opportunities for action by six key constituencies: health professionals, research funders and the academic community, the UN and Bretton Woods bodies, governments, investors and corporate reporting bodies, and civil society organisations. Depreciation of natural capital and nature's subsidy should be accounted for so that economy and nature are not falsely separated. Policies should balance social progress, environmental sustainability, and the economy. To support a world population of 9-10 billion people or more, resilient food and agricultural systems are needed to address both undernutrition and overnutrition, reduce waste, diversify diets, and minimise environmental damage. Meeting the need for modern family planning can improve health in the short termeg, from reduced maternal mortality and reduced pressures on the environment and on infrastructure. Planetary health off ers an unprecedented opportunity for advocacy of global and national reforms of taxes and subsidies for many sectors of the economy, including energy, agriculture, water, fi sheries, and health. Regional trade treaties should act to further incorporate the protection of health in the near and long term. Several essential steps need to be taken to transform the economy to support planetary health. These steps include a reduction of waste through the creation of products that are more durable and require less energy and materials to manufacture than those often produced at present; the incentivisation of recycling, reuse, and repair; and the substitution of hazardous materials with safer alternatives. Despite present limitations, the Sustainable Development Goals provide a great opportunity to integrate health and sustainability through the judicious selection of relevant indicators relevant to human wellbeing, the enabling infrastructure for development, and the supporting natural systems, together with the need for strong governance. The landscape, ecosystems, and the biodiversity they contain can be managed to protect natural systems, and indirectly, reduce human disease risk. Intact and restored ecosystems can contribute to resilience (see panel 1 for glossary of terms used in this report), for example, through improved coastal protection (eg, through wave attenuation) and the ability of fl oodplains and greening of river catchments to protect from river fl ooding events by diverting and holding excess water. The growth in urban populations emphasises the importance of policies to improve health and the urban environment, such as through reduced air pollution, increased physical activity, provision of green space, and urban planning to prevent sprawl and decrease the magnitude of urban heat islands. Transdisciplinary research activities and capacity need substantial and urgent expansion. Present research limitations should not delay action. In situations where technology and knowledge can deliver win-win solutions and co-benefi ts, rapid scale-up can be achieved if researchers move ahead and assess the implementation of potential solutions. Recent scientifi c investments towards understanding non-linear state shifts in ecosystems are very important, but in the absence of improved understanding and predictability of such changes, eff orts to improve resilience for human health and adaptation strategies remain a priority. The creation of integrated surveillance systems that collect rigorous health, socioeconomic, and environmental data for defi ned populations over long time periods can provide early detection of emerging disease outbreaks or changes in nutrition and non-communicable disease burden. The improvement of risk communication to policy makers and the public and the support of policy makers to make evidence-informed decisions can be helped by an increased capacity to do systematic reviews and the provision of rigorous policy briefs. Health professionals have an essential role in the achievement of planetary health: working across sectors to integrate policies that advance health and environmental sustainability, tackling health inequities, reducing the environmental impacts of health systems, and increasing the resilience of health systems and populations to environmental change. Humanity can be stewarded successfully through the 21st century by addressing the unacceptable inequities in health and wealth within the environmental limits of the Earth, but this will require the generation of new knowledge, implementation of wise policies, decisive action, and inspirational leadership.

AB  - Beef makes a substantial contribution to food security, providing protein, energy and also essential micro-nutrients to human populations. Rumination allows cattle - and other ruminant species - to digest fibrous feeds that cannot be directly consumed by humans and thus to make a net positive contribution to food balances. This contribution is of particular importance in marginal areas, where agro-ecological conditions and weak infrastructures do not offer much alternative. It is also valuable where cattle convert crop residues and by-products into edible products and where they contribute to soil fertility through their impact on nutrients and organic matter cycles. At the same time, environmental sustainability issues are acute. They chiefly relate to the low efficiency of beef cattle in converting natural resources into edible products. Water use, land use, biomass appropriation and greenhouse gas emissions are for example typically higher per unit of edible product in beef systems than in any other livestock systems, even when corrected for nutritional quality. This particularly causes environmental pressure when production systems are specialized towards the delivery of edible products, in large volumes.The paper discusses environmental challenges at global level, recognizing the large diversity of systems. Beef production is faced with a range of additional sustainability challenges, such as changing consumer perceptions, resilience to climate change, animal health and inequities in access to land and water resources. Entry-points for environmental sustainability improvement are discussed within this broader development context. © 2015.

AB  - Although agricultural ecosystems can provide humans with a wide set of benefits agricultural production system management is mainly driven by food production. As a consequence, a need to ensure food security globally has been accompanied by a significant decline in the state of ecosystems. In order to reduce negative trade-offs and identify potential synergies it is necessary to improve our understanding of the relationships between various ecosystem services (ES) as well as the impacts of farm management on ES provision. We present a spatially explicit application that captures and quantifies ES trade-offs in the crop systems of Llanada Alavesa in the Basque Country. Our analysis presents a quantitative assessment of selected ES including crop yield, water supply and quality, climate regulation and air quality. The study is conducted using semantic meta-modeling, a technique that enables flexible integration of models to overcome the service-by-service modeling approach applied traditionally in ES assessment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sustainable development integrates economic development, social development, and environmental protection, with three overarching objectives and essential requirements: (1) poverty reduction, (2) changing unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, and (3) protecting and managing the natural resource base of economic and social development. Integrated water resources management (IWRM) is capable of promoting all three objectives by providing stakeholders with a framework for integrating and coordinating the various aspects of water management in a sustainable and holistic manner. This chapter relates the concept of IWRM to development in the context of the international community's sustainable development paradigm. Though there would seem to be a universal acceptance of the cross-cutting importance of water in development, relative marginalization of water at different levels has taken place because of competing interests. In the ongoing Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), there is only one target dealing specifically with water (drinking water and sanitation) within one of the eight goals (goal 7-ensure environmental sustainability). There is now a call from the water community for the adoption of a dedicated and comprehensive sustainable development goal onwater in the post-MDG follow-up. Some current topics that need to be encompassed by IWRM are succinctly addressed with reference to the recent international developments, including water security, human rights to water, gender equity, implications of climate change, governance, and the water-energy nexus.The ability of making operational the nexus of water with energy, food, health, and ecosystems by thinking "out of the water box" has become critically important. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA) 2015.

AB  - Rising food and nutritional insecurity threatens the livelihoods of millions of poor people, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Vegetable and legume production and consumption are a potent mechanism for small-scale, disadvantaged farmers to obtain the required nutrients in their diets and to generate much-needed income through trade. Vegetables and legumes are key sources of nutrients and health-promoting phytochemicals, providing higher micronutrient contents and a wider spectrum of essential compounds to meet nutritional and health needs than other food sources. Diversifying diets with vegetables and legumes is a cheaper, surer, and more sustainable way to supply a range of nutrients to the body and combat malnutrition and associated health problems than other approaches that target only a single or a few nutritional factors. Furthermore, vegetables and legumes often accompany staple crops in meals, and most staple crops are less palatable without vegetable or legume accompaniments. As a growing world population demands more and higher quality foods, and as environmental problems such as soil degradation, water scarcity, biodiversity loss, and climate change become more acute, the need for innovative vegetable and legume research solutions to improve food and nutritional security cannot be overemphasized. © 2015 Policy Studies Organization.

AB  - The strong soil–peace link is governed by the need for finite, but essential, resources intricately connected with ecosystem services and functions. Access to adequate and nutritious food is essential to human wellbeing, peace and tranquillity. The relation between soil/environmental scarcity and conflict is complex, and security can only be universal, rather than local or regional, in the present era of globalization. Civil strife and conflict can be caused by both resource paucity and rapacity. Anthropogenic perturbations leading to soil degradation, climate volatility and growing human demands (e.g., food, energy, water, minerals) derived from soil are potential flash points triggering violence at local, regional and global scales. Among different types of drought, pedological and agronomic droughts are triggered by soil degradation, decline in available water capacity of the root zone and changes in the hydrological cycle. Several regions with unstable governments are prone to water scarcity and conflicts. Soil affects world peace through its impact on the quest for victuals, which enhances the relevance of the “Peak Soil” concept. Economic development and environmental enhancement must go hand in hand, and the highest priority must be given to development of the ecosphere. Depicting soil as a work of art for portraying cultural, aesthetical and ecological values can increase public awareness. A Greener Revolution can be ushered in through judicious soil and environmental governance. Maintaining peace and harmony necessitates that soil resources are used, improved, restored and never taken for granted. © 2015 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.

AB  - Soil security can only be achieved when the global soil resource is maintained and improved, requiring a reversal of current degradation processes. This demands a major effort by soil scientists in at least four directions by: (i) demonstrating the importance of soils in inter- and transdisciplinary programs focusing on food, water, climate, biodiversity and energy problems, which are environmental issues that are widely acknowledged to be important; (ii) focusing research on the seven soil functions to demonstrate the importance of soil for widely recognized Ecosystem Services (ES) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG); (iii) reframing reporting of soil studies by not only including technical data but embedding this in human-interest storylines, building on the deep emotional links between soil and man, and (iv) educating and involving knowledge brokers that can link science with societal partners not only during a given project but also in the preparatory and implementation phase. Scientists can only effectively participate in Communities of Practice when they have first properly organized their own affairs in Communities of Scientific Practice. Two case studies illustrated the proposed procedures, combining results of state-of-the-art quantitative models with a description of aspirations, concerns and frustrations of the various stakeholders involved, including farmers, regulators, citizens and entrepreneurs. The connectivity dimension of soil security was quite important here. Soil scientists would be well advised to return to their roots when field work was effectively coupled with laboratory studies. Basic research is and will remain crucial for the profession but should be better linked with tacit knowledge in an effective knowledge chain, working in both directions. Overall, reframing of the soil message is not only needed but also very well possible, requiring out-of-the-box thinking. © 2015 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.

AB  - The freshwater environment is facing unprecedented global pressures. Unsustainable use of surface and groundwater is ubiquitous. Gross pollution is seen in developing economies, nutrient pollution is a global threat to aquatic ecosystems, and flood damage is increasing. Droughts have severe local consequences, but effects on food can be global. These current pressures are set in the context of rapid environmental change and socio-economic development, population growth, and weak and fragmented governance. We ask what should be the role of the water science community in addressing water security challenges. Deeper understanding of aquatic and terrestrial environments and their interactions with the climate system is needed, along with trans-disciplinary analysis of vulnerabilities to environmental and societal change. The human dimension must be fully integrated into water science research and viewed as an endogenous component of water system dynamics. Land and water management are inextricably linked, and thus more cross-sector coordination of research and policy is imperative. To solve real-world problems, the products of science must emerge from an iterative, collaborative, two-way exchange with management and policy communities. Science must produce knowledge that is deemed to be credible, legitimate, and salient by relevant stakeholders, and the social process of linking science to policy is thus vital to efforts to solve water problems. The paper shows how a large-scale catchment-based observatory can be used to practice trans-disciplinary science integration and address the Anthropocene's water problems. © 2015.

AB  - Water security and emergent environmental risks are among the most significant societal concerns. They are highly interlinked to other global risks such as those related to climate, human health, food, human migration, biodiversity loss, urban sustainability, etc. Emergent risks result from the confluence of unanticipated interactions from evolving interdependencies between complex systems, such as those embedded in the water cycle. They are associated with the novelty of dynamical possibilities that have significant potential consequences to human and ecological systems, and not with probabilities based on historical precedence. To ensure water security we need to be able to anticipate the likelihood of risk possibilities as they present the prospect of the most impact through cascade of vulnerabilities. They arise due to a confluence of nonstationary drivers that include growing population, climate change, demographic shifts, urban growth, and economic expansion, among others, which create novel interdependencies leading to a potential of cascading network effects. Hydrocomplexity aims to address water security and emergent risks through the development of science, methods, and practices with the potential to foster a "Blue Revolution" akin to the Green revolution for food security. It blends both hard infrastructure based solution with soft knowledge driven solutions to increase the range of planning and design, management, mitigation and adaptation strategies. It provides a conceptual and synthetic framework to enable us to integrate discovery science and engineering, observational and information science, computational and communication systems, and social and institutional approaches to address consequential water and environmental challenges. © 2015.

AB  - Phytoplankton species are the primary producers in lakes and play important roles in food-web structures. Any shift in their diversity and productivity has an impact on other aquatic life forms. We use a range of environmental variables to explore the possible drivers influencing phytoplankton composition over the last 14,500 years in a temperate lake Lielais Svētiņu, eastern Latvia. Using pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, temperature reconstructions and lithological information as proxies of environmental factors, we statistically test their associations with the fossil phytoplankton community composition. Our results reveal that during the Late Glacial, the climate warming, the decrease in landscape openness, and increase in organic matter were significant environmental variables affecting dynamics of phytoplankton communities, especially in the prevalence of Botryococcus, Tetraedron, Scenedesmus and Pediastrum. According to the Redundancy Analysis and Generalized Least Squares models, Pediastrum, Scenedesmus and Tetraedron were positively associated with waterlogging tolerance that indicates moist soils in surroundings of the lake, during the Early Holocene. The 8.2 ka cold event with a 2–3 °C cooling led to a strong environmental disturbance for nearly 700 years, indicated by an increased chlorophyta accumulation rates and a decrease in the organic matter. Our results indicate that Coelastrumreticulatum and C. polychordum are characteristic for the 8.2 ka cold event. Positive association between cyanobacteria and mean air summer temperature suggests that a warming favoured cyanobacteria over other phytoplankton taxa between 8000 and 4000 cal yr BP. High nutrient loads and water turbidity were more important for the dynamics of cyanobacteria from 4000 to 2000 cal yr BP. Human-driven trophic level change was recorded in the last 2000 years by abundances of fungi Sporormiella and Sordaria, and by the peaks of Gloeotrichia pisum, C. reticulatum and C. polychordum indicating eutrophication. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Although yield and total biomass produced by annual legumes remain major objectives for breeders, other issues such as environment-friendly, resource use efficiency including symbiotic performance, resilient production in the context of climate change, adaptation to sustainable cropping systems (reducing leaching, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide residues), adaptation to diverse uses (seeds for feed, food, non-food, forage or green manure) and finally new ecological services such as pollinator protection, imply the need for definition of new ideotypes and development of innovative genotypes to enhance their commercialization. Taken as a whole, this means more complex and integrated objectives for breeders. Several illustrations will be given of breeding such complex traits for different annual legume species. Genetic diversity for root development and for the ability to establish efficient symbioses with rhizobia and mycorrhiza can contribute to better resource management (N, P, water). Shoot architectures and phenologies can contribute to yield and biotic constraint protection (parasitic weeds, diseases or insects) reducing pesticide use. Variable maturity periods and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses are key features for the introduction of annual legumes to low input cropping systems and for enlarging cultivated area. Adaptation to intercropping requires adapted genotypes. Improved health and nutritional value for humans are key objectives for developing new markets. Modifying product composition often requires the development of specific cultivars and sometimes the need to break negative genetic correlations with yield. A holistic approach in legume breeding is important for defining objectives with farmers, processors and consumers. The cultivar structures are likely to be more complex, combining genotypes, plant species and associated symbionts. New tools to build and evaluate them are important if legumes are to deliver their exciting potential in terms of agricultural productivity and sustainability as well as for feed and food. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Soils of agroecosystems of India are degraded, depleted and severely devoid of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool which is often &lt;1 g kg-1 or barely 10 to 15 Mg C ha-1 to 40 cm depth. Thus, crop yields are low, water and air resources are polluted, and the overall environment is degraded. Indeed, environmental sustainability in India remains a major issue to be addressed. Concentration of SOC is a strong determinant of soil quality. Furthermore, quality of soil also impacts those of plants and animals, and thus, health of human population. Restoration of SOC pool to above the threshold level of 10 to 15 g kg-1 in the root zone is essential to advancing food and nutritional security, achieving climate change adaptation and mitigation, improving water quality and renewability, increasing biodiversity, and alleviating poverty by increasing productivity. Among causes of the severe depletion of SOC pool are extractive farming practices of residue removal, indiscriminate plowing, excessive irrigation by flooding, none or unbalanced application of fertilizers, and use of dung as a household fuel rather than manure. Uncontrolled grazing and shifting cultivation also contribute to soil degradation. The extent and severity of degradation are exacerbated by accelerated erosion by water and wind, salinization, acidification, elemental imbalance, and anerobiosis. Thus, soil degradation trends must be reversed by improving SOC concentration through creation of a positive soil/ecosystem C budget. Among best management practices (BMPs) are afforestation and reforestation of hill slopes and agriculturally marginal lands. Establishment of plantations and agroforestry systems is another option. Some BMPs for cropland, essential to improving SOC pool and advancing food security, are conservation agriculture, integrated nutrient management, and crop diversification especially of the rice-wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains. Policy interventions are needed to promote the adoption of BMPs through payments for ecosystems services. Improved governance and strong political will power are essential to revolutionizing the stagnating Indian agriculture. © 2018, IndianJournals.com. All rights reserved.

AB  - World food production is expected to be doubled by 2050. India and China, the most densely populated countries of the world will require to maintain atleast 4–5% annual growth rate in agriculture to keep pace with the growing population and to sustain world food security. For example, India supports about 17% of human and 11% of livestock population of the world just on 2.8% land and 4.2% of water resources. As per recent estimates, India will need to produce about 281 mt food grains, 53.7 mt oilseeds, 22 mt pulses, 127 mt vegetables and 86 mt fruits by 2020–21. The country will have to produce more quality food with diminishing natural resource base and changing climate. The issues of current concern to national food, nutritional and environmental security include: diversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural use, decreasing land holding size, declining profit margin in agriculture, depletion of ground water, deteriorating soil health and biodiversity, increased frequency of climate related risks such as cyclones/tsunami, drought and floods, cold and heat waves etc; contamination of soil and water with heavy metals like arsenic, selenium and fluoride and their cycling in plant-animal-human-atmosphere chain. Ever increasing concentration of green house gases in the atmosphere resulting in global warming is likely to have serious repercussions for human beings, animals, plants, microbes and environment. As per National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), 40% farmers want to quit agriculture and the young generation is no more interested in farming profession. Major shift in terms of diversification of agriculture into crops, commodities, enterprises, cropping/farming systems is called upon to revert the process of degradation of natural resources, rejuvenations of waste lands and also to make agriculture a profitable business. © 2015, Indian Society of Agronomy.

AB  - Semi-arid areas are found in a large number of countries and regions of Africa and South and Central Asia. They display high vulnerability to climate change with considerable adaptation needs. In this paper, we review country-level and multi-country projects supported by international agencies. We examine the priorities and goals presented in national adaptation planning documents and in sectorial planning documents. Through this analysis, we seek to compare adaptation needs with current trends in national, regional and global projects and collaborations. Our results suggest that initiatives supported by international agencies play a considerable role in achieving national adaptation priorities, especially in areas such as agriculture and water management. However, compared with specific adaptation options such as drought-resistant species and irrigation (which tend to be the scope of the projects), the analyzed documents tend to see challenges in agriculture more in the contexts of food security, livestock and rural development. They emphasize the strong connection between rural livelihoods and sustainable land and ecosystem management. Priorities listed in the national documents but not captured in current initiatives include human health, pastoralism, security and migration. Our results also show high levels of mainstreaming adaptation into sectorial planning documents, especially those on poverty reduction; however, compared with the focus on the project level, they here emphasize adaptations focused on institutional development and governance. Finally, the outcomes indicate that global, regional and national initiatives are distributed unequally and that countries in Central and West Africa and Central Asia currently exhibit low participation, especially in national projects. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Abstract The importance of animal production in the overall context of human activity is undisputed and influences food supply, job security, income producing, as well as landscape and local ecosystems conservation. This relevance enhances the charges by society as the environmental impacts of various activities, especially in relation to ruminant production amid the current problems of climate changes. In this context, we analyzed the main environmental impacts of two typical beef cattle production systems from southern Brazil, namely the extensive system (ES) and the improved system (IS), and identified the components that have the greatest environmental impacts using the life cycle assessment method. The basis of the system construction was a cattle herd that originated from 100 weaned heifers, four weaned calves, and the progeny of these cattle during their productive life (12 years), and the land areas, external inputs, and other natural resources and technologies necessary to the operations. The functional unit was the production of 1 kg of live weight. The values of greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and freshwater depletion in the ES were higher compared with those values obtained for the IS (22.52 and 9.16 kg CO2 equivalents; 234.78 and 21.03 m2a; and 0.217 and 0.0949 m3, respectively). These variations were attributed to the permanence time of the animals in each system and to the quality and production of the pastures. The ES presented lower potential impacts than the IS on metal depletion and soil acidification (0.000519 and 0.0536 kg Fe equivalents; and 0.0028 and 0.0038 kg SO2 equivalents, respectively) mainly due to the pasture improvement practices and the salt supply to the animals. Moreover, the values of freshwater eutrophication and fossil depletion were higher in the ES than in the IS (0.00383 and 0.00219 kg P equivalents and 0.0042 and -0.1255 kg oil equivalents, respectively). While the pasture nutrient loss from runoff and leaching defined the values of eutrophication, the introduction of legumes compensates the use of fossil fuels. The diversity of the results provides a better understanding of the environmental impacts of different production systems and of regional singularities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND Climate change has myriad implications for the health of humans, our ecosystems, and the ecological processes that sustain them. Projections of rising greenhouse gas emissions suggest increasing direct and indirect burden of infectious and noninfectious disease, effects on food and water security, and other societal disruptions. As the effects of climate change cannot be isolated from social and ecological determinants of disease that will mitigate or exacerbate forecasted health outcomes, multidisciplinary collaboration is critically needed. OBJECTIVES The aim of this article was to review the links between climate change and its upstream drivers (ie, processes leading to greenhouse gas emissions) and health outcomes, and identify existing opportunities to leverage more integrated global health and climate actions to prevent, prepare for, and respond to anthropogenic pressures. METHODS We conducted a literature review of current and projected health outcomes associated with climate change, drawing on findings and our collective expertise to review opportunities for adaptation and mitigation across disciplines. FINDINGS Health outcomes related to climate change affect a wide range of stakeholders, providing ready collaborative opportunities for interventions, which can be differentiated by addressing the upstream drivers leading to climate change or the downstream effects of climate change itself. CONCLUSIONS Although health professionals are challenged with risks from climate change and its drivers, the adverse health outcomes cannot be resolved by the public health community alone. A phase change in global health is needed to move from a passive responder in partnership with other societal sectors to drive innovative alternatives. It is essential for global health to step outside of its traditional boundaries to engage with other stakeholders to develop policy and practical solutions to mitigate disease burden of climate change and its drivers; this will also yield compound benefits that help address other health, environmental, and societal challenges. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Humans are an important component of the biophysical environment in Africa, interacting with its resources through prisms of knowledge structures to harness and manage resources sustainably. A review of the human sphere (e.g., population and migration, land and land use, agriculture, and food security) and the ecosphere (e.g., environmental change, biodiversity, water, and coastal resources) is undertaken. The review suggests an environment which is generally degraded, and blamed on biophysical processes and policy failures. Mainstreaming policies and decision-support systems of different sectors and development processes would help reduce conflicts in resource use toward maintaining the integrity of Africa's environment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Droughts occur both in developed and developing countries with significant impacts and are exacerbating in frequency, severity and duration. Over exploitation of water resources, weather variability and climate change are mostly responsible for such exacerbation. The impacts of droughts encompass the global ecosystem as a whole but vary from region to region. Least developed countries (LDCs) are becoming the worst sufferer of the impacts due to physical, social and economic as well as knowledge and skills differences. The increasing biophysical vulnerability contexts and intensity in the Asian LDCs causing adverse effects on food security, human health, biodiversity, water resources, hydroelectric power generation, streams, perennial springs, and livelihood. Drought is also responsible for increasing pollution, pests and diseases and forced migration and famine. Information indicates monsoon has become erratic contributing to up-scaling of droughts. South and Southeast Asian LDCs like Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Cambodia and Lao PDR under the monsoon climatic zone have also been suffering from increasing droughts arising out of delayed and changing distribution patterns of precipitation. Prolong dry spells increase the frequencies of wildfire in grasslands, forests, and range-lands. The rain-fed crops of the plains are facing challenges from soil-moisture stress with projected droughts. Droughts causing migration of fishes, and marine anadromus species are having adverse impacts on spawning habitats. Reduction in annual surface runoff is decreasing the ground and surface water with negative effect on agriculture and water supply for industrial and domestic sectors. As droughts are exacerbating the consequences are accelerating. However, traditionally people are adapting with the changing situations applying indigenous knowledge and practices for sustainable living. This paper reflects on prevalence and impacts of droughts, existing coping mechanisms, initiatives to combat impacts and further doubles in the context of Asian LDCs. © 2014 The Author.

AB  - In the coming decades, fishery resource managers and policy-makers in Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) will be increasingly challenged by the need to ensure food security in the context of a changing climate, increasing human pressure on the marine environment, and limited understanding of marine ecosystems and associated resources. These decision-makers must address a pressing and overarching question - how will pelagic resources and pressures on such resources change over time and space? Answering this question requires ongoing inquiry into critical dimensions of pelagic species and systems, for both the commercial tuna species that are managed by Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMOs), as well as nearshore pelagic fishes that support many small-scale fisheries and are managed at national and local levels. Research priorities include generating further insight into life history and physiology, oceanographic context, movement and migration, food webs, ecosystem dynamics and stock status. Concurrently, socioeconomic research is needed to tailor fisheries management strategies to local, national and regional conditions; and improve understanding of incentive structures among players in RFMOs such as the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. PICT-based scientists and managers are ideally situated to generate new fisheries-relevant data; however, investments are needed to expand the capacity for research, management, and sustainable fisheries development within PICTs. Such capacity building can be accelerated through collaboration between PICTs, RFMOs, and scientific centers of excellence in Distant Water Fishing Nations. Without increased capacity development, this region will be adversely affected by the impacts of climate change and less able to take advantage of opportunities for economic development. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experiences soil degradation, food and livelihood insecurity, environmental pollution and lack of access to energy. Biochar has gained international research attention, but few studies have investigated the potential of biochar to address the challenges in SSA. This paper seeks to identify and evaluate generic potential opportunities and constraints associated with biochar application in sub-Saharan Africa using Zimbabwe as case study. Specific objectives were to; (1) identify and quantify feedstocks for biochar production; (2) review literature on the biochar properties, and evaluate its potential applications in agriculture, environmental remediation and energy provision, and (3) identify research gaps, risks and constraints associated with biochar technology. Biochar feedstocks in Zimbabwe were estimated to be 9.9Mtonyr-1, predominantly derived from manure (88%) and firewood (10%). This will yield 3.5, 1.7 and 3.1Mtonyr-1 of biochar, bio-oil and synthetic gas, respectively. Land application of the 3.5Mtonyr-1 of biochar (≈63% C) would sequester approximately 2.2Mtonyr-1 of soil carbon in Zimbabwe alone, while simultaneously minimizing the environmental and public health risks, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with solid organic wastes. Biochar potentially enhances soil and crop productivity through enhanced nutrient and soil moisture availability, amelioration of acidic soils and stimulation of microbial diversity and activity. Due to its excellent adsorption properties, biochar has potential applications in industrial and environmental applications including water and wastewater treatment, remediation and revegetation of contaminated soils and water. Biochar products have energy values comparable or higher than those of traditional biomass fuels; thereby making them ideal alternative sources of energy especially for poor households without access to electricity. Before the benefits of biochar can be realized in SSA, there is need to overcome multiple risks and constraints such as lack of finance, socio-economic constraints including negative perceptions and attitudes among both researchers and consumers, and environmental and public health risks. Therefore, there is need to conduct fundamental research to demonstrate the benefits of biochar applications, and develop policy framework and criteria for its production and subsequent adoption. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Global climate and land use changes could strongly affect soil erosion and the capability of soils to sustain agriculture and in turn impact regional or global food security. The objective of our study was to develop a method to assess soil sustainability to erosion under changes in land use and climate. The method was applied in a typical mixed Mediterranean landscape in a wine-growing watershed (75km2) within the Languedoc region (La Peyne, France) for two periods: a first period with the current climate and land use and a second period with the climate and land use scenarios at the end of the twenty-first century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1B future rainfall scenarios from the Météo France General circulation model was coupled with four contrasting land use change scenarios that were designed using a spatially-explicit land use change model. Mean annual erosion rate was estimated with an expert-based soil erosion model. Soil life expectancy was assessed using soil depth. Soil erosion rate and soil life expectancy were combined into a sustainability index. The median simulated soil erosion rate for the current period was 3.5t/ha/year and the soil life expectancy was 273 years, showing a low sustainability of soils. For the future period with the same land use distribution, the median simulated soil erosion rate was 4.2t/ha/year and the soil life expectancy was 249 years. The results show that soil erosion rate and soil life expectancy are more sensitive to changes in land use than to changes in precipitation. Among the scenarios tested, institution of a mandatory grass cover in vineyards seems to be an efficient means of significantly improving soil sustainability, both in terms of decreased soil erosion rates and increased soil life expectancies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Irrigation represents one of the main strategies to enhance and stabilize agricultural productivity, by mitigating the effects of rainfall vagaries. In the face of the projected growth in population and in biofuel demands, as well as shifts in climate and dietary habits, a more sustainable management of water resources in agroecosystems is needed. The field of ecohydrology, traditionally focusing on natural ecosystems, has the potential to offer the necessary quantitative tools to assess and compare agricultural enterprises across climates, soil types, crops, and irrigation strategies, accounting for the unpredictability of the hydro-climatic forcing. Here, agricultural sustainability and productivity are assessed with reference to water productivity (defined as the ratio between yield and total supplied water), yields, water requirements, and their variability—a crucial element for food security and resource allocation planning. These synthetic indicators are quantified by means of a probabilistic description of the soil water balance and crop development. The model results allow the interpretation of patterns of water productivity observed in Zea mays (maize) and Triticum aestivum (wheat), grown under a variety of soils, climates, and irrigation strategies. Employing the same modeling framework, the impact of rainfall pattern and irrigation strategy on yield and water requirements is further explored. The obtained standard deviations of yield and water requirements suggest the existence of a nonlinear tradeoff between yield stabilization and variability of water requirements, which in turn is strongly impacted by irrigation strategy. Moreover, intermediate rainfall amounts are associated to the highest variability in yields and irrigation requirements, although allowing the maximum water productivity. The existence of these tradeoffs between productivity, reliability, and sustainability poses a problem for water management, in particular in mesic climates. © 2014, Society for Mathematical Biology.

AB  - Marine defaunation, or human-caused animal loss in the oceans, emerged forcefully only hundreds of years ago, whereas terrestrial defaunation has been occurring far longer. Though humans have caused few global marine extinctions, we have profoundly affected marine wildlife, altering the functioning and provisioning of services in every ocean. Current ocean trends, coupled with terrestrial defaunation lessons, suggest that marine defaunation rates will rapidly intensify as human use of the oceans industrializes. Though protected areas are a powerful tool to harness ocean productivity, especially when designed with future climate in mind, additional management strategies will be required. Overall, habitat degradation is likely to intensify as a major driver of marine wildlife loss. Proactive intervention can avert a marine defaunation disaster of the magnitude observed on land. © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Grasslands cover a total of 52.5 million km2, or about 40% of the world’s icefree land area (White et al., 2000). The total biomass of the plant life found in grasslands accounts for about one-third of all land vegetation (Mooney et al., 2001). Grasslands are an important part of the greater terrestrial ecosystem, serving as an important ecological barrier, playing a role in climate regulation, and contributing to global and regional ecosystem balance (Chen and Jiang, 2003; Lu et al., 2009). They provide significant ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation, regulation of the quantity and quality of water flows, sandstorm abatement and erosion and desertification control; they also serve an important function as a carbon sink (carbon stored in live vegetation), accounting for approximately one-sixth of the total global carbon biomass stock and a quarter of global soil carbon stock (de Fries et al., 1999; Mooney et al., 2001). In addition to their ecological importance, grasslands make up nearly 70% of all land used for agriculture worldwide (Suttie et al., 2005) and are a key productive resource for hundreds of millions of pastoralists who depend on grasslands for their livelihoods.1 More than 40% of China’s land area is grassland (Zhang, 2000; Chen et al., 2003), from the arid north-west and green meadows in the north and north-east to alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau and tropical or subtropical pastures in the south. Sheep, goats, cattle, horses and donkeys are raised on grasslands across China, sustaining the livelihoods of more than 35 million pastoralists (Liu, 2012) and contributing to food security for the whole country. Yet grasslands are very sensitive to changes in climate. They are complex ecosystems that rely on a balanced interaction between weather, sunlight, soil and water conditions, grazing animals and humans, and they are very sensitive to changes in any one of these factors. Even small changes can have significant effects on grassland biomass (the total dry weight of the plant life above and below ground in a specific area) production, species diversity and ecosystem services, all of which directly affect the livestock and the people that depend on them. As China’s temperatures continue to increase, and precipitation and weather patterns become more varied and more extreme (see Chapters 3 and 9), grasslands may see far-reaching changes in their size, condition (assessed by the proportion of a grassland covered by vegetation, plant diversity or biomass production) and ability to sustain life. For China, grassland-climate change impacts will be significant. Zhao Taihou is a herdsman raising more than 700 sheep on the grasslands of Siziwang Banner in Inner Mongolia. His livelihood is heavily dependent on the natural world; environmental and climate variability directly impact his family’s finances. There is a grazing ban in place on his summer pastures, but he can still collect grass and let his flock graze on his winter pastures. He is happiest when the grass grows well and his sheep have plenty to eat. Zhao’s primary concern is inadequate rain in summer and too much snow in winter. So far, he has been able to increase his flock’s resilience to extreme weather by installing pens that give his sheep some protection against the elements, but Zhao is likely to have to prepare for other changes to come. ‘To adapt to climate change, we have to reduce the number of livestock, but it will mean less income,’ he says. ‘We could also store more fodder each year. For example, we had 30 tonnes hoarded up for last winter. It would also help if we could dig a well so that we can water the fodder growing in the pastures.’ As with Zhao Taihou, many pastoralists in China depend on grasslands and their associated ecosystem services for their livelihoods and cultural identities (see Chapter 9). Changes in these delicate ecosystems could have devastating effects on a country carefully balancing the sustainability of its food production with the growing demand for food resources from an ever-increasing population. Thus, projecting and adapting to the potential effects of climate change on grasslands is necessary for China’s long-term sustainable development and social stability. This chapter provides an overview of China’s grasslands, some of the recent historical trends in their use and development, and the potential effects of climate change on grasslands and livestock production. It also discusses some of the recent research and work done to assess the impacts and risks of climate change to grasslands, using research from the Adapting to Climate Change in China I (ACCC I) programme as a case study. The chapter then summarises relevant policies related to mainstreaming climate adaptation considerations into grassland management and activities – being undertaken spontaneously by herders and promoted by various provincial governments in response to national-level policy guidance – to increase the ecological resilience of grasslands and the livelihoods of herders. © 2016 Rebecca Nadin, Sarah Opitz-Stapleton and Xu Yinlong.

AB  - The ocean influences nearly all activities on the planet, serving as a source of nutrition, energy and pathway for transport of resources while buffering the scale of variations in climate. It is also the portion of the planet that is perhaps in greatest need of data to address issues of the dramatic changes that are happening globally. Some of the changes are clearly the result of human inaction and lack of foresight. Fisheries, on which one sixth of human protein nutrition is derived, are in a state of near collapse for some species in the near term, owing to overfishing and mismanagement of a sustainable infrastructure. Lack of cautious application of new technologies and oversight has led to increasing levels of pollutants, sometimes catastrophically, as was evidenced in the recent Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Global warming is influencing many aspects of the ocean system and will have collateral impacts beyond simply raising the temperature of the planet. Navigation and influence on transport are chief in our envisioning eventual impacts, and need to be anticipated, based on the best of models and data. Sea level rise and the associated coastal erosion, modifying waterways and ports, call for adaptive planning. Climate change could easily be seen to affect ocean circulation, wind dynamics, storm production and associated storm surges. Loss of sea ice in the Arctic will open new avenues which are economically and energetically more efficient for transport. With warming, and heightened destruction of ice sheets will likely come increased hazards from sea ice in shipping lanes. The rate of loss of the ice sheets such as that of Greenland is only beginning to be understood, and appears to be increasing. Sea ice coverage in the Arctic was the lowest on record in the summer of 2012, and the area of surface melt on the Greenland Ice Sheet was recorded at the highest, at 97%, since satellite images have documented its status. Diminishing ice cover will also influence an increase of fishing efforts and exploration for fossil fuels in the high Arctic. Without precise data on the sizes of fish stocks, the effects on commercial fisheries are complex, and beg for fundamental knowledge. Additionally, with the loss of sea ice, diminishing ice-based productivity may lead to a loss of diversity and modification of sustainable trophic structure in Arctic food webs. As a consequence of increased fossil fuel exploration, extraction and transport, the risk of contamination is heightened and at present only minimal preparation for impact and cleanup exists for this eventuality in fragile Arctic environments. The addition of massive amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and oceans, has changed the ocean chemistry, increasing the acidity or lowering the pH. Sound propagation in a more acid ocean may affect navigation as well as migration patterns of marine mammals and fish. Acidification influence on calcareous organisms at primary production levels could lead to catastrophic effects on the higher organisms of the food chains. The collateral impacts of the changing ocean in a period of global warming urgently require further study in order to enable adaptation and reduce vulnerability. Only through an appreciation for the past and a comprehensive understanding of the present, can we anticipate the future. The potential for that vision of the ocean lies with the cooperation among all nations. Copyright © 2016 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands. All rights reserved.

AB  - The holistic study of soils requires an interdisciplinary approach involving biologists, chemists, geologists, and physicists, amongst others, something that has been true from the earliest days of the field. In more recent years this list has grown to include anthropologists, economists, engineers, medical professionals, military professionals, sociologists, and even artists. This approach has been strengthened and reinforced as current research continues to use experts trained in both soil science and related fields and by the wide array of issues impacting the world that require an in-depth understanding of soils. Of fundamental importance amongst these issues are biodiversity, biofuels/energy security, climate change, ecosystem services, food security, human health, land degradation, and water security, each representing a critical challenge for research. In order to establish a benchmark for the type of research that we seek to publish in each issue of SOIL, we have outlined the interdisciplinary nature of soil science research we are looking for. This includes a focus on the myriad ways soil science can be used to expand investigation into a more holistic and therefore richer approach to soil research. In addition, a selection of invited review papers are published in this first issue of SOIL that address the study of soils and the ways in which soil investigations are essential to other related fields. We hope that both this editorial and the papers in the first issue will serve as examples of the kinds of topics we would like to see published in SOIL and will stimulate excitement among our readers and authors to participate in this new venture. © Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Rapidly rising demand for food, raw materials, and energy is leading to intensifying human environmental footprints locally, nationally, and globally. This has consequences for the health of ecosystems and the services these provide. By considering the complex socio-economic interactions between the water, carbon-energy, food production, and climate cycles, UNESCO’s Natural Science Programme (principally through its International Hydrological Programme and the Man and Biosphere Programme) promotes trans-disciplinary approaches to help restore, enhance, and protect the sustainability of land and water systems. This new book, in the International Hydrology Series, is well aligned with the aims and objectives of UNESCO’s International Hydrological Programme by furthering the understanding and championing the potential of the ecosystem services-based approaches. Phase VIII (2014-2021) of the Programme is focused on ‘Water security: responses to local, regional, and global challenges’ and has a special theme on ‘Ecohydrology, engineering harmony for sustainable world’, to which this book is of direct relevance. The UNESCO Ecohydrology initiative involves the development of tools that integrate basin-wide human activities with hydrological cycles in order to sustain, improve, and restore the ecological functions of, and services in, river basins and coastal zones as a basis to support positive socio-economic development. Experiences gained through previous phases of the International Hydrological Programme, have shown that freshwater availability will become a major concern if no immediate action is taken to restore and enhance the associated ecosystems. Therefore, the knowledge presented in this book adds great value to inform global efforts on ensuring water security through UNESCO’s ongoing initiatives at the river basin level, such as the Hydrology for the Environment, Life and Policy, Ecohydrology and Integrated Water Resources Management Guidelines. The Hydrology for the Environment, Life and Policy in river basins initiative aims to deliver social, economic, and environmental benefits to stakeholders through research towards the sustainable use of water for human and environmental purposes. © UNESCO 2015.

AB  - Such evolutions must cope with climate change (characterized by changing rainfall patterns and an increasing number of extreme weather events) and its consequences (changing distributions of plant and vector-borne diseases, and increased crop yield variability), more competition for land (increased competition between food and bioenergy production), and the associated increased environmental pressures (e.g., overexploitation of ground water resources, water quality degradation, and soil degradation). As a consequence, in addition to the need to increase crop production, another major agricultural challenge is the task of improving the management of natural resources, especially through the adoption of more environmental-friendly practices, such as ecological intensication or conservation agriculture. Major agricultural powers such as Europe and Brazil have launched ambitious programs, for example, the Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) guidelines and the ABC Program (Brazilian Low Carbon Agriculture Program), respectively. xese programs give a special role to multifunctional landscapes to establish sustainable agriculture. Landscapes must be considered a whole land use system at the heart of human-nature relationships that need to be efficiently managed to preserve and restore ecosystem services (DeFries and Rosenzweig, 2010), and to contribute to sustainable solutions, especially regarding food security challenges (Verburg et al., 2013). In view of these global challenges, there is an urgent need to better characterize agricultural systems at the regional and global scales, with a particular emphasis on the various pathways toward agricultural intensification. Those systems are the key to understanding land use sustainability in agricultural territories. © 2016 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - According to Europe 2020 strategy, a sustainable, more competitive, and greener economy is regarded as development that meets the today needs without compromising the needs of the future generations. The new green growth is to be based on a low carbon, climate resilient, and resource-efficient economy, minimizing waste and pollution and protecting-restoring the earth ecosystem. In addition a green economy can create new jobs trying to solve both the EU problem of youth unemployment and the preservation of natural resources by the use of waste material from animal and plant biomass. Young people, in fact, are the group most adaptable to the changes, easily accepting jobs in the new and unexplored areas of bionanotechnologies, by the use of industrial by-products representing ∼300 billion/year of unused available and precious raw materials. Thus, the green economy has been recognized as a potential source of employment and a contributor to economic recovery, representing both a challenge and an opportunity for the labour market and the environment preservation. MAVI as producer of Chitin Nanofibrils (CN), obtained from the crustacean waste by a green technology, has been involved in different EU research projects to produce innovative biocomposites for pharmaceutical and cosmetic use and/or food packaging. By the Biomimetic project (www.biomimetic-eu-project.eu/) innovative emulsions and non-woven beauty masks have been realized; by Chitofarma (www.mavicosmetics.it) advanced medications have been made by biodegradable non-woven tissues; by n-Chitopack (www.n-Chitopack.eu) different food packaging have been made completely biodegradable and compostable. It is to underline that all the projects, based on the production of green biocomposites, have been based on the use of crystal-CN and other natural polymers, all obtained from waste material by a low consume of energy and water, according to the EU, OECD, and UNEP guidelines. The origin of chitin and its crystallinity has determined, in fact, the structure, morphology and the particular properties of CN used as filler, as well as the other bio-based polymers have represented the matrix of the composites obtained into the university of Pisa. In conclusion the different green products resulting from the projects will be shown by this paper, focusing the discussion on the present necessity for a sustainable development. A green economy in fact, implies not only a right economic, social and environmental development but also a bettering of the quality of life, through education and training in line with labour market demands, and human knowledge. At this purpose it is to remember that a young-looking is psychologically connected with the necessity to show a healthy appearance also. Thus, a healthy and beauty body, as well as an increased and ameliorated education is one of the priorities of the EU 2020 strategy, along with labour productivity growth, lower unemployment, better insertion of young people in the labour market, increasing public participation in education, and lifelong learning. Recent EU studies reported, in fact, that by 2020 2.8 million jobs are expected to be created by the green economy.

AB  - Green Infrastructure is the network of green spaces and water systems that delivers multiple environmental, social and economic values and services to urban communities. This living network strengthens the resilience of urban environments to respond to the major current and future challenges of climate change, growth, health and biodiversity loss, as well as water, energy and food security. With the rapid expansion of towns and cities around the world, the far-reaching value of Green Infrastructure is increasingly recognised by scientific, planning and design communities. A key strategy area of the South Australian Green Infrastructure Project has been development of a sound and credible evidence base to demonstrate the multiple benefits and make the case for investment in Green Infrastructure. A review of local and global literature, with an emphasis on the most recent peer-reviewed research, was carried out between 2012 and 2014. The body of evidence firmly establishes the many and diverse benefits of Green Infrastructure. These include modification of temperatures and climatic conditions, improved human health and well-being, enhanced community liveability, more effective water management, increased economic prosperity, greater opportunity for biodiversity conservation and more extensive urban food production. The primary focus of this paper is the contribution of Green Infrastructure to climate adaptation and protection. © 2015 Royal Society of South Australia.

AB  - The growth of tourism in the Philippines can be largely attributed to nature-based destinations but communities in these areas largely depend on farming and fishing to sustain their day-to-day needs. The need to capacitate the community's social and human capital in addressing climate change impacts to their livelihood, properties and natural environment is deemed necessary to lessen their vulnerability issues in the management of agriecotourism destinations. The study aimed to 1.) characterize and rank hazards that are likely to affect the nature-based tourism communities, 2.) describe the nature-based tourism communities' current sensitivity and exposure to climate stresses; and 3.) estimate future vulnerability and risks of nature-based tourism communities. Three agri-ecotourism communities were selected using five criteria such as attraction uniqueness, hazard type, risk level, tourism dependency and market potential. The areas were subjected to tourism vulnerability case assessment focusing on services and energy; human health; food, security, water and agriculture; business and continuity; and biodiversity and culture. Calaguas Island's top hazards are typhoon, drought and strong wind. Pecuaria Farm's main hazards are drought, rat infestation and grass fire while Bulusan Lake's major hazards are heavy rains and ash falls brought by volcanic eruption. Generally, vulnerability is high in the human health, services and energy sectors of tourism. The vulnerability of the three agri-ecotourism sites was intensified by factors that merely characterize the kind of community they have: a) high marketing dependency, b) poor political will, c) low level of awareness and preparedness, d) poor farming practices and e) lack of tourism-related livelihood options. Destinations with functioning agricultural areas are the most affected sites due to an estimated increase in the temperature and increase in rainfall precipitations. Poverty remains to be the major factor why vulnerability is high.

AB  - In the years since publication of the first edition of Food Wars much has happened in the world of food policy. This new edition brings these developments fully up to date within the original analytical framework of competing paradigms or worldviews shaping the direction and decision-making within food politics and policy. The key theme of the importance of integrating human and environmental health has become even more pressing. In the first edition the authors set out and brought together the different strands of emerging agendas and competing narratives. The second edition retains the same core structure and includes updated examples, case studies and the new issues which show how these conflicting tendencies have played out in practice over recent years and what this tells us about the way the global food system is heading. Examples of key issues given increased attention include: • Nutrition, including the global rise in obesity, as well as chronic conditions, hunger and under-nutrition • The environment, particularly the challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss, water stress and food security • Food industry concentration and market power • Volatility and uncertainty over food prices and policy responses • Tensions over food, democracy and citizenship • Social and cultural aspects impacting food and nutrition policies. © 2015 Tim Lang and Michael Heasman.

The North American Arctic region is assessed in Chapter 28: Polar Regions. North America ranges from the tropics to frozen tundra, and contains a diversity of topography, ecosystems, economies, governance structures, and cultures. As a result, risk and vulnerability to climate variability and change differ considerably across the continent depending on geography, scale, hazard, socio-ecological systems, ecosystems, demographic sectors, cultural values, and institutional settings. This chapter seeks to take account of this diversity and complexity as it affects and is projected to affect vulnerabilities, impacts, risks, and adaptation across North America. No single chapter would be adequate to cover the range and scope of the literature about climate change vulnerabilities, impacts, and adaptations in the three focus countries of this assessment. (Interested readers are encouraged to review these reports: Lemmen et al., 2008; INECC and SEMARNAT, 2012a; NCADAC, 2013.) We therefore attempt to take a more integrative and innovative approach. In addition to describing current and future climatic and socioeconomic trends of relevance to understanding risk and vulnerability in North America (Section 26.2), we contrast climate impacts, vulnerabilities, and adaptations across and within the three countries in the following key sectors: water resources and management(Section 26.3); ecosystems and biodiversity (Section 26.4); agriculture and food security (Section 26.5); human health (Section 26.6); and key economic sectors and services (Section 26.7). We use a comparative and place-based approach to explore the factors and processes associated with differences and commonalities in vulnerability, risk, and adaptation between urban and rural settlements (Section 26.8); and to illustrate and contrast the nuanced challenges and opportunities adaption entails at the city, subnational, and national levels (Sections 26.8.4, 26.9; Box 26-3). We highlight two case studies that cut across sectors, systems, or national boundaries. © Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2014.

AB  - The health of populations depends on the availability of clean air, water, food, and sanitation, exposure to pathogens, toxins and environmental hazards, and numerous genetic, behavioral and social factors. For many thousands of years, human life expectancy was low, and population growth was slow. The development of technology-based civilizations facilitated what Abdel Omran called "epidemiological transition," with increasing life expectancy and rapid population growth. To a large extent, the spectacular growth of human populations during the past two centuries was made possible by the energy extracted from fossil fuels. We have now learned, however, that greenhouse gases from fossil fuel combustion are warming the planet's surface, causing changes in oceanic and atmospheric systems, and disrupting weather and hydrological patterns. Climate change poses unprecedented threats to human health by impacts on food and water security, heat waves and droughts, violent storms, infectious disease, and rising sea levels. Whether or not humanity can reduce greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to slow climate change to a rate that will allow societies to successfully adapt is not yet known. This essay reviews the current state of relevant knowledge, and points in a few directions that those interested in human health may wish to consider. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems (seas, oceans, rivers and lakes) cover >70% of the Earth's surface and play essential roles in geochemical cycling and climate regulation. They are also hugely important for human health, nutrition and economy, providing drinking water, food, transport and leisure resources. These environments harbour complex and cryptic ecosystems dominated in terms of abundance and biomass by planktonic microbes including bacteria, archaea, viruses and eukaryotic organisms (such as protists and fungi). These organisms form numerous and diverse interactions encompassing all kind of exchanges, e.g. predator–prey relationships and all shades of symbiosis from commensalism to parasitism. © Cambridge University Press 2015.

AB  - Climate change has significantly impacted tropical ecosystems critical for sustaining local economies and community livelihoods at global scales. Coastal ecosystems have largely declined, threatening the principal source of protein, building materials, tourism-based revenue, and the first line of defense against storm swells and sea level rise (SLR) for small tropical islands. Climate change has also impacted public health (i.e., altered distribution and increased prevalence of allergies, water-borne, and vector-borne diseases). Rapid human population growth has exacerbated pressure over coupled social-ecological systems, with concomitant non-sustainable impacts on natural resources, water availability, food security and sovereignty, public health, and quality of life, which should increase vulnerability and erode adaptation and mitigation capacity. This paper examines cumulative and synergistic impacts of climate change in the challenging context of highly vulnerable small tropical islands. Multiple adaptive strategies of coupled social-ecological ecosystems are discussed. Multi-level, multi-sectorial responses are necessary for adaptation to be successful. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The recovery and reuse of wastewater can contribute to reducing poverty, improving food security, improving nutrition and health, and managing natural resources more sustainability to protect ecosystems and build climate resilient communities. Reusing wastewater generates both private and public benefits, yet care must be taken to minimize environmental harm and risks to human health. Assessing the costs and benefits of wastewater use is challenging for decision making. Financial analysis of wastewater and other reuse options can underpin decision making from a business standpoint, and economic analysis provides the information needed to support public policy decisions. In this chapter, we provide a framework for assessing the finance and economics of wastewater and other reuse options. We examine several components of resource recovery and reuse, including water reuse, energy recovery, and nutrient capture from wastewater as well as fecal sludge and biosolids. We describe the cost-savings and partial cost-recovery made possible by wastewater use and we discuss value propositions for possible business models. Many water reuse solutions do not achieve financial cost recovery but are viable from an economic perspective. However, public agencies can enhance revenue streams by supporting more than water recovery and/or by targeting high-end users. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.

AB  - Rajasthan, with its climate ranging from arid to semi-arid to sub-humid, and rapidly depleting natural resources, is already experiencing the effects of climate change. The region’s climate is projected to become harsher, with increased average temperatures, intensity of rainfall events, and increased variability in space & time of monsoon rains being consistently projected for the region. Without action in the form of adaptation of social, human, economic, and natural resource management systems, these weather changes are predicted to result in decreasing surface and ground water availability, flash floods, degradation of soil resources, decrease in crop yields, greater vulnerability to crop pest outbreaks, and declines in forest and pastureland ecosystem goods and services, thus rendering agricultural and herding communities extremely vulnerable to weather related losses of life, livelihood, and food security. In Rajasthan, government is focussing for sustainable development and climate change adaptation by finding and administering alternative methods to deal with issues of poverty and environmental degradation in context of linkage between livelihood and the immediate environment of the people. The livelihoods of the rural poor are directly dependent on environmental resources like land, water, forests — and are vulnerable to weather and climate variability. Climate change affects every aspect of society, environment and economy requiring adjustments in behaviour, livelihoods, infrastructure, laws, policies and institutions in response to experienced based expected climatic events. However, it was found that local coping strategies and traditional knowledge need to be used in synergy with government and local interventions. Solutions must be integrated to address the interrelationships between water, agriculture, forests and pastures, livestock. Finally, there is great potential for existing policies and schemes to be employed synergistically towards building true adaptive capacity for the rural communities. However, adapting to climate change will entail adjustments and implementation at every level – from community to national and international. © 2015 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

AB  - Environmental policy discussion is replete with references to water security, food security, ecosystem health, community resilience, sustainable development, and sustainable urbanism. These terms are, by their very nature, ambiguous and difficult to define; they allow room, however, for a variety of actors to conceptualize water, food, ecological, economic, and urban problems in ways that allow them to move forward on contentious issues. This article focuses on the idea of water security and asks how it is conceptualized and used for regional policy debate in western Canada. We asked fifty-eight water stakeholders from the Saskatchewan River Basin to define water security, identify major barriers to security, and prioritize water problems. Responses showed there are myriad ways to think about water security, ranging from narrow conceptualizations, such as reliability, quality, and quantity, to broader sustainability perspectives about the nature of resource development and its social and economic consequences. The human dimensions of water security (governance, land use, and competing demands) were assigned higher priority than its biophysical aspects (flooding, droughts, and climate change). Framing water security to emphasize the human capacity to manage uncertain and rapid biophysical and societal change offers the opportunity to unite actors who otherwise would be separated by core environmental values, definitions of water security, provincial context (Alberta vs. Saskatchewan), and occupation. © Copyright 2015 by Association of American Geographers.

AB  - Horticultural products and services impact the health and well-being of Urban populations. This is an extremely important group for horticultural scientists and researchers to serve: more than half of all people worldwide already live in Urban areas, and more than two-thirds will do so by 2050. In this chapter we address the past, current, and future roles that horticultural science plays in the major issues of concern to public welfare: public health, environmental health, food security, and economic stability. Urban horticulture has important impacts on the health of the individual and the community, two concerns of public health. Documented individual health benefits include less depression and improved pregnancy outcomes from walking in or living near Urban green spaces. Community gardens, parks, and other Urban vegetation enhance community health by improving social interactions, such as family dynamics, and public safety, such as protection from crimes. Uses of plants to improve the Urban environment include temperature modification, air pollution reduction, and water quality improvement. Impacts on biological diversity are mixed. Other negative impacts include the introduction of invasive species. Urban food security requires food in sufficient, nutritious, and affordable quantities. Providing this for all people is one of the greatest challenges for horticultural science. Potential solutions include increasing small-scale food production in Urban areas by providing more community gardens or converting vacant lots. Horticulture contributes directly to Urban economics through the production and sales of horticultural products by Urban businesses. Indirect contributions from plants include higher property values and more productive employees. The increasing urbanization and aging of the human population is happening in conjunction with rising environmental destruction from global warming and climate change. Combining the traditional horticultural concern of feeding the world with an expanded understanding of the additional functions provided by horticultural products, the needs of Urban people, and the opportunities to partner with professionals in other disciplines will be essential in the unpredictable future. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Nutrition is affected by numerous environmental and societal causes. This paper starts with a simple framework based on three domains: nutritional quality, economic viability, and environmental sustainability, and calls for an integrated approach in research to simultaneously account for all three. It highlights limitations in the current understanding of each domain, and how they influence one another. Five research topics are identified: measuring the three domains (nutritional quality, economic viability, environmental sustainability); modeling across disciplines; furthering the analysis of food systems in relation to the three domains; connecting climate change and variability to nutritional quality; and increasing attention to inequities among population groups in relation to the three domains. For an integrated approach to be developed, there is a need to identify and disseminate available metrics, modeling techniques, and tools to researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. This is a first step so that a systems approach that takes into account potential environmental and economic trade-offs becomes the norm in analyzing nutrition and food-security patterns. Such an approach will help fill critical knowledge gaps and will guide researchers seeking to define and address specific research questions in nutrition in their wider socioeconomic and environmental contexts. © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The coastal area of Bangladesh has been a focus of climate change and hazard research due to its extreme vulnerability to tropical cyclones, often leading to disaster. While there have been recent studies on the nature of these disasters, people's vulnerability and responses, little is known about how other key stresses, interacting with these extreme weather events, impact natural resources and the flow of ecosystem services that sustain local livelihoods. In this paper, we explore the process by which major stresses and hazards shape the vulnerability of people's livelihoods in dynamic social-ecological environments in the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh. Drawing on qualitative and quantitative data from a case study, we identify the key drivers of change in social-ecological systems and evaluate whether these drivers have affected livelihood outcomes and various components of human wellbeing. This analysis suggests that increasing salinity intrusion, tropical cyclone and land-use change (directly and through changes in ecosystem services) affect the access to livelihood assets at household scale. This undermines social wellbeing by seriously impacting food and water security. Through identification of key stresses and their interactions, and the consequent impacts on ecosystems services and household capitals, the current study proposes a conceptual framework to understand the present day vulnerability to multiple stressors in the context of the coastal region of Bangladesh. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ruminant livestock provides meat and dairy products that sustain health and livelihood for much of the world's population. Grazing lands that support ruminant livestock provide numerous ecosystem services, including provision of food, water, and genetic resources; climate and water regulation; support of soil formation; nutrient cycling; and cultural services. In the U.S. southern Great Plains, beef production on pastures, rangelands, and hay is a major economic activity. The region's climate is characterized by extremes of heat and cold and extremes of drought and flooding. Grazing lands occupy a large portion of the region's land, significantly affecting carbon, nitrogen, and water budgets. To understand vulnerabilities and enhance resilience of beef production, a multi-institutional Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP), the "grazing CAP," was established. Integrative research and extension spanning biophysical, socioeconomic, and agricultural disciplines address management effects on productivity and environmental footprints of production systems. Knowledge and tools being developed will allow farmers and ranchers to evaluate risks and increase resilience to dynamic conditions. The knowledge and tools developed will also have relevance to grazing lands in semiarid and subhumid regions of the world. © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Nations in the 21st century face a complex mix of environmental and social challenges, as highlighted by the on-going Sustainable Development Goals process. The "planetary boundaries" concept [Rockström J, et al. (2009) Nature 461(7263):472-475], and its extension through the addition of social well-being indicators to create a framework for "safe and just" inclusive sustainable development [Raworth K (2012) Nature Climate Change 2(4):225-226], have received considerable attention in science and policy circles. As the chief aim of this framework is to influence public policy, and this happens largely at the national level, we assess whether it can be used at the national scale, using South Africa as a test case. We developed a decision-based methodology for downscaling the framework and created a national "barometer" for South Africa, combining 20 indicators and boundaries for environmental stress and social deprivation. We find that it is possible to maintain the original design and concept of the framework while making it meaningful in the national context, raising new questions and identifying priority areas for action. Our results show that South Africa has exceeded its environmental boundaries for biodiversity loss, marine harvesting, freshwater use, and climate change, and social deprivation is most severe in the areas of safety, income, and employment. Trends since 1994 show improvement in nearly all social indicators, but progression toward or over boundaries for most environmental indicators. The barometer shows that achieving inclusive sustainable development in South Africa requires national and global action on multiple fronts, and careful consideration of the interplay between different environmental domains and development strategies. © 2014, National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Resilient ecosystems are vital to human well-being and are increasingly recognised as critical to supporting communities’ efforts to adapt to climate change. The governing bodies of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are encouraging parties to adopt ‘ecosystem-based adaptation’ (EbA) approaches, which utilise biodiversity and ecosystem services to support climate change adaptation. These approaches are wide ranging and include mangrove restoration to buffer against storm surges; watershed management to protect against droughts and floods; rangeland management to prevent desertification; and sustainable management of fisheries and forests to ensure food security. This article examines the emergence of EbA in international legal frameworks for climate change and biodiversity and progress towards implementation. The EbA concept is potentially powerful in catalysing international and national commitments to act due to its key defining features of a focus on societal adaptation rather than ecocentricism, and a targeting of the immediate adaptation needs of the poorest and most vulnerable communities who are adversely affected by climate change. However, examination of national policy and practice in two least developed countries, Samoa and Cambodia, reveals that institutional and legal barriers at national level can pose significant challenges to operationalising EbA to achieve adaptation objectives. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Ever since people have utilised natural resources, environmental quality has started to deteriorate. The increasing incidences of air pollution, water pollution, land and soil pollution, solid and hazardous waste pollution, deforestation, soil erosion, silting and flooding are illustrations of environmental quality deterioration. The deteriorating quality of the environment slowly, but steadily, poses a threat to human security. These threats include increasing exposure to infectious diseases, water scarcity, food scarcity, natural disasters and population displacement. Taken together, they may represent the greatest public health challenge humanity has ever faced. There always seem to be intermediaries connecting the change in the ecosystem and human health. For example, such environmental changes as climate change, land degradation and aquifer depletion seriously affect agricultural production. Agricultural production is a major determinant of nutritional status and population health. Hence, human health is affected by producing or consuming agricultural products and not directly by land degradation or aquifer depletion. However, there are some environmental changes that directly affect the quality of human health, such as a rise in temperature, which causes thermal stresses, respiratory problems and deterioration of aquatic ecosystems leading to waterborne diseases. Other health impacts of the ecosystem degradation may be exacerbated by changes in other systems and processes, such as proliferation of bacteria, distribution of vector organisms or quality and availability of water supplies. The significant changes in health conditions and emergence of new diseases require understanding and are calling for new solutions in implementation of environmental health policies. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The human influence on the global hydrological cycle is now the dominant force behind changes in water resources across the world and in regulating the resilience of the Earth system. The rise in human pressures on global freshwater resources is in par with other anthropogenic changes in the Earth system (from climate to ecosystem change), which has prompted science to suggest that humanity has entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. This paper focuses on the critical role of water for resilience of social-ecological systems across scales, by avoiding major regime shifts away from stable environmental conditions, and in safeguarding life-support systems for human wellbeing. It highlights the dramatic increase of water crowding: near-future challenges for global water security and expansion of food production in competition with carbon sequestration and biofuel production. It addresses the human alterations of rainfall stability, due to both land-use changes and climate change, the ongoing overuse of blue water, reflected in river depletion, expanding river basin closure, groundwater overexploitation and water pollution risks. The rising water turbulence in the Anthropocene changes the water research and policy agenda, from a water-resource efficiency to a water resilience focus. This includes integrated land and water stewardship to sustain wetness-dependent ecological functions at the landscape scale and a stronger emphasis on green water management for ecosystem services. A new paradigm of water governance emerges, encouraging land-use practices that explicitly take account of the multifunctional roles of water, with adequate attention to planetary freshwater boundaries and cross-scale interactions. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - The notion of travelling to open doors onto different perspectives is an antidote to living, working and socializing in spaces mediated by technologically designed artifacts. Interfaces have become ubiquitous and relationships and styles of communication have changed in keeping with this ever-present trend. The Bachelors in Technology design students, from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, have shared their concerns through their design research problems in exactly these areas. Questions regarding water safety, food security, air quality, sewerage management, marginalisation of people with disability, cultural specificity being erased by generic digital content arose; it became clear that the fragile threads connecting the ecosystem to the human system need nurturing. From an internal landscape to an external one, these students apply themselves creatively and intellectually in order to tackle real problems proactively; to talk less and do more. To this end, a sizable art installation piece has been conceptualized and constructed which will be unveiled with an accompanying performance piece at the 13th Participatory Design Conference (PDC) in Namibia, in October 2014.

AB  - The greatest challenge for agriculture is to reduce the trade-offs between productivity and long-term sustainability. Therefore, it is interesting to analyse organic agriculture which is a given set of farm practices that emphasise ecological sustainability. Organic agriculture can be characterised as being less driven by off-farm inputs and being better embedded in ecosystem functions. The literature on public goods and non-commodity outputs of organic farms is overwhelming. Most publications address the positive effects of organic farming on soil fertility, biodiversity maintenance and protection of the natural resources of soil, water and air. As a consequence of focusing on public goods, organic agriculture is less productive. Meta-analyses show that organic agriculture yields range between 0·75 and 0·8 of conventional agriculture. Best practice examples from disadvantaged sites and climate conditions show equal or, in the case of subsistence farming in Sub-Saharan Africa, higher productivity of organic agriculture. Hence, organic agriculture is likely to be a good model for productive and sustainable food production. Underfunding in R&D addressing specific bottlenecks of organic agriculture are the main cause for both crop and livestock yield gaps. Therefore, the potential for improving the performance of organic agriculture through agricultural research is huge. Although organic farming is a niche in most countries, it is at the verge of becoming mainstream in leading European countries. Consumer demand has grown over the past two decades and does not seem to be a limiting factor for the future development of organic agriculture. © The Authors 2014.

AB  - In recent decades, perspectives on the integrated social-ecological aspects of natural resource problems have become increasingly influential as traditional national security outlooks have expanded to include environmental and human concerns. However, China has not been influenced much by new environmental security frameworks. An overview of six main stressors - ecosystem degradation, food security, energy, water, urbanization, and climate change - that affect security in China reveals that current policies need to be reformed. China's ecosystems remain subject to widespread degradation, food supply is under stress, energy demand is growing rapidly, there are increasing conflicts over water quality and quantity, urbanization cannot proceed without fundamental environmental and social reforms, and climate-change impacts are projected to intensify. To resolve such security issues, China's leaders must depend less on technological solutions and should instead craft adaptive management reforms to address the lack of interdisciplinary problem-solving, low institutional capacity, and gaps between policy and implementation. © The Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Over the past 50 years, considerable effort has been made by state and national agencies as well as other partners to minimize the establishment and spread of newly introduced and/or emerging invasive plants through single agency-led programmes, inter-agency councils and task forces and, most recently, the landscape approach to early detection and rapid response (EDRR). Examples of single agency-led programmes include the USDA-Carolinas Witchweed Eradication Program in the USA and the Kochia Eradication Project in Western Australia (EDRR 1.0). In recent years, state inter-agency councils and task forces have been formed to address all types of new invasive species - particularly newly introduced species that are not already regulated by federal or state agencies. Th e Delaware Invasive Species Council, the Ontario Invasive Plant Council and the Beach Vitex Task Force are good examples of this new trend in inter-agency partnering (EDRR 2.0). Th e landscape approach to EDRR involves the development of EDRR capacity at all levels of the landscape - local to national. It includes individual public and private land units, geographic land units (watersheds, biomes, corridors, etc.) and political land units (towns, counties, states/ provinces and nations) (EDRR 3.0). From a societal standpoint, due to global climate change and increased global trade and travel, it is important to emphasize that the impacts of invasive species on food security, human health, and biodiversity will continue to increase unless steps are taken now to minimize their introduction, establishment and spread. Development of EDRR capacity at all levels of the landscape is a proven strategy for achieving those goals. © CAB International 2014.

AB  - Over 1.3 billion people live on tropical coasts, primarily in developing countries. Many depend on adjacent coastal seas for food, and livelihoods. We show how trends in demography and in several local and global anthropogenic stressors are progressively degrading capacity of coastal waters to sustain these people. Far more effective approaches to environmental management are needed if the loss in provision of ecosystem goods and services is to be stemmed. We propose expanded use of marine spatial planning as a framework for more effective, pragmatic management based on ocean zones to accommodate conflicting uses. This would force the holistic, regional-scale reconciliation of food security, livelihoods, and conservation that is needed. Transforming how countries manage coastal resources will require major change in policy and politics, implemented with sufficient flexibility to accommodate societal variations. Achieving this change is a major challenge - one that affects the lives of one fifth of humanity. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to describe the conduct and outcomes of an integrated assessment (IA) of the vulnerability to climate change of government service provision at regional scale in New South Wales, Australia. The assessment was co-designed with regional public sector managers to address their needs for an improved understanding of regional vulnerabilities to climate change and variability. Design/methodology/approach – The study used IA of climate change impacts through a complex adaptive systems approach incorporating social learning and stakeholder-led research processes. Workshops were conducted with stakeholders from NSW government agencies, state-owned corporations and local governments representing the tourism, water, primary industries, human settlements, emergency management, human health, infrastructure and natural landscapes sectors. Participants used regional socioeconomic profiling and climate projections to consider the impacts on and the need to adapt community service provision to future climate. Findings – Many sectors are currently experiencing difficulty coping with changes in regional demographics and structural adjustment in the economy. Climate change will result in further impacts on already vulnerable systems in the forms of resource conflicts between expanded human settlements, the infrastructure that supports them and the environment (particularly for water); increased energy costs; and declining agricultural production and food security. Originality/value – This paper describes the application of meta-analysis in climate change policy research and frames climate change as a problem of environmental pollution and an issue of development and social equity. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Animal products are critical to the nutrition, food security, livelihoods and resilience of hundreds of millions of people throughout the world. Livestock accounts for 40% of worldwide income from agriculture. Demand for animal products is set to continue increasing in the next three decades, as is their market price. If not carefully managed, a worldwide increase in the production of animal-derived products would increase pressure on natural resources (particularly water and land), significantly raising levels of dangerous greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the risk of people contracting zoonotic diseases. These realities are informing governments as they encourage the managed intensification of livestock production. They seek to do this in ways that take account of poorer people's contributions to the growth of rural economies. They look for ways to link together work on agricultural productivity, efficient food systems; infrastructure development; access to energy, water and affordable health care; and the sustenance of environmental services (including the mitigation of any further stimuli for changes in the global climate). Managed intensification of livestock production would also require long-term application of a One Health approach with its focus on mitigating health risks at the interfaces between animals and humans in different ecosystems. It will stimulate the joint working of multiple interests in pursuit of a common goal - ending hunger and malnutrition. The authors would like to see the One Health approach being incorporated within all nations' animal, environmental and public health policies and into the educational agendas of medical and veterinary undergraduate students. It must also be incorporated into preparedness, contingency planning, desk-top exercises and on-site simulations to get ready for the next mega disaster - no matter how improbable it might seem.

AB  - Food sustainability and food security are increasingly in the spotlight and increasingly intertwined. According to some projections we will need to nearly double food production in the next 4 decades. This article argues that protein production and consumption are pivotal to sustainability, because anthropogenic contributions to the nitrogen cycle are 100-200% compared with a contribution of 1-2% to the carbon cycle by mineral fuel combustion, with biodiversity as the main casualty. Because 1 kg animal protein requires w6 kg plant protein, its largescale production by means of factory farming is a major driver of biodiversity loss, climate change, and freshwater depletion. Furthermore, intensive livestock production is associated with antibiotics resistance and increasing incidence of emerging diseases. Therefore, a "reversed" diet transition back to less animal protein could make a difference. Some European countries, such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, and The Netherlands, have published integrated policy reports addressing food security, sustainability, and health combined. The food industry is focusing on food safety and increasingly on sustainability. An important issue is consumer communication, because consumer "framing" is radically different from that of governmental and industrial policy makers. There is no "one size fits all." A huge range of differences exists between countries and between distinct groups of consumers within countries; getting consumers to change their diets in a more sustainable direction is likely to require much more than gentle nudging. National governments and the United Nations should assume their responsibilities and initiate a global strategy integrating sustainability, food security, nutrition, and equity. To date, the profit pillar of sustainability has taken precedence over planet and people. It is time to redress the balance. © 2014 American Society for Nutrition.

AB  - Rising demand for food, fiber, and biofuels drives expanding irrigation withdrawals from surface water and groundwater. Irrigation efficiency and water savings have become watchwords in response to climate-induced hydrological variability, increasing freshwater demand for other uses including ecosystem water needs, and low economic productivity of irrigation compared to most other uses. We identify three classes of unintended consequences, presented here as paradoxes. Ever-tighter cycling of water has been shown to increase resource use, an example of the efficiency paradox. In the absence of effective policy to constrain irrigated-area expansion using "saved water", efficiency can aggravate scarcity, deteriorate resource quality, and impair river basin resilience through loss of flexibility and redundancy. Water scarcity and salinity effects in the lower reaches of basins (symptomatic of the scale paradox) may partly be offset over the short-term through groundwater pumping or increasing surface water storage capacity. However, declining ecological flows and increasing salinity have important implications for riparian and estuarine ecosystems and for non-irrigation human uses of water including urban supply and energy generation, examples of the sectoral paradox. This paper briefly considers three regional contexts with broadly similar climatic and water-resource conditions - central Chile, southwestern US, and south-central Spain - where irrigation efficiency directly influences basin resilience. The comparison leads to more generic insights on water policy in relation to irrigation efficiency and emerging or overdue needs for environmental protection. © Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Constructed wetlands are widely developed in Taiwan to compensate the lost and degraded natural wetlands due to human impacts and simulate the natural wetlands to provide many different ecosystem services such as water purification, climate regulations, wildlife habitat, and human recreation. However, biological invasion has become a serious threat in constructed wetland ecosystems because of their relatively low habitat stability and complexity. Nowadays, exotic apple snails (Ampullariidae: Pomacea canaliculata) have invaded most of the constructed wetlands in Taiwan and caused serious problems to the ecosystem including lowering the wastewater purification efficiency by extensively feeding on the macrophytes, competing with the native gastropods, and causing visual impacts due to their over-dominance in the constructed wetland habitats. In this study, we hypothesized that apple snails had different food preference on different macrophyte species and produced different growth responses correspondingly. We conducted laboratory feeding experiment to study the growth responses of apple snails upon feeding on 3 common wetland macrophytes including Ipomoea aquatica, Acorus calamus, and Phragmites australis. Results from ANOVA and Tukey Test showed that I. aquatica supported the highest growth rate of snails in terms of shell length and biomass increment. Pomacea canaliculata demonstrated significantly lower feeding preference on A. calamus and P. australis. However, results from regression analysis indicated that snails feeding on A. calamus showed the lowest growth rates. We therefore suggested that A. calamus would have the potential importance in controlling the establishment of P. canaliculata to the constructed wetlands. Our future work will involve analysis of the chemical and physical properties of macrophyte leaves to assess the relationship between food quality and food preferences of the apple snails. Our results could therefore provide implications for macrophyte planting in constructed wetlands as biological control measure of the invasive snails based on the bottom-up biomanipulative approach instead of applying traditional methods such as using pesticides or labor-intensive physical removal. © 2014, Taiwan Agricultural Engineers Society.

AB  - The oceans play a vital role in the global carbon cycle, regulate climate and temperature, provide food security and support the livelihoods of billions of people around the globe, especially in coastal areas (where over half the global population resides) and in small island states, where some of the most vulnerable populations rely on marine resources. However, the provision of these life-sustaining services is at risk-climate change and ocean acidification are already affecting marine ecosystems and coastal populations, threatening the ability of the oceans to continue providing economic resources and environmental services on which we so critically depend. Citing evidence of these key points, this paper calls for improved governance, the use of ecosystem-based approaches in coastal and ocean management, and urgency in transition to a low-carbon economy. With enhanced governance frameworks and a reliance on science and best practices, we can improve food security, enhance ecosystem resilience, secure sustainable livelihoods, and provide man-made and, perhaps more importantly, natural protections to threats to human health and environmental security from rising seas, acidifying oceans, coastal hazards and extreme weather events. The oceans play a vital role in combating climate change impacts, which, as much current evidence shows, will be more extensive and disastrous than previously forecast by international experts. It is urgent that the international community concertedly and decisively act to protect this function, including with the improvement of climate change cost estimates and development of financing mechanisms. We must act to increase resilience of key ocean and coastal ecosystems that provide shoreline and infrastructure protection, water quality maintenance, food security, and livelihood support. In effect, we must act to protect our own security through "ocean security". © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Variations in climate in the Asia-Pacific region play a major role in the development of natural ecosystems and of human societies. Furthermore, human activities place additional stresses on natural and societal systems and climate change is now considered a significant factor in these increases. The book documents the climate of the region and interactions of the climate with both the environment and societies in the region. The book emphasizes the impacts of climate change as well as strategies to mitigate and adapt to those impacts. A number of aspects of climate in the region that capture interactions between climate and natural and human systems are considered and include climate variability and change, climate and urbanization, climate and security, climate and society, and climate and sustainability. The book draws on published results in the scientific literature and the analysis presented highlights key climate-related issues for Asia and the Pacific. Subsequent chapters of the book include important issues such as: Climate variability and change – large-scale climate systems, trends in mean climate, trends in extreme climate events across Asia and the Pacific, challenges and opportunities for modeling the climate, current projections for future climate under climate change; Society and urbanization – trends in urbanization, interactions between urban areas and climate, climate hazards and vulnerabilities for urban areas, climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies for urban areas; Food, water and energy security – meeting future needs for rice and wheat across Asia, food from fisheries, water security, and balancing energy demands with reduced GHG emissions; Governance and sustainability – institutional arrangements to address the impacts of climate change, prospects for remote communities under climate change, effects of climate change on human health, low carbon development pathways, and ecosystem services to enhance the adaptive capacity of communities. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - There are clear trends of increasing temperature in the Asia-Pacific region. There are observed trends in extreme climate events and evidence of changes in large-scale climate systems including the monsoon and the associated Hadley circulation. Modeling the climate of the region provides opportunities for improved understanding and prediction, but there remain challenges especially for mountainous terrain and small islands. Current projections for future climate indicate that existing stresses are likely to be exacerbated. Urbanization is expected to continue and better understanding of the interactions between climate and urban areas is essential. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of adaptation and mitigation both in urban areas and in small communities. Significant challenges exacerbated by climate variability and change need to be overcome so that future needs for rice and wheat can be met. Management strategies need to be implemented globally so that fisheries will be able to provide necessary food for the region. Local management strategies are also needed to ensure water security. Regional and international cooperation is providing initial support for integrated assessments that can investigate pathways towards low carbon development (LCD) across the region. Natural ecosystem services support substantial components of economies across the region and new strategies are being developed to enhance the resilience of natural ecosystems impacted by climate change. Natural ecosystems in Asia and the Pacific can contribute significantly to the mitigation of climate change. Communities, particularly poor and remote communities, are vulnerable to climate change and there is a need for capacity building in research, policy development and implementation to reduce these vulnerabilities. International cooperation exists in the development of mechanisms to promote systematic observations of geophysical variables. Further cooperation is needed to ensure that consistent high-quality socio-economic data are collected, archived and accessible. Continuous monitoring of the geophysical environment and associated socio-economic variables, and developing and analyzing indicators of climate interactions with natural ecosystems and human societies is needed to fully interpret and respond to the complex socio-economic interactions with the Earth’s climate. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Occupying less than 7 % of Earth's land surface, tropical rain forests harbor perhaps half of the species on Earth and are ecologically, economically, and culturally crucial for issues in global food security, climate change, biodiversity, and human health. Geographically located between the latitudes 10°N and 10°S of the equator, lowland tropical rain forest ecosystems share similar physical structure but vary in geology, species composition, and anthropogenic threats across the forests of Southeast Asia, Australia, Africa, and Central and South America. Mature tropical rain forests are stratified by multiple canopy and understory layers, and physiognomic properties include evergreen broadleaf tree species, a preponderance of species with large leaves to aid with sunlight capture in the light-limited understory, and leaf properties such as entire margins and drip tips that channel water efficiently from the leaf surface. Lianas are increasing in abundance and biomass in a number of tropical rain forests. The additive effects of an increase in liana biomass are correlated with a reduction in tropical forest carbon (C) storage, a value that is currently not considered in global vegetation models. Most rain forest tree species do not grow, flower, or fruit year-round. Peaks in leaf flushing, flowering, and fruiting coincide with the high irradiance and low water stress associated with the onset of the wet season. This synchrony is common and largely driven by resource availability, though biotic explanations for synchrony include selection to attract pollinators or seed dispersers and to avoid herbivory and seed predation. With few exceptions, species richness across the tree of life is highest in equatorial tropical regions and decreases towards the poles. Tropical rain forests harbor approximately two thirds of the estimated 350,000-500,000 extant flowering plant species on Earth, with high rates of endemism and large numbers of rare species. Numerous evolutionary and ecological hypotheses to explain the origin and maintenance of high biological diversity in tropical forests have garnered support and include biogeographic history, evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation and speciation, range size and distribution constraints, and ecological mechanisms promoting species coexistence. Continental drift, climate constraints, and long-distance dispersal are responsible for some of the similarities and differences in species across tropical regions. Familial similarity among forests in Amazonia and Southeast Asia can be as high as 50 %, while independent diversification and species radiation mean that much fewer genera (around 10 %) are shared. Gradients in climate, parent material and soil age, topography and landscape stability, and atmospheric deposition result in strong heterogeneity in soil nutrient availability from local to regional scales. Soil order, which is generally correlated with soil fertility as a strong predictor of aboveground net primary productivity in tropical forests. Tropical forests account for approximately 40 % of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP), store half of Earth's vegetative C stocks but less than 10 % of its soil C stocks. The relationships between rainfall, temperature, soil fertility, and NPP are complex and require more experimental manipulations to tease apart the interactions. Intact tropical forests are net C sinks, but the uptake of C (1.1 ± 0.3 Pg C year-1) in intact tropical forests is counteracted by the emissions from tropical biome conversion - a net C source to the atmosphere of 1.3 ± 0.2 Pg C year-1 that results in a tropical biome net C balance of approximately zero. Stronger El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effects are increasing the frequency and severity of droughts, fires, hurricanes and cyclones, and flooding events. Recovery of aboveground biomass, species composition, and forest structure all depend on the type and severity of disturbance and its effect on soil fertility. Greater use of remote sensing imagery from satellites, airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, and unmanned drones will allow accurate tracking of disturbance and C stocks as well as monitoring of phenology, foliar canopy chemistry, individual species identification, and biodiversity estimates from local to regional scales. The tropical biome is undergoing significant change. Understanding the drivers and impacts of these changes will require sustained advances across multiple disciplines. Ultimately as a society, we are left asking what is the capacity of our remaining and regrowing tropical rain forests to adapt to long-term anthropogenic and climate change and what can we do to moderate these effects while nourishing a healthy human population. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

AB  - Grasslands are one of Earth's major biomes and the native vegetation of up to 40 % of Earth's terrestrial surface. Grasslands occur on every continent except Antarctica, are ecologically and economically important, and provide critical ecosystem goods and services at local, regional, and global scales. Grasslands are surprisingly diverse and difficult to define. Although grasses and other grasslike plants are the dominant vegetation in all grasslands, grasslands also include a diverse assemblage of other plant life forms that contribute to their species richness and diversity. Many grasslands also support a diverse animal community, including some of the most species-rich grazing food webs on the planet. Grasslands allocate a large proportion of their biomass below ground, resulting in large root to shoot ratios. This pattern of biomass allocation coupled with slow decomposition and weathering rates leads to significant accumulations of soil organic matter and often highly fertile soils. Climate, fire, and grazing are three important drivers that affect the composition, structure, and functioning of grasslands. In addition to the independent effects of these factors, there are many interactions among grazing, fire, and climate that affect ecological patterns and processes in grasslands in ways that may differ from the independent effects of each driver alone. Grasslands occur under a broad range of climatic conditions, though water is generally limiting for some part of the year in most grasslands. Many grasslands experience periodic droughts and a dormant season based on seasonal dry or cold conditions. Grasslands are sensitive to climate variability and climate changes. There are well-documented shifts in the distribution of North American grasslands in response to past droughts, and both observational data and experiments suggest that grasslands will be affected by future changes in rainfall and temperature. Fire is a common occurrence, particularly in more mesic grasslands, due to the large accumulations of dry, highly combustible fine fuel in the form of dead plant material. Fire affects virtually all ecological processes in grasslands, from the physiology of individual plants to the landscape-level patterns, though the effects of fire vary with grassland productivity and the accumulation of detritus. All grasslands are grazed or have experienced grazing as a selective force at some point in their evolutionary history. The ecological effects of grazing vary with climate and plant productivity, and the associated evolutionary history of grazers in different grasslands. Grasslands have been heavily exploited by humans, and many temperate grasslands are now among the most threatened ecosystems globally. Widespread cultivation of grasslands was the major land-use change that impacted grasslands historically, while multiple global changes drivers (i.e., altered fire and grazing regimes, woody plant encroachment, elevated CO2, invasive species, fragmentation) contribute to the contemporary loss of grasslands. Grassland restoration aims to recover the diversity and ecosystem services that grasslands provide. While restored grasslands may attain productivity comparable to native grasslands and sequester carbon for extended periods, they typically support much less diversity than comparable native grasslands. Recovery of soil communities and properties is often very slow. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

AB  - Agricultural systems occupy approximately 24 % of Earth’s terrestrial surface. They have been ensuring a vital ecosystem service, since food production kept pace with population growth in the course of the twentieth century. Most of the past balance has been ensured through agricultural intensification. There currently is, however, an obvious mismatch between human population sizes (and thus food demand) and food production among regions of the world. Further, alarming signs indicate that maintaining a balance between the world’s population growth and its food supply in the coming decades will become a major challenge, especially in the context of global, including climate, change. Agricultural systems involve inflows and outflows, which determine their performances. Outflows include primary, desirable ones (e.g., crop yields) and secondary, often undesirable outflows (e.g., nutrient and pesticide losses to the environment). Inflows include non-substitutable ones, with essential roles for crop growth and plant metabolism (e.g., water, seeds, nutrients), while others are substitutable (e.g., labor, mechanization, pesticides). These inflows contribute to the growth-defining, growth-limiting, and growth-reducing factors, which determine three levels of plant production: potential, attainable, and actual. Three entry points to enhance the performances of agricultural systems are considered, through increasing (1) potential yields, (2) attainable yields, and (3) actual yields. The latter entry point, which involves improving crop health, has several advantages. One of them is that its likely impact is at least equivalent to increasing potential yields or attainable yields. Another critical advantage of increasing actual yields, especially through the improvement of crop health, is that it allows addressing not only the quantity of harvests but also their quality, thus fulfilling the goals of achieving both global food security and food safety. We propose that this conclusion applies to all levels of agricultural intensification, in particular intensive agricultural systems, (1) which are potentially more exposed to crop loss risks, (2) whose performances are particularly vulnerable to global change, and (3) which will continue to play a central role in global food security and safety. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.

AB  - In Earth's 45th millionth century, a looming and global crisis of fresh water scarcity is on our doorstep—a crisis that is accelerating through our unbridled development, burgeoning demand for food and energy, and the effects of climate change. Only 0.1% of the total global water volume of the 1.4 billion km3 is accessible fresh water, and we are already withdrawing one third of our accessible renewable water resource, much of which is needed to sustain our ecosystems and biodiversity. Using the lens of virtual water, I argue that the UK faces water security challenges of a scale unseen by most of its population due to its dependence on other nations, many of which are water stressed, for three quarters of its water. Estimates suggest that we would need to invest five times the current global rate in new water supplies if we are to meet the projected demand in 20 years time. With little chance of investment of such scale taking place, there is a compelling need for water professionals to emerge from their comfort zone. Engineers can play a pivotal role in addressing the water sustainability challenges, by engaging with politicians, decision makers, and those with influencing power. New models for integrated water management are needed to address complex multi-stakeholder demand patterns. While we can and should develop cost-efficient water technology, water professionals must grasp this moment to put themselves at the center of water science, technology, politics, environment, and economics.

AB  - Human activity is changing the global environment at an unprecedented rate while humanity faces a range of complex and interrelated challenges to local, regional and global development, human security and politics. Food security ranks high on the science, policy and development agendas. However, most research linking global change and food systems examines the impact of climate change on agricultural production, or the impact of agriculture on land use, pollution and biodiversity, overlooking interactions with other aspects of the food system - such as food processing, packaging, transportation and consumption and employment derived from these activities. This book demonstrates that new threats to food security which arise from environmental change require more than simply a focus on agricultural practices - what is needed is an integrated food system approach. The authors point out that the process of adapting food systems to global environmental change is not simply a search for technological solutions to increase agricultural yields. Tradeoffs across multiple scales among food system outcomes are a prevalent feature of globalized food systems. Within food systems, there are key underexplored areas that are both sensitive to environmental change and crucial to understanding its implications for food security and adaptation strategies. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.

AB  - The rise of ‘ecological consciousness’ from the late 1970s onwards has complicated the already hugely contentious field of development policy and studies by adding a reflectivist dynamic, which seems impossible to avoid (see, for example, Beck 1992, 2009; Beck et al. 1994). In this chapter, I want to trace broadly why environmental questions are today central to development debates, and what this means for political debates over the future of our contemporary civilizations. The chapter begins with an outline of the reflectivist challenge posed by ecological concerns, and provides a basic account of the contradictions this raises for development policy and analysis. This is followed by a discussion of some case examples, which help to highlight central problems in the environment/development debate. In the third part, I step sideways to take a look at some of the reasons why the debates take on the forms they have, and investigate the intellectual, practical and political conditions that sustain things in this way. The final part concludes by drawing out three broad ideas central to reconciling environmental and developmental concerns. Before proceeding, I want to put a few preliminaries in place, which will help to scope and evaluate the exposition below. In developing the observations and points that follow, I won’t be able provide any arguments regarding some rather large issues. For example, whether anthropogenic climate change is or is not ‘happening’ is one of the questions that has-rightly or wronglyoccupied most of the headline news on environmental concerns, and has underpinned much political work in multilateral forums. (Think, for instance, of the importance assigned to the allocation of, and trade in, emission permits; see United Nations 1998; HM Treasury 2006). Beneath such pre-eminent, global concerns, others occasionally gain public exposure, such as the problems of ‘food security’, the provision of drinking water, disease control, deforestation and desertification, the integrity of oceanic ecosystems, and waste management; all are intermittently prominent concerns in debates involving scientists, interest groups, governments, bureaucracies, businesses and laypersons. For the purpose of the discussion that follows, I want to move away from one aspect of these discourses that has been fairly pervasive, namely the tendency to treat the issues in question in terms of an either/or logic. On such a reading, for instance, either climate change is (significantly) down to the active transformation of ecological conditions through human activity, or it is a coincidental occurrence, contingent upon cosmic or geological cycles and their implications, but beyond (decisive) human influence. The general expectation is that either of these two positions will eventually be validated on the strength of evidence produced through scientific research. In the meantime, politics revolves around people throwing their lot behind either one of the two approaches, sometimes out of conviction, but more often than not out of selfinterested motives. Once the truth about climate change is established, the condition of uncertainty that feeds the political debates will be removed, and social and political organization be conducted in the light of the new scientfic consensus. This strikes me as unhelpful for the question of how environmental and developmental imperatives may or may not contradict one another, what to do about it, and how to construct an analysis for such purposes. While the question of human agency in climate change is eminently important, for example, for considering some really rather tough questions about justice, both intergenerational and intercultural, the effects of alterations in climatic conditions require responses, whether these particular justice dimensions can be explicated with the help of scientific consensus or not: some of the Pacific Islands, which are threatened by rising sea levels, for example, are home to populations for whom assistance will be essential, whatever the expediencies of the ‘blame’ question might be (COP15 2009). For the purpose of this chapter, I will then assume that the main challenges posed by the ecological question for thinking about development are social and political, rather than about scientific validation, and epistemological arguments over what sorts of criteria should count in the latter. Lest I be misunderstood in this move, this is not to suggest that the debates about the science of climate change and about the ethics of responsibility and guilt are not important and worthwhile; instead, I want to suggest that a rather large part of why environmental questions have the effect of complicating and altering the ‘development’ narrative retains its plausibility and importance irrespective of settling on the science of either climate change, or any of the other constellations alluded to above. As we will see below, the paradoxes posed by considering developmental and environmental imperatives next to one another occur in a variety of contexts with discernible impacts, and are therefore already a persistent part of what people have to negotiate in their day-to-day lives around the world (Bass et al. 2005). Having said this, I should also point out that a constitutive assumption I do make for the purpose of this chapter is that human societies in general do have the proven capacity to alter their natural environment in ways that are potentially, and frequently were, actually detrimental to their ‘interests’. Overexploitation of natural resources has been a frequent contributory cause for the collapse of civilizations, not to speak of smaller communities (indicatively, see Diamond 2006). Once we step inside human history for orienting our frame of reference, we will thus find ample reason for proceeding very carefully with claims regarding links between ‘know-how’ and technology, and ecological sustainability.1. © 2014 Routledge.

AB  - Rural people in Africa are reported to be particularly vulnerable to climatic variations due to widespread poverty, poor health and education, food insecurity, lack of technology and infrastructure and limited access to credit opportunities (Nangoma, 2007). Moreover, it is believed that their low adaptive capacity and high dependence on resources sensitive to climatic changes makes them even more vulnerable to climate change. Adaptive capacity refers to the potential or ability of a community to cope with, adapt to or recover from the effects of an exposure (Adger, 2003). Rural access to alternative livelihoods (such as indigenous fruit trees) and degradation of these livelihoods during climatic stresses touch upon the crosscutting themes in this book: environment, equity and livelihoods. Rural people at tropical forest margins rely on forest resources to cope with climate events, among which non-timber forest products (NTFPs) play an important role (Eriksen et al., 2005; Fisher et al., 2010). NTFPs are products of biological origin other than wood derived from forests, other wooded land and trees outside forests (FAO, 2010). They provide food, medicine, livestock fodder and materials for handicrafts and construction among other things and they contribute especially to the livelihoods of poor and disadvantaged people in developing countries by helping to ensure food security, maintaining nutritional balance, meeting medicinal needs and supplying a source of income (FAO, 1995; Shackleton et al., 2002; Marshall and Newton, 2003; Emanuel et al., 2005; Schumann et al., 2010). In particular, people with little formal education and those in poor health turn to NTFP harvesting and use during adverse climatic events (Fisher et al., 2010). Among the plant species providing important NTFPs are indigenous fruit trees (IFTs), which are fruit bearing trees that are locally available, generally ignored by the commercial sector and not well researched. IFTs contribute to the food security of the rural poor, especially in times of famine (Akinnifesi et al., 2008) providing an alternative source of nutrition (Muok et al., 2001) and cash income (Akinnifesi et al., 2006). IFTs often also provide important medicine to local people (Iranbakhsh et al., 2009; Buchmann et al., 2010; Fandohan et al., 2010). Many IFTs improve environmental conditions in the savannah by adding organic matter and nutrients through leaf-fall and by reducing soil temperatures and water loss due to evapotranspiration (e.g., Amundson et al., 1995). Several IFTs also act as an important source of food, water (during times of drought) and shelter for a wide range of animals (e.g. Fenner, 1980). Among the most important indigenous fruit trees in dryland West Africa are the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata), the tamarind tree (Tamarindus indica), the shea nut tree (Vitellaria paradoxa), the African locust bean (Parkia biglobosa), the ber or jujube (Zizyphus mauritiana), the marula tree (Sclerocarya birrea) and the fan palm (Borassus aethyopum) to cite just a few (Boffa, 1999). IFT species are likely to be more resilient to climate change if compared to most of the current crops, which are generally exotic to Africa; IFTs have not lost the genetic capacity to cope with changes as a result of many years of selection. Although IFTs are especially important during droughts and floods - which are predicted to become more common in dryland Africa (i.e. annual mean surface air temperatures are expected to increase 2-4°C by 2099 in West Africa) (Boko et al. in IPCC, 2014) - little is known about the impact of predicted changes in climate on these species’ ecology, phenology (the study of seasonal natural phenomena), fruit production and survival. For example, changes of bloom dates for apple (Malus domestica) and pear (Pyrus communis) cultivars related to climatic changes have been observed in South Africa (Grab and Craparo, 2011). Changes in climate and soil moisture have also been reported to affect the fruiting of several plants in West Africa (Seghieri et al., 2009). Although no studies have determined changes in baobab phenology related to climatic changes, predicted changes in climate are likely to have a negative effect on its distribution across the African continent (Cuni Sanchez et al., 2011). Moreover, one should consider that predicted changes in climate may also accelerate the loss of already declining populations of some of these species through land-use intensification and over-harvesting (e.g. Obiri et al., 2002; Gaoue and Ticktin, 2007; Djossa et al., 2008; Houehanou et al., 2011). In the context of climate change, the maintenance of IFTs is important not only for biodiversity conservation (e.g. the baobab tree is an iconic African tree, being the national tree of Senegal for example) but also for the rural poor, as IFTs provide multiple services and are accessible in times of famine. While some services could be replaced with other techniques (e.g. soil conservation and water conservation techniques related to IFT presence in farmers’ fields), other services are not easily substituted (e.g. IFT edible nutritious fruits are available to be harvested when staple crops fail). Although several studies (e.g. Fisher et al., 2010) have focused on the role of NTFPs and IFTs during climatic stresses (see part (a) in Figure 9.1), little attention has been paid to the broader picture, in which climatic stresses directly impact IFTs and humans, in turn affecting management of IFTs and impacting tree populations (see part (b) in Figure 9.1). Finally, a decreasing number of trees may further impact human management of IFTs for the worse. As long-term monitoring studies of most IFTs (e.g. on population structure, phenology) are not available, local communities are a good source for information not only on management techniques but also on observed changes in climate and impacts on IFTs. Indeed, local communities in rural Africa have been shown to possess valuable knowledge about their environment (e.g. ethnobotany, Assogbadjo et al., 2008; Fandohan et al., 2010, 2011) and vegetation changes (e.g. Wezel and Haigis, 2000). This chapter mainly focuses on the adaptive capacity building loop of the theoretical framework of this book (see Ch. 1, Figure 1.1). It addresses the current local state of the environment, equity and livelihood security, the gap between the existing management practices and opportunities to improve them and adaptive capacity building in rural communities in Benin, paying special attention to IFTs as important NTFPs providers. © 2015 Dominic Stucker and Elena Lopez-Gunn.

AB  - Ecological microcosm systems are used as tools for examining, understanding and manipulating ecosystems processes as well as for assessing human impact on coastal marine ecosystems. Multiple species experimental systems act as interlinks between the natural environment and single-membered algal laboratory cultures. Microcosms can form a relatively controllable system to study phytoplankton ecology, primary productivity, phytoplankton-bacteria associations, food webs, nutrient dynamics, water- sediment interactions and biogeochemical processes. They can also be used to understand environmental problems such as nutrient inputs, eutrophication, species invasions, harmful algal blooms (HAB) and climate change. In addition, subjects related to ecological aspects like hot springs, temporary ponds and hypersaline lagoons can be investigated using microcosms. However, the artificial boundaries of the containers, the isolation of the experimental systems from the natural environment and unsatisfactory simulation of the physical conditions have to be taken into account when objectives are set and experiments are designed. The duration of a microcosm experiment is limited to the time period characterized by the system's steady-state conditions. Nutrient enrichments have to be well balanced to keep the steady state conditions as long as possible. The size of the initial community (inoculum) plays an important role in the maturity and replication of the systems and therefore it has to be considered very carefully. Once the objective(s) in a microcosm experiment is set, the particular system has to be standardized so that results from different experimental runs can be compared. Knowledge of scaling effects and artifacts of enclosure are of fundamental importance for obtaining results that can be extrapolated from experimental systems to natural ecosystems. In the present chapter physical, chemical, biological and ecological factors are reviewed. Experimental limitations due to spatial and temporal factors are discussed and applications referring to nutrient dynamics, phytoplankton ecology, eutrophication, modeling and climate change are presented. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Horticultural products and services impact the health and well-being of urban populations. This is an extremely important group for horticultural scientists and researchers to serve: More than half of all people worldwide already live in urban areas, and more than two-thirds will do so by 2050. In this chapter we address the past, current, and future roles that horticultural science plays in the major issues of concern to public welfare: public health, environmental health, food security, and economic stability. Urban horticulture has important impacts on the health of the individual and the community, two concerns of public health. Documented individual health benefits include less depression and improved pregnancy outcomes from walking in or living near urban green spaces. Community gardens, parks, and other urban vegetation enhance community health by improving social interactions, such as family dynamics, and public safety, such as protection from crimes. Uses of plants to improve the urban environment include temperature modification, air pollution reduction, and water quality improvement. Impacts on biological diversity are mixed. Other negative impacts include the introduction of invasive species. Urban food security requires food in sufficient, nutritious, and affordable quantities. Providing this for all people is one of the greatest challenges for horticultural science. Potential solutions include increasing small-scale food production in urban areas by providing more community gardens or converting vacant lots. Horticulture contributes directly to urban economics through the production and sales of horticultural products by urban businesses. Indirect contributions from plants include higher property values and more productive employees. The increasing urbanization and aging of the human population is happening in conjunction with rising environmental destruction from global warming and climate change. Combining the traditional horticultural concern of feeding the world with an expanded understanding of the additional functions provided by horticultural products, the needs of urban people, and the opportunities to partner with professionals in other disciplines will be essential in the unpredictable future. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.

AB  - Human well-being is dependent upon renewable natural resources. Agricultural systems, for example, depend upon plant productivity, soil, the water cycle, the nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus nutrient cycles and a stable climate. Renewable natural resources can be subject to biological and physical thresholds beyond which irreversible changes in benefit provision may occur. These are difficult to define and many are likely to be identified only once crossed. An environmental limit is usually interpreted as the point or range of conditions beyond which there is a significant risk of thresholds being exceeded and unacceptable changes occurring. [1] Biodiversity loss, climate change and a range of other pressures are affecting renewable natural resources. If governments do not effectively monitor the use and degradation of natural resource systems in national account frameworks, the probability of costs arising from exploiting natural resources beyond environmental limits is not taken into account. Appropriate measurement methodologies need to be developed and validated to assess the capacity of natural resource systems to deliver benefits, such as relevant sets of indicators. Decisions at local and regional scales need to reflect the implications and trade-offs for natural resource systems inherent in policy choices to determine possible consequences for current and future wellbeing. Valuation of changes in the benefits provided by natural resource systems are being incorporated into existing Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) techniques used in policy impact assessment approaches. However, where there is a risk of thresholds being breached and potentially irreversible impacts occurring, additional policy safeguards to maintain natural resource systems within environmental limits are required. Managing ecosystems to maximise one particular benefit, such as food provision, can result in declines in other benefits. The evidence base is not yet sufficient to determine the most effective ways to maintain benefit provision within environmental limits, but a range of policy responses are seeking to optimise multiple benefit provision, including: • agri-environment schemes • generic measures to enhance biodiversity, which may increase the capacity of natural resource systems to adapt to environmental change • the use of ecological processes to increase overall natural system resilience to address problems such as flood risk management. The consequences of large scale and potentially irreversible changes in benefits from natural resource systems, such as marine fisheries, could affect ecological security to such an extent that it is rational to minimise the risks, even if there is uncertainty as to exactly where the limits lie. However, the policy response to environmental risks to human wellbeing is mediated by the public response to that risk, with public acceptance affecting whether policies responding to a risk are enacted. There are significant challenges to successfully communicating environmental risks to the public. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent and potential future increases in global temperatures are likely to be associated with impacts on the hydrologic cycle, including changes to precipitation and increases in extreme events such as droughts, (Sheffield and Wood 2008). The Mediterranean - including most Arab countries - is one of the regions that has experienced trends toward more intense and longer droughts (IPCC 2012). Droughts are the world's costliest natural disasters, causing an average $6-8 billion in global damages annually and collectively affecting more people than any other form of natural disaster (Wilhite 2000). Given the consequences and pervasiveness of drought, it is important to assess drought severity, but the precise quantification of drought is a difficult geophysical endeavor. Drought is extremely serious problem in the Arab region, and will be an increasingly serious threat for all Arab countries that already are suffering from increased conflicts, displacements and instability alongside growing fragility of ecosystem services, with trends of land degradation, soil depletion and reduced water security. The Arab region is under growing food insecurity facing increased drought at a time when 28% of its population is already under in poverty. The high sensitivity of vegetation and crops to climate forcing may result in rapid land use changes and high vulnerability to land degradation and water insecurity (Evans and Geerken, 2004). A key challenge for understanding and addressing these risks is to bring together the science of climate change and drought risks on one hand, and emerging resilience based development policy responses on the other. Through cooperation of the LAS on Drought & Drylands and UNDP, this paper explores this risk-resilience nexus with a view to enhancing abilities to prevent impacts of future drought cycles on human development trends in the Arab region. This framework is based firstly on drought indices such as SPEI for analyzing long-term drought trends and satellite data from the last fifteen years to reconstruct past agricultural droughts. By measuring monthly differences in productive capacity of vegetation and crop patterns, this allows a characterization of intensity, variability frequency and persistence of agricultural drought in any given area. With this information, it is possible to identify the exposure of areas of rain-fed agriculture, rangeland, forests, irrigated croplands, individuals and cattle to agricultural drought as well as the amount of drought-affected areas experiencing land degradation, and to further estimate expected annual average losses (Erian et al., 2012). This scientific analysis is then coupled with a resilience based framework to development policy to assess resulting social vulnerabilities and development responses that can reduce risks while building long-term resilience of development results. The focus is on policies and actions that prioritize prevention of future risk accumulation and the exacerbating factors to underlying social tensions and challenges in the Arab region.

AB  - Climate change represents a feedback-loop in which livestock production both contributes to the problem and suffers from the consequences. The impact of global warming and continued, uncontrolled release of greenhouse gasses (GHG) has twofold implications for the livestock industry, and consequently food security. Firstly, the continuous increase in ambient temperature is predicted to have a direct effect on the animal, as well as on food and nutrition security, due to changes associated with temperature itself, relative humidity, rainfall distribution in time and space, altered disease distribution, changes in the ecosystem and biome composition. Secondly, the responsibility of livestock production is to limit the release of greenhouse gases (GHG) or the carbon footprint, in order to ensure future sustainability. This can be done by implementing new or adapted climate-smart production systems, the use of known and new technologies to turn waste into assets, and by promoting sustainable human diets with low environmental impacts. The following elements, which are related to livestock production and climate change, are discussed in this paper: (1) restoring the value of grasslands/rangelands, (2) pastoral risk management and decision support systems, (3) improved production efficiency, (4) global warming and sustainable livestock production, (5) the disentanglement between food and nutritional needs, focusing on nutrient rich core foods, (6) GHG from livestock and carbon sequestration, and (7) water and waste management. No single organization (or industry) within South Africa can perform this research and the implementation thereof on its own. The establishment of a (virtual) centre of excellence in climate-smart livestock production and the environment for the livestock industries, with the objective to share research expertise and information, build capacity and conduct research and development studies, should be a priority.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) provide some important goods and services, thus making them an important contributor to social well-being. They are widely regarded as the cornerstones of biodiversity conservation strategies worlwide, providing the main foundation for in situ conservation of flora and fauna, being an important element of any sustainable development. The double impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss are major threats to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, especially those relating to environmental sustainability, poverty alleviation and food and water security. Protected undeveloped areas are an important tool for land conservation in developing nations. Efficient land allocation decisions and resource management requires knowledge of non-market benefits. The contingent valuation method is a stated preference method of non-market valuation where respondents are asked to state their preferences for an environmental good or service that is not bought and sold in traditional markets. This study used contingent valuation method (CVM) to derive estimates of economic value for recreational benefits use of Albanian part of Prespa Park (AL-Prespa), in southeastern Albania. The contingent valuation survey used a dichotomous choice (DC) format followed by an openended question asking for their maximum WTP for restoration. Park visitors were surveyed regarding their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for ecological restoration and recreational benefits of area. The WTP responses were analysed using a probit procedure. The results of the study indicated that visitors are willing to pay increased entrance fees to finance ecological restoration and recreational benefits of areas damaged by human activities. Consumer surplus for ecological restoration and recreational benefits of the AL-Prespa elicited through the close-ended DC exercise was found to be € 1.4 per person, and elicited through the open-ended exercise was found to be about € 1.6. The factors and personal characteristics of the visitors that affect respondent’s WTP for ecological restoration and recreational benefits damaged by human activities in AL-Prespa could be important inputs in order to ensure successful environment protection. The results of this study also should be helpful to assist the authority for the fee system and how much they can increase the new entrance fee charged to the visitors. © 2014 World Food Ltd. and WFL Publishers.

AB  - Wheat is the third largest crop globally and an essential source of calories in human diets. Maintaining and increasing global wheat production is therefore strongly linked to food security. A large geographic variation in wheat yields across similar climates points to sizeable yield gaps in many nations, and indicates a regionally variable flexibility to increase wheat production. Wheat is particularly sensitive to a changing climate thus limiting management opportunities to enable (sustainable) intensification with potentially significant implications for future wheat production. We present a comprehensive global evaluation of future wheat yields and production under distinct Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agro-ecosystem model. We project, in a geographically explicit manner, future wheat production pathways for rainfed and irrigated wheat systems. We explore agricultural management flexibility by quantifying the development of wheat yield potentials under current, rainfed, exploitable (given current irrigation infrastructure), and irrigated intensification levels. Globally, because of climate change, wheat production under conventional management (around the year 2000) would decrease across all RCPs by 37 to 52 and 54 to 103. Mt in the 2050s and 2090s, respectively. However, the exploitable and potential production gap will stay above 350 and 580. Mt, respectively, for all RCPs and time horizons, indicating that negative impacts of climate change can globally be offset by adequate intensification using currently existing irrigation infrastructure and nutrient additions. Future world wheat production on cropland already under cultivation can be increased by ~. 35% through intensified fertilization and ~. 50% through increased fertilization and extended irrigation, if sufficient water would be available. Significant potential can still be exploited, especially in rainfed wheat systems in Russia, Eastern Europe and North America. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change and degradation of ecosystem services functioning may threaten the ability of current agricultural systems to keep up with demand for adequate and inexpensive food and for clean water, waste disposal and other broader ecosystem services. Human health is likely to be affected by changes occurring across multiple geographic and time scales. Impacts range from increasing transmissibility and the range of vectorborne diseases, such as malaria and yellow fever, to undermining nutrition through deleterious impacts on food production and concomitant increases in food prices. This paper uses case studies to describe methods that make use of satellite remote sensing and Demographic and Health Survey data to better understand individual-level human health and nutrition outcomes. By bringing these diverse datasets together, the connection between environmental change and human health outcomes can be described through new research and analysis. © 2014 The Author(s).

AB  - Recent assessment reports suggest that climate change patterns are threatening social and ecological vulnerability and resilience, with the strong potential of negatively affecting human health. Persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have weakened physiological responses and are immunologically vulnerable to pathogens and stressors in their environment, putting them at a health disadvantage in climate-based rising temperatures, water scarcity, air pollution, potential water- and vector-borne disease outbreaks, and habitat redistributions. These climatic aberrations may lead to increased surface drying and decreased availability of arable land, threatening food/nutrition security and sanitary water practices. Coupled with HIV/AIDS, climate change threatens ecological biodiversity via a larger-scale socioeconomic recourse to natural resources. Corresponding human and environmental activity shape conditions conducive to exacerbating high rates of HIV/AIDS. In South Africa, this epidemic is forming a 'syndemic' with tuberculosis (TB), which has come to include multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) strains. Because of high convergence rates, one epidemic cannot be addressed without understanding the other. Concurrent climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies are becoming increasingly important to curb changes that negatively affect the biospheres on which civilisation is ultimately dependent - from an agricultural, a developmental, and especially a health standpoint. Mitigation strategies such as reducing carbon emissions are essential, but may be only partially effective in slowing the rate of surface warming. However, global climate assessments assert that these are not sufficient to halt climate change patterns. The roles of regionally specific climate research, socioecologically sustainable industrialisation paths for developing countries, and adoption of health system strengthening strategies are therefore vital.

AB  - The impact of climate change on human health and well-being has already been observed. Direct effects such as those related to heat, cold, floods, storms and solar ultraviolet radiation have been documented. Some vector-, food- and water-borne diseases and other infectious diseases influenced by ecosystems are likely to increase in incidence. Respiratory health is affected by near-surface ozone exposures, episodes of acute air pollution, and aero-allergens. Indirect health impacts also exist. For example, changes in agricultural production, and loss of crop yield and the nutritional value of food have detrimental effects on nutrition. Increasing ambient temperatures can lead to loss of work capacity and occupational health concerns. The impact on mental health, mass migration, conflict and violence associated with changes in climate should not be underestimated.

AB  - Earth's climate has experienced notable changes during the past 50-70 years when global surface temperature has risen by 0.8°C during the 20th century. This was a consequence of the rise in the concentration of biogenic gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and ozone) in the atmosphere that contribute, along with water vapor, to the so-called 'greenhouse effect'. Most of the emissions of greenhouse gases have been, and still are, the product of human activities, namely, the excessive use of fossil energy, deforestations in the humid tropics with associated poor land use-management, and wide-scale degradation of soils under crop cultivation and animal/pasture ecosystems. General Circulation Models predict that atmospheric CO2 concentration will probably reach 700 μmol(CO2) mol-1. This can result in rise of Earth's temperature from 1.5 to over 5°C by the end of this century. This may instigate 0.60-1.0 m rise in sea level, with impacts on coastal lowlands across continents. Crop modeling predicts significant changes in agricultural ecosystems. The mid- and high-latitude regions might reap the benefits of warming and CO2 fertilization effects via increasing total production and yield of C3 plants coupled with greater water-use efficiencies. The tropical/subtropical regions will probably suffer the worst impacts of global climate changes. These impacts include wide-scale socioeconomic changes, such as degradation and losses of natural resources, low agricultural production, and lower crop yields, increased risks of hunger, and above all waves of human migration and dislocation. Due to inherent cassava tolerance to heat, water stress, and poor soils, this crop is highly adaptable to warming climate. Such a trait should enhance its role in food security in the tropics and subtropics. © 2014 The Institute of Experimental Botany.

AB  - Artificial radionuclides (ARN - 90Sr-T1/2=28.6 years, 137Cs-T1/2=30.1 years) and heavy metals (HM - Fe, Mn, Ni, Mo, Pb, V, Ti, Cu, Cr) can penetrate into the human organism through the water-soil-plant chain and cause different diseases. The Armenian nuclear power plant (ANPP) is in a densely populated area of the Ararat Valley with intensive agriculture. ANPP uses the water of the River Metsamor. The waters that come out of the ANPP fall into the Metsamor River which is used for crop irrigation. Since 1996 we have carried out radiomonitoring researches in water-soil-plant ecosystems in zones of the ANPP within a radius of 2-15 km. The aim of our studies is to develop practical radio protective strategies to achieve ecologically pure food production. Our investigation has shown that the content of 90Sr fluctuated between 3.7-8.8 Bq/kg and 137Cs between 5.7-13.1 Bq/kg in spices crops (basil, celery, dill, parsley, lettuce). The 90Sr content fluctuated between 1.0-7.2 Bq/kg and 137Cs between 3.5-7.5 Bq/kg in the other crops (pepper, tomato, eggplant, vegetable marrow, string beans, cucumber, potato, cauliflower, onion). HM contents in spicy crops fluctuated widely (416.7-1513.9 mg/kg; in other crops 125.2-744.3 mg/kg). This is likely due to the joint influence of factors vegetation period, mineral nutrition, rooting patterns, watering regime, anatomical structure and size of leaves. We can conclude that ARN and HM penetrated into crops through irrigation water (artesian, Metsamor River, Akna Lake), from the soil as well as the atmosphere (dust, smoke and aerosol). Frequent watering of spicy herbs promoted ARN and HM migration from irrigation water and soils in the hot and dry soil-climate conditions of the Ararat Valley. It is important to note that ARN content did not exceed the MACL in planting material, while the HM (Fe, Ni, Cr, Pb) exceed edit.

AB  - Poyang Lake has been an important wintering site for Common Cranes. In this paper we monitored the dynamics of population size and spatial distribution of Common Cranes wintering in Poyang Lake during 1998-2011 and analyzed the potential determinants of its population dynamics. This was combined with the monitoring record of the annual maximum number of Common Cranes wintering in the Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve during 1984-2011. We illustrated the changing trend of this Common Crane population over a long time scale, and analyzed the impact of climate variation and water level change on the population size dynamics. The results showed that the Common Crane population wintering in Poyang Lake significantly increased from 1998 to 2011, with an average population size of 2335±651 and a maximum of 7640 in the winter of 2011. The exponential curve fit well with the population growth trend (R2 = 0.808, F = 46.234, df = 12, P = 0.000). The wintering Common Cranes clustered in the Poyang lakes, with the lakes of Dahuchi, Dalianzihu, Sanhu, Hanchihu, Qihu, Zhuhu, Nanhu (gongqing), and Dachahu being the hotspots used by them. On average, (74.9±5.6)% of Common Cranes wintered outside nature reserves. The spatial distribution of the common crane was significantly positively correlated with the areas of mudflat habitat, and was negatively correlated with areas of agricultural land, human density, village areas, and areas of net primary productivity (NPP) in August and November. The mudflat area was an important factor determining the spatial distribution of Common Cranes, which accounted for 15% of the spatial change in occurrence frequency, and when combined with the NPP factor in November, accounted for 24.6% of the spatial change in the average number of Common Cranes. The results mean that there are still factors which may affect the spatial distribution of Common Crane in Poyang lakes which were not assessed, such as competition, the structure of the microhabitat, and human interference, which maybe contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the impact mechanisms of crane population dynamics wintering in the Poyang Lake. In the Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve, the average annual maximum number of Common Cranes was 276±51 (n =28), which showed a significant linear increase (R2 =0.176, F =5.537, df =27, P =0.026), but there was a drastic annual fluctuation. The results of Pearson correlation analysis indicated that the annual maximum population number of Common Cranes wintering in the Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve was significantly positively correlated with the average air temperature in October (r =0.480, P =0.010, n =28) and the average minimum air temperature in October (r = 0.480, P =0.010, n =28), and significantly negatively correlated with the average maximum wind speed in October (r = -0.450, P =0.016, n =28). As for the water level of Poyang Lake, no significant correlation was found between the annual maximum population size of Common Cranes in the Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve and the annual minimum water level (r =-0.259, P = 0.192, n = 27), or the annual maximum water level (r = -0.373, P = 0.051, n = 28). There was also no significant correlation between the population size and the monthly average water level in the wintering period. Although the water level of Poyang Lake in winter was tested and found to significantly change the structural landscape of Poyang Lake wetland, influencing the availability of habitat and food, the water level of those lakes in the nature reserve was largely determined by the artificial aquaculture discharge time and velocity of the lake, which eliminated the influence of water level in Poyang Lake.

AB  - Climate change is rapidly degrading the conditions of crop production. For instance, increasing salinization and aridity is forecasted to increase in most parts of the world. As a consequence, new stress-tolerant species and genotypes must be identified and used for future agriculture. Stress-tolerant species exist but are actually underutilized and neglected. Many stress-tolerant species are indeed traditional crops that are only cultivated by farmers at a local scale. Those species have a high biodiversity value. Besides, the human population will probably reach nine billion within coming decades. To keep pace with population growth, food production must increase dramatically despite the limited availability of cultivable land and water. Here, we review the benefits of quinoa, Chenopodium quinoa Willd., a seed crop that has endured the harsh bioclimatic conditions of the Andes since ancient times. Although the crop is still mainly produced in Bolivia and Peru, agronomic trials and cultivation are spreading to many other countries. Quinoa maintains productivity on rather poor soils and under conditions of water shortage and high salinity. Moreover, quinoa seeds are an exceptionally nutritious food source, owing to their high protein content with all essential amino acids, lack of gluten, and high content of several minerals, e.g., Ca, Mg, Fe, and health-promoting compounds such as flavonoids. Quinoa has a vast genetic diversity resulting from its fragmented and localized production over the centuries in the Andean region, from Ecuador to southern Chile, and from sea level to the altiplano. Quinoa can be adapted to diverse agroecological conditions worldwide. Year 2013 has therefore been declared the International Year of Quinoa by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Here, we review the main characteristics of quinoa, its origin and genetic diversity, its exceptional tolerance to drought and salinity, its nutritional properties, the reasons why this crop can offer several ecosystem services, and the role of Andean farmers in preserving its agrobiodiversity. Finally, we propose a schematic model integrating the fundamental factors that should determine the future utilization of quinoa, in terms of food security, biodiversity conservation, and cultural identity. © 2013 INRA and Springer-Verlag France.

AB  - Global climate change has become an urgent issue of concern. Climate change will increasingly threaten our food production, security and even the survival of the human race. It also has a serious impact on natural ecosystems and the socioeconomic system. With the increasing scale and improvement in mechanization levels, the economic linkage between agricultural production and reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions is even closer in the agricultural production system. Therefore, the development of a low-carbon agricultural model is one of the long-term strategies for low-carbon economic growth throughout the country. This research of carbon footprint is introduced to measure the GHG emission over the rice production cycle. The carbon footprint can be defined as the total carbon emissions caused by an organization, event, product or person. At present, carbon footprints are used to measure GHG emissions in products, services, organizations, cities and countries and offer the decision basis for the formulation of GHG emission reduction schemes. Agricultural ecological systems, every year, also produce a lot of GHG emissions. The whole process of prenatal, intrapartum and postpartum agricultural production are closely related to energy consumption and GHG emission. In the process, all the agricultural inputs, such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, cultivation, plant protection, agricultural machinery, irrigation and harvest also produce greenhouse gas emissions. The whole cultivation of rice involves methane (CH4) emission. This study shows that rice cultivation is one of the biggest sources of GHG emissions in crop cultivation. Rice paddies emit a large amount of methane in their water logged mode. Different irrigation modes have a great influence on the emission of GHG. Straw return is another factor that promotes GHG emissions. Soil organic content increases with the return of straw, with an increase in the soil methanogen activity, leading to increased methane emissions. The current carbon footprint research is the first time it has been used to measure the carbon emissions involved in rice production. The carbon footprint for rice production in Shanghai was assessed by the PAS2050 paradigm and life cycle assessment. The study area, located in Changjiang Farm, which belongs to the Guangming Group in Chongming County Shanghai City atlatitude 121°32′22″E, longitude31°40′23″N. Chongming County, in the Yangtze River Estuary, is a typical sub tropical monsoon climate with mild climate, abundant rainfall, annual average temperatures of 15.3 °C, and annual precipitation of 1245 mm. It is the major grain production base for Shanghai city with winter wheat and summer rice forming their main planting patterns, which are typical for the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River rice-wheat rotation cropping pattern. The entire carbon emission of rice production in Shanghai was 11.8114 t CO2e (CO2-equivalents) /hm2, corresponding to a 1.2321 t CO2 e/t rice grain yield. GHG emissions from paddy fields were the major source, which emitted 0.9507 t CO2e/t rice and accounted for 77.1% of total carbon emissions during rice production. Moreover, CH4 was the largest source for GHG emissions with a contribution rate of 96.6%.Chemical fertilizers were the second largest emission source in rice production. Chemical fertilizers emitted 0.2044 t CO2e for each ton of rice production, contributing 16.5% of total carbon emissions in rice production. N fertilizer was the biggest emission source, which released 0.1159 t CO2e/t rice. This research investigates the GHG emissions over the whole process of the Shanghai rice production cycle and reveals the energy consumption and GHG emissions in rice production. Thus, a rice carbon footprint is calculated by assessing the GHG emissions in Shanghai rice production. The results are beneficial for producing reduction plans of reducing GHG emissions in Shanghai rice production. Furthermore, the results will supply both practicable and theoretical foundations for drafting carbon footprint formulations in other industrial areas.

AB  - The human population is expected to reach ~9 billion by 2050. The ensuing demands for water, food and energy would intensify land-use conflicts and exacerbate environmental impacts. Therefore we urgently need to reconcile our growing consumptive needs with environmental protection. Here, we explore the potential of a land-use optimisation strategy to increase global agricultural production on two major groups of crops: cereals and oilseeds. We implemented a spatially-explicit computer simulation model across 173 countries based on the following algorithm: on any cropland, always produce the most productive crop given all other crops currently being produced locally and the site-specific biophysical, economic and technological constraints to production. Globally, this strategy resulted in net increases in annual production of cereal and oilseed crops from 1.9 billion to 2.9 billion tons (46%), and from 427 million to 481 million tons (13%), respectively, without any change in total land area harvested for cereals or oilseeds. This thought experiment demonstrates that, in theory, more optimal use of existing farmlands could help meet future crop demands. In practice there might be cultural, social and institutional barriers that limit the full realisation of this theoretical potential. Nevertheless, these constraints have to be weighed against the consequences of not producing enough food, particularly in regions already facing food shortages. © 2013 Koh et al.

AB  - The global food security situation and outlook remains delicately imbalanced amid surplus food production and the prevalence of hunger, due to the complex interplay of social, economic, and ecological factors that mediate food security outcomes at various human and institutional scales. A growing population and rising incomes with the resultant nutritional transition of millions more people entering into the middle class are some of the unprecedented challenges that mankind has never handled before. Food production outpaced food demand over the past 50 years due to expansion in crop area and irrigation, as well as supportive policy and institutional interventions that led to the fast and sustained growth in agricultural productivity and improved food security in many parts of the world. However, future predictions point to a slow-down in agricultural productivity and a food-gap mainly in areas across Africa and Asia which are having ongoing food security issues. The problem of food insecurity is expected to worsen due to, among others, rapid population growth and other emerging challenges such as climatechange and rising demand for biofuels. Climate change poses complex challenges in terms of increased variability and risk for food producers and the energy and water sectors. The major existing and emerging challenges to global food security are discussed in this chapter, giving relevant examples from around the world. Strategic research priorities are outlined for a range of sectors that underpin global food security, including: agriculture, ecosystem services from agriculture, climate change, international trade, water management solutions, the water-energy-food security nexus, service delivery to smallholders and women farmers, and better governance models and regional priority setting. There is a need to look beyond agriculture and invest in affordable and suitable farm technologies if the problem of food insecurity is to be addressed in a sustainable manner. This requires both revisiting the current approach of agricultural intervention and reorienting the existing agricultural research institutions and policy framework. Proactive interventions and policies for tackling food security are discussed which include issues such as agriculture for development, ecosystem services from agriculture, and gender mainstreaming, to extend the focus on food security within and beyond the agriculture sector, by incorporating cross-cutting issues such as energy security, resource reuse and recovery, social protection programs, and involving civil society in food policy making processes by promoting food sovereignty. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Human activity is rapidly transforming most of Earth's natural systems. How this transformation is impacting human health, whose health is at greatest risk, and the magnitude of the associated disease burden are relatively new subjects within the field of environmental health. We discuss what is known about the human health implications of changes in the structure and function of natural systems and propose that these changes are affecting human health in a variety of important ways.We identify several gaps and limitations in the research that has been done to date and propose a more systematic and comprehensive approach to applied research in this field. Such efforts could lead to a more robust understanding of the human health impacts of accelerating environmental change and inform decision making in the land-use planning, environmental conservation, and public health policy realms.

AB  - The diverse hydro-climate between northern and southern China causes serious complications related to increasing food demand, declining water availability, and increasing flood risk in Changjiang and Yellow River basins. The huge projects of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) for diminishing flood and South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP) for driving water from Changjiang to Yellow and Hai Rivers to compensate for an imbalance of environmental resources will not necessarily solve all of the problems that they were originally intended to address. A sophisticated eco-hydrological model is required to evaluate the optimum amount of transferred water associated with these projects, together with socio-economic and environmental consequences. For this purpose, the process-based National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model was modified to couple with complex sub-systems in irrigation, stream junction, reservoir operation, and water transfer, to develop coupled human and natural systems and evaluate cause and effect of uneven water resources. The model clarified the impact of irrigation on eco-hydrological processes and predicted hydrologic change after TGD and SNWTP to estimate whether dilemmas between water stress, crop productivity, and ecosystem degradation would diminish. The result also showed the missing role of surface water - groundwater interactions and lateral subsurface flow, usually not considered important by assuming stationarity in previous researches of continental scales. A heterogeneous pattern of Time-Integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index gradient in agricultural fields helped to estimate uneven crop yield and its relation to water availability. This integrated approach will have some roles not only to re-consider this complex process from the view point of hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles, but also to clarify how the substantial pressures of complicated problems can be overcome by effective trans-boundary solutions. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Understanding the competing pressures on water resources requires a detailed knowledge of the future water balance under uncertain environmental change. The need for a robust, scientifically rigorous evidence base for effective policy planning and practice has never been greater. Environmental change includes, but is not limited to, climate change; it also includes land-use and land-cover change, including deforestation for agriculture, and occurs alongside changes in anthropogenic interventions that are used in natural resource management such as the regulation of river flows using dams, which can have impacts that frequently exceed those arising in the natural system. In this paper, we examine the role that land surface models can play in providing a robust scientific basis for making resource management decisions against a background of environmental change.We provide some perspectives on recent developments in modelling in land surface hydrology. Among the range of current land surface and hydrology models, there is a large range of variability, which indicates that the specification and parametrization of several basic processes in the models can be improved. Key areas that require improvement in order to address hydrological applications include (i) the representation of groundwater in models, particularly at the scales relevant to land surfacemodelling, (ii) the representation of human interventions such as dams and irrigation in the hydrological system, (iii) the quantification and communication of uncertainty, and (iv) improved understanding of the impact on water resources availability of multiple use through treatment, recycling and return flows (and the balance of consumptive and conservative uses). Through a series of examples, we demonstrate that changes in water use could have important reciprocal impacts on climate over a wide area. The effects of water management decisions on climate feedbacks are only beginning to be investigated- they are still only rarely included in climate impact assessments-and the links between the hydrological system and climate are rarely acknowledged in studies of ecosystem services. Nevertheless, because water is essential not only for its direct uses but also for the indirect functions that it serves (including food production, fisheries and industry), it is vital that these connected systems are studied. Building on the examples above, we highlight recent research showing that assessment of these trade-offs is particularly complex in wetland areas, especially in situations where these trade-offs play to the advantage of different communities. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Human-induced (anthropogenic) climate change, rising CO2 concentrations, and global warming are adversely affecting ecosystem functions and thus ecosystem services. Ecosystems have capacities to function as sinks for CO2 and regulate water flows in landscapes. There is growing concern over the impact of the imminent climate changes in the Anthropocene era on biodiversity and food/feed security. Biodiversity loss and poverty are two of the world's major challenges in the twenty-first century. By 2025, two-thirds of the world's population could be living under water-critical conditions. Arid regions (drylands) cover about 45-47% of the Earth's land surface, the largest biome on the planet, and are home for 38% of the total global population. Arid lands are prone to the dangers of climate change and are the most likely to be seriously hit. Plants use solar energy to power the conversion of CO2 into biomass. There is need for new paradigms in plant research and technology for the utilization of plants as biomass resources. Aloe, a genus of the family Xanthorrhoeaceae comprising of about 548 species, is a plant group that provides useful products and can also be used for ecosystem restoration. Medicinal use of Aloe leaves dates back thousands of years, and today Aloe plants are world-renowned as a source of natural products derived from the leaf exudates and mesophyll. Aloe exhibit remarkable morphological variability and range in size from dwarf species only a few centimeters tall to tree Aloe reaching heights of up to 20m. Aloe form a striking and important component of many arid and semi-arid landscapes. Aloe are associated with dry habitats and hot climates. About 10 species of Aloe are used as sources of herbal medicines and less than 10 can be eaten safely. Aloe vera and Aloe ferox are key commercial medicinal species. A. ferox and Aloe secundiflora are wild-harvested in the Africas. More than 40 species of Aloe are in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (2011) Red List of Threatened Species. The trade of all Aloe, except A. vera, is regulated by CITES. In this chapter, we review the biology and biotechnology of A. vera, with a special emphasis on clonal propagation. Major research has been performed all over the world on the conservation and clonal propagation of A. vera and Aloe polyphylla. At Jodhpur (Gateway of the Thar Desert), India, we have developed a method for rapid clonal propagation by shoot proliferation from axillary meristem(s) of selected germplasm (edible) of A. vera. The bud explants produced multiple shoots on Murashige and Skoog (MS) media+3.0mgl-1 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and additives. The shoots were further multiplied by repeated transfer to fresh nutrient medium and subculturing on MS+lower concentration of BAP. The maximum number of shoots was produced on MS medium+1.0mgl-1BAP and additives. The rate of shoot multiplication increased and the vigor of the shoots improved if the shoots were cultured in liquid MS medium with 1.0mgl-1BAP. The cloned shoots rooted in vitro on hormone-free half-strength MS salts+activated charcoal at 30-34°C. The cloned shoots were excised and isolated individually, the base of each shoot dipped in solution of 500mgl-1 of either indole-3-butyric acid or β-naphthoxyacetic acid for 5 min, and then rooted ex vitro on soilrite in glass bottles in the greenhouse. The plantlets were acclimatized and hardened in the greenhouse. These were stored under an agro-net-covered nursery. The cloned plants were transferred under different field conditions at various locations in Rajasthan, India, during different seasons. The method described here is highly reproducible and easier for mass cloning of A. vera due to the high rate of shoot multiplication achieved on low-cost culture medium and also the ease with which shoots are rooted ex vitro, facilitating quicker hardening/acclimation and field transfer. © 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Australia exports more than half its agricultural production by volume, and participates in addressing global food insecurity through food aid and technical assistance on agricultural production for developing nations. However, some Australians are food insecure and poor nutrition is responsible for about 16 % of the total disease burden and implicated in more that 56 % of all deaths in Australia. The two overall and closely linked concerns in Australia are food security and food sovereignty; improving the diet of Australians and maintaining its own capacity to produce and deliver healthy diets. These concerns are not easily resolved because of the dependence of the food system on high demand resources such as fossil fuels, fertilizers, water and productive land and the need to maintain profit in the system. There is also a growing appreciation that Australian agriculture is likely to be profoundly affected by climate change and the political response to climate change. Four reasons for taking immediate action on these concerns are suggested. There are moral (human rights to food) and economic (having a productive workforce) reasons and two practical reasons; as a rich country Australia has the ability to experiment to find better arrangements within the social-ecological system, and trends in the external drivers such as population growth, resource costs, and biodiversity decline indicate that these concerns will grow. These four reasons suggest there will never be a better time to try new arrangements to get improved outcomes for Australians and the environment that supports them. New arrangements in the social-ecological system need to address three major issues; people's access to food and equity, about how food is produced and traded, and how the land use planning processes could protect the long-term viability of food production, particularly around major Australian cities. The chapter concludes with a summary of each chapter in the book. The chapters are grouped into three sections that address the major issues in food security and sovereignty in Australia; (1) food equity and access, (2) food production and trade, and (3) land use planning. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

AB  - Soil degradation is a critical and growing global problem. As the world population increases, pressure on soil also increases and the natural capital of soil faces continuing decline. International policy makers have recognized this and a range of initiatives to address it have emerged over recent years. However, a gap remains between what the science tells us about soil and its role in underpinning ecological and human sustainable development, and existing policy instruments for sustainable development. Functioning soil is necessary for ecosystem service delivery, climate change abatement, food and fiber production and fresh water storage. Yet key policy instruments and initiatives for sustainable development have under-recognized the role of soil in addressing major challenges including food and water security, biodiversity loss, climate change and energy sustainability. Soil science has not been sufficiently translated to policy for sustainable development. Two underlying reasons for this are explored and the new concept of soil security is proposed to bridge the science-policy divide. Soil security is explored as a conceptual framework that could be used as the basis for a soil policy framework with soil carbon as an exemplar indicator. © 2013 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Productivity-diversity theory has proven informative to many investigations seeking to underst and drivers of spatial patterns in biotic communities and relationships between resource availability and community structure documented for a wide variety of taxa. For soil bacteria, availability of organic matter is one such resource known to influence diversity and community structure. Here we describe the influence of environmental gradients on soil bacterial communities of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, a model ecosystem that hosts simple, microbially-dominated foodwebs believed to be primarily structured by abiotic drivers such as water, organic matter, pH, and electrical conductivity. We sampled 48 locations exhibiting orders of magnitude ranges in primary production and soil geochemistry (pH and electrical conductivity) over local and regional scales. Our findings show that environmental gradients imposed by cryptogam productivity and regional variation in geochemistry influence the diversity and structure of soil bacterial communities. Responses of soil bacterial richness to carbon content illustrate a productivity-diversity relationship, while bacterial community structure primarily responds to soil pH and electrical conductivity. This diversity response to resource availability and a community structure response to environmental severity suggests a need for careful consideration of how microbial communities and associated functions may respond to shifting environmental conditions resulting from human activity and climate variability. © 2013 Geyer et al.

AB  - This paper argues that the interplay of water, carbon and vegetation dynamics fundamentally links some global trends in the current and conceivable future Anthropocene, such as cropland expansion, freshwater use, and climate change and its impacts. Based on a review of recent literature including geographically explicit simulation studies with the process-based LPJmL global biosphere model, it demonstrates that the connectivity of water and vegetation dynamics is vital for water security, food security and (terrestrial) ecosystem dynamics alike. The water limitation of net primary production of both natural and agricultural plants - already pronounced in many regions - is shown to increase in many places under projected climate change, though this development is partially offset by water-saving direct CO2 effects. Natural vegetation can to some degree adapt dynamically to higher water limitation, but agricultural crops usually require some form of active management to overcome it - among them irrigation, soil conservation and eventually shifts of cropland to areas that are less water-limited due to more favourable climatic conditions. While crucial to secure food production for a growing world population, such human interventions in water-vegetation systems have, as also shown, repercussions on the water cycle. Indeed, land use changes are shown to be the second-most important influence on the terrestrial water balance in recent times. Furthermore, climate change (warming and precipitation changes) will in many regions increase irrigation demand and decrease water availability, impeding rainfed and irrigated food production (if not CO2 effects counterbalance this impact - which is unlikely at least in poorly managed systems). Drawing from these exemplary investigations, some research perspectives on how to further improve our knowledge of human-water-vegetation interactions in the Anthropocene are outlined. © Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Synopsis: The Philippines is a country made up of islands, some large and some small. It is an agricultural country with mostly steeply sloping land that was cleared of forest to become cropland - principally for food crops to support the rapidly increasing population. Over time, soil loss and nutrient depletion have reduced the productivity of the land. Innovative approaches that provide soil protection and improve both livelihoods and human nutrition have been trialled. This chapter summarizes the results of some of them. Key Points The Philippines, one of the largest island-groups in the world with 7,107 islands and islets, is strategically located within the area of nations that sweeps southeast from Mainland Asia across the equator to Australia. Approximately 27.3 % of the Philippines is vulnerable to drought, alternating with yearly floods and typhoons, causing serious land degradation and declining land productivity. These are provinces located in Type 1 climate, which are typhoon and drought prone and are generally vulnerable to El Nino - 6.60 million hectares are in Luzon, 1.41 million hectares (Mha) in the Visayas. There are specific provinces in Mindanao that are likewise becoming vulnerable to seasonal dryness caused by natural drought and El Nino phenomenon. It is estimated that soil erosion carries away a volume of soil 1 m deep over 200,000 ha a year. On-site soil fertility losses in the Philippines due to unsustainable land management, as per 1989 World Bank estimates, is to be around US$ 100 M, equal to one per cent of Philippine GDP per year. The quality and management of land resources in the Philippines has become of serious concern because of exponentially increasing population and the need to expand agricultural production to marginal areas while ironically converting prime agricultural lands to non-agricultural uses. Acknowledging the Philippines' increasing vulnerability to drought and land degradation as a result of increasing recurrence of dry spell and alternating incidence of El Nino and La Nina as well as poor management of land, freshwater, and watershed resources, the Philippine National Action Plan (NAP) was formulated and implemented by the Philippine Government in 2004. The NAP is an expression of full and unqualified commitment of the Philippine Government in the effective and accelerated implementation of the programs and project activities to combat desertification, land degradation and poverty in the identified drought vulnerable areas of the country. It is a working document for the convergence of actions of the Departments of Agriculture (DA), Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Science and Technology (DOST) and Agrarian Reform (DAR). The NAP is water-centered and focused on the sustainable management of Critical Watershed Areas located in seasonally dry/arid areas, which are suffering from food insecurity. It is composed of two major thematic programs - Sustainable Agriculture and Marginal Upland Development and Integrated Ecosystem Management. These thematic programs have five components - Land and Water Technology Development, Local Governance and Community Initiatives, Data Base Development and Harmonization, Information, Education and Communication, and Enabling Policy Development. All of these aim to mainstream agriculture and rural development programs that will prevent the incidence and spread of desertification in deprived communities living in seasonally arid degraded lands. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Synopsis: This chapter presents an overview of the current status of desertification in Chad and outlines the measures being taken to arrest and reverse land degradation, revegetate bare land and raise household incomes. The outcomes of several successful projects are summarized. Key Points Like most states of the African Sahel, Chad has suffered from the encroachment of the desert. Traditional herding practices and the need for firewood and wood for construction have exacerbated the problem. Lake Chad was one of the largest fresh bodies of water on the African continent and its disappearance will have a tremendous impact on the population surrounding it. The problem of Lake Chad is increasingly complex because of the international nature of the desertification. Lake Chad is a regional problem East African and North African member states of the African Union and UN must deal with it. A collaborative approach to combating the desertification of Lake Chad is needed to reverse the current trends. Land and terrestrial resources in Africa have unparalleled economic, social and environmental value. Traditionally, African societies are agrarian or pastoral, depending directly on subsistence farming to meet their daily needs. Commercial agriculture holds an equally important position, employing the largest share of the workforce in most countries, and contributing significantly to national economic growth, export earnings and foreign exchange. However, national and household dependency on agricultural output has been a significant factor in limited economic growth over the past three decades. Climatic instability has caused significant and frequent variability in production, and narrow crop diversity, and national and international market failures, have facilitated recurrent economic losses. Desertification, land degradation and drought have negative impact on the availability, quantity and quality of water resources that result in water scarcity. As desertification takes its toll, water crises are expected to continue raising ethnic and political tensions in drylands, contributing to conflicts where water resources straddle or delineate country borders. Water scarcity is the long-term imbalance between available water resources and demands. Increasing occurrences of water scarcity, whether natural or human-induced, serve to trigger and exacerbate the effects of desertification through direct long-term impacts on land and soil quality, soil structure, organic matter content and ultimately on soil moisture levels. The direct physical effects of land degradation include the drying up of freshwater resources, an increased frequency of drought and sand and dust storms, and a greater occurrence of flooding due to inadequate drainage or poor irrigation practices. Should this trend continue, it would bring about a sharp decline in soil nutrients, accelerating the loss of vegetation cover. This leads in turn to further land and water loss from pollution of surface and groundwater, siltation, salinization, and alkalization of soils. Poor and unsustainable land management techniques also worsen the situation. Over cultivation, overgrazing and deforestation put great strain on water resources by reducing fertile topsoil and vegetation cover, and lead to greater dependence on irrigated cropping. Observed effects include reduced flow in rivers that feed large lakes such as Lake Chad, leading to the alarmingly fast retreat of the shorelines of these natural reservoirs in Chad. With climate change, the situation is likely to get worse - less water and creeping desertification in the semi-arid terrain. Declining productivity and soil structure in the Sahelian zones of Chad is exacerbated by unpredictable rainfall and drought, resulting in extreme degradation and desertification. Chad is currently experiencing the greatest vulnerability to desertification, with 58 % of the area already classified as desert, and 30 % classified as highly or extremely vulnerable. Rapid population growth and policy pressures to increase production have forced the cultivation of greater and greater areas of land in all sub-regions, and the extension of cultivation and grazing to marginal areas. Combined with limited application of organic or inorganic fertilizers, reductions in fallow periods, restrictions on crop diversity, inappropriate irrigation, and an increasing use of herbicides and pesticides, this has resulted in the physical, chemical and biological degradation of vegetation and soil. Soil erosion and desertification rates are increasing as a result, and declines in productivity have been noted. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. All rights reserved.

AB  - The role of water security in sustainable development and in the nexus of water, food, energy and climate interactions is examined from the starting point of the definition of water security offered by Grey and Sadoff. Much about the notion of security has to do with the presumption of scarcity in the resources required to meet human needs. The treatment of scarcity in mainstream economics is in turn examined, therefore, in relation to how each of us as individuals reconciles means with ends, a procedure at the core of the idea of sustainable development. According to the Grey-Sadoff definition, attaining water security amounts to achieving basic, single-sector water development as a precursor of more general, self-sustaining, multi-sectoral development. This is consistent with the way in which water is treated as "first among equals", i.e. privileged, in thinking about what is key in achieving security around the nexus of water, food, energy and climate. Cities, of course, are locations where demands for these multiple resource-energy flows are increasingly being generated. The paper discusses two important facets of security, i.e., diversity of access to resources and services (such as sanitation) and resilience in the behavior of coupled human-built-natural systems. Eight quasi-operational principles, by which to gauge nexus security with respect to city buildings and infrastructure, are developed. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Sustainable development in Africa is dependent on increasing use of the continent's water resources without significantly degrading ecosystem services that are also fundamental to human wellbeing. This is particularly challenging in Africa because of high spatial and temporal variability in the availability of water resources and limited amounts of total water availability across expansive semi-arid portions of the continent. The challenge is compounded by ambitious targets for increased water use and a rush of international funding to finance development activities. Balancing development with environmental sustainability requires (i) understanding the boundary conditions imposed by the continent's climate and hydrology today and into the future, (ii) estimating the magnitude and spatial distribution of water use needed to meet development goals, and (iii) understanding the environmental water requirements of affected ecosystems, their current status and potential consequences of increased water use. This article reviews recent advancements in each of these topics and highlights innovative approaches and tools available to support sustainable development. While much remains to be learned, scientific understanding and technology should not be viewed as impediments to sustainable development on the continent. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Deforestation is responsible for a substantial fraction of global carbon emissions and changes in surface energy budgets that affect climate. Deforestation losses include wildlife and human habitat, and myriad forest products on which rural and urban societies depend for food, fiber, fuel, fresh water, medicine, and recreation. Ecosystem services gained in the transition from forests to pasture and croplands, however, are often ignored in assessments of the impact of land cover change. The role of converted lands in tropical areas in terms of carbon uptake and storage is largely unknown. Pastures represent the fastest-growing form of converted land use in the tropics, even in some areas of rapid urban expansion. Tree biomass stored in these areas spans a broad range, depending on tree cover. Trees in pasture increase carbon storage, provide shade for cattle, and increase productivity of forage material. As a result, increasing fractional tree cover can provide benefits land managers as well as important ecosystem services such as reducing conversion pressure on forests adjacent to pastures. This study presents an estimation of fractional tree cover in pasture in a dynamic region on the verge of large-scale land use change. An appropriate sampling interval is established for similar studies, one that balances the need for independent samples of sufficient number to characterize a pasture in terms of fractional tree cover. This information represents a useful policy tool for government organizations and NGOs interested in encouraging ecosystem services on converted lands. Using high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery, fractional tree cover in pasture is quantified for the municipality of Rio Branco, Brazil. A semivariogram and devolving spatial resolution are employed to determine the coarsest sampling interval that may be used, minimizing effects of spatial autocorrelation. The coarsest sampling interval that minimizes spatial dependence was about 22 m. The area-weighted fractional tree cover for the study area was 1.85 %, corrected for a slight bias associated with the coarser sampling resolution. The pastures sampled for fractional tree cover were divided between 'high' and 'low' tree cover, which may be the result of intentional incorporation of arboreal species in pasture. Further research involving those ranchers that have a higher fractional tree cover may indicate ways to promote the practice on a broader scale in the region. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - Cities are characterized by dynamic interactions between socio-economic and biophysical forces. Currently more than half of the global population reside in cities which influence the global biogeochemical cycles and climate change, substantially exacerbating pressures on urban pollution, water quality and food security, as well as operating costs for infrastructure development. Goods and services such as aesthetic values, water purification, nutrient recycling, and biological diversity, that urban ecosystems generate for the society, are critical to sustain. Urban planners are increasingly facing the considerable challenges of management issues for urban ecosystems. Poor understanding of the complementary roles of urban ecology in urban infrastructure, and the functioning of ecosystems and ecological resilience of a complex human-dominated landscape has impeded effective urban planning over time, resulting in social disharmony. Here a complementary framework for urban ecology is proposed, in which ecosystems interact with land use, architecture and urban design - "E-LAUD" - affecting ecosystem and human health, and building on the concept that land uses in urban green areas, road-strips, wetlands, 'habitat islands' and urban architecture could synergistically benefit when clustered together in different combinations of urban landscapes. It is proposed that incorporation of the E-LAUD framework in urban planning forms the context of a new interdisciplinary research programme on ecological resilience for urban ecosystems and helps promote ecosystem services. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Increasing world human population, declining reserves of cheaply extracted fossil fuels, scarcity of supplies of fresh water and climatic instability will put tremendous pressure on world rangelands as the 21st century progresses. It is expected that the human population of the world will increase by 40% by 2050 but fossil fuel and reserves of fresh water will be drastically reduced. Avoiding food shortages and famine could be a major world challenge within the next 10 years. Under these conditions, major changes in policies relating to economic growth and use of natural resources seem essential. Stabilisation of the human population, development of clean and renewable energy, enhanced supplies of water and its quality, increased livestock production, and changed land-use policies, that minimise agricultural land losses to development and fragmentation, will all be needed to avoid declining living conditions at the global level. The health and productivity of rangelands will need to receive much more emphasis as they are a primary source of vital ecosystem services and products essential to human life. Changes in tax policies by developed, affluent countries, such as the United States, Australia and Canada, are needed that emphasise saving and conservation as opposed to excessive material consumption and land development. Extreme levels of debt and chronic deficits in trade by the United States and European Union countries need to be moderated to avoid a devastating collision of debt, depletion of natural resources, and environmental degradation. Over the next 10 years, livestock producers of the rangelands will benefit from a major increase in demand and prices for meat. Rapidly increasing demand for meat in China and other Asian countries is driving this trend. Rangeland managers, however, will also likely encounter greater climatic, financial, biological and political risks. Higher interest rates, higher production costs and higher annual variability in forage resources are major challenges that will confront rangeland managers in the years ahead. Under these conditions, a low risk approach to livestock production from rangelands is recommended that involves conservative stocking, use of highly adapted livestock, and application of behavioural knowledge of livestock to efficiently use forage resources.

AB  - The demand for more food is increasing fertilizer and land use, and the demand for more energy is increasing fossil fuel combustion, leading to enhanced losses of reactive nitrogen (Nr) to the environment. Many thresholds for human and ecosystem health have been exceeded owing to Nr pollution, including those for drinking water (nitrates), air quality (smog, particulate matter, ground-level ozone), freshwater eutrophication, biodiversity loss, stratospheric ozone depletion, climate change and coastal ecosystems (dead zones). Each of these environmental effects can be magnified by the 'nitrogen cascade': a single atom of Nr can trigger a cascade of negative environmental impacts in sequence. Here, we provide an overview of the impact of Nr on the environment and human health, including an assessment of the magnitude of different environmental problems, and the relative importance of Nr as a contributor to each problem. In some cases, Nr loss to the environment is the key driver of effects (e.g. terrestrial and coastal eutrophication, nitrous oxide emissions), whereas in some other situations nitrogen represents a key contributor exacerbating a wider problem (e.g. freshwater pollution, biodiversity loss). In this way, the central role of nitrogen can remain hidden, even though it actually underpins many trans-boundary pollution problems. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - As climate change alters environmental conditions, the incidence and global patterns of human diseases are changing. These modifications to disease profiles and the effects upon human pharmaceutical usage are discussed. Climate-related environmental changes are associated with a rise in the incidence of chronic diseases already prevalent in the Northern Hemisphere, for example, cardiovascular disease and mental illness, leading to greater use of associated heavily used Western medications. Sufferers of respiratory diseases may exhibit exacerbated symptoms due to altered environmental conditions (e.g., pollen). Respiratory, water-borne, and food-borne toxicants and infections, including those that are vector borne, may become more common in Western countries, central and eastern Asia, and across North America. As new disease threats emerge, substantially higher pharmaceutical use appears inevitable, especially of pharmaceuticals not commonly employed at present (e.g., antiprotozoals). The use of medications for the treatment of general symptoms (e.g., analgesics) will also rise. These developments need to be viewed in the context of other major environmental changes (e.g., industrial chemical pollution, biodiversity loss, reduced water and food security) as well as marked shifts in human demographics, including aging of the population. To identify, prevent, mitigate, and adapt to potential threats, one needs to be aware of the major factors underlying changes in the use of pharmaceuticals and their subsequent release, deliberately or unintentionally, into the environment. This review explores the likely consequences of climate change upon the use of medical pharmaceuticals in the Northern Hemisphere. © Clare H. Redshaw, Will M. Stahl-Timmins, Lora E.

AB  - Wheat is fundamental to human civilization and has played an outstanding role in feeding a hungry world and improving global food security. The crop contributes about 20 % of the total dietary calories and proteins worldwide. Food demand in the developing regions is growing by 1 % annually and varies from 170 kg in Central Asia to 27 kg in East and South Africa. The developing regions (including China and Central Asia) account for roughly 53 % of the total harvested area and 50 % of the production. Unprecedented productivity growth from the Green Revolution (GR) since the 1960s dramatically transformed world wheat production, benefitting both producers and consumers through low production costs and low food prices. Modern wheat varieties were adopted more rapidly than any other technological innovation in the history of agriculture, recently reaching about 90 % of the area in developing regions. One of the key challenges today is to replace these varieties with new ones for better sustainability. While the GR "spared" essential ecosystems from conversion to agriculture, it also generated its own environmental problems. Also productivity increase is now slow or static. Achieving the productivity gains needed to ensure food security will therefore require more than a repeat performance of the GR of the past. Future demand will need to be achieved through sustainable intensification that combines better crop resistance to diseases and pests, adaptation to warmer climates, and reduced use of water, fertilizer, labor and fuel. Meeting these challenges will require concerted efforts in research and innovation to develop and deploy viable solutions. Substantive investment will be required to realize sustainable productivity growth through better technologies and policy and institutional innovations that facilitate farmer adoption and adaptation. The enduring lessons from the GR and the recent efforts for sustainable intensification of cereal systems in South Asia and other regions provide useful insights for the future. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - Some of the characteristics of the African Great Lakes are the numerous species of fish, crustaceans, mollusks, plankton, and other phyla, most of them endemic. The usual sources of perturbation when speaking about Great Lakes also have their impacts on the African Great Lakes, such as overfishing, dumping of untreated sewage, pebble and sand mining, agricultural run-off and other threats. Should this biodiversity be protected in times of sheer poverty of the riparian populations? Should it be exposed to exploitation for food security? What are the values of these endemic species in economic terms? This article reviews the impacts on biodiversity by human-induced factors like exotic fish introductions and the invasive water hyacinth, but also by indirect factors like climate change. Lake Victoria has a long history of fish introductions and invasive weeds, but on Lake Tanganyika the original species composition of many taxa can still be preserved and protected, at a cost. The Great Lakes surrounding these countries, by means of conventions and regional management bodies, sought to protect the environments and called for international collaboration to improve management of the natural resources, both terrestrial and aquatic. The way forward will be to involve local fishing communities in nature conservation and management, but there are many communities and many fishermen. How to reach them in areas where there is no municipal electricity supply, no portable phone network, nor internet facilities. In the 21st century, around the African Great Lakes the keyword is survival, not only of biodiversity, but also of the inhabitants of their basins. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Soil organic carbon is one of the main parameters for soil fertility. Soils with high organic carbon contents can store more nutrients and water and influence their availability positively. Additional, a better soil structure protects the soil for losses of nutrients and pollutions into the groundwater. Therefore, organic carbon is essential for soil productivity and food security. The soil organic carbon pool is a main constituent of the global carbon pools and influences main processes of the climate and environment. Soils can serve as source or sink for carbon depending mainly on the way of use. Soil organic carbon stocks are highly vulnerable to human activities. In response to land use change from natural ecosystems to agriculture and unsustainable management contents soil organic carbon decrease significantly and rapidly. Especially, mechanisms for stabilizing organic carbon in soils are affected. Different strategies are required for maintaining or even increasing organic carbon in soils. Reverting agricultural soils in near-natural perennial systems are most promising. But in near future, economic incentives and political will are necessary to realize these strategies. This is the only way to stop losses of soil carbon, to maintain the productivity of soils and to mitigate the challenges of climate change.

AB  - As the world's largest distributed store of fresh water, ground water plays a central part in sustaining ecosystems and enabling human adaptation to climate variability and change. The strategic importance of ground water for global water and food security will probably intensify under climate change as more frequent and intense climate extremes (droughts and floods) increase variability in precipitation, soil moisture and surface water. Here we critically review recent research assessing the impacts of climate on ground water through natural and human-induced processes as well as through groundwater-driven feedbacks on the climate system. Furthermore, we examine the possible opportunities and challenges of using and sustaining groundwater resources in climate adaptation strategies, and highlight the lack of groundwater observations, which, at present, limits our understanding of the dynamic relationship between ground water and climate. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - This paper offers a new classification of environmental shocks from a dynamical systems perspective, and reviews early warning systems for environmental shocks, particularly in climate systems and ecosystems. Three main categories of environmental shock are identified; extreme events, abrupt swings, and tipping points. The factors determining the predictability of different shocks and hence the prospects for early warning are outlined. Lessons from existing early warning systems for extreme events and abrupt climate swings are summarised. Then the potential for early warning of bifurcation-type tipping points is explained, and contrasted with the lack of warning when stochastic internal variability triggers a shift in the state of a system. The scientific and technological progress needed to improve early warning capability is outlined. Then the framework is applied to the Foresight project on Migration and Global Environmental Change, with its focal eco-regions of drylands, low-elevation coastal zones, and mountainous regions. Priority targets for early warning systems are identified and the need for an integrated approach to early warning is highlighted, which considers the interactions between different types of environmental shock. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wetland plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance. Water regimes are the most important driving forces for wetland structure and function. Unfortunately, in recent decades, impacts of anthropogenic activities (e.g. dam construction, agricultural irrigation, industry, settlements) compounded with climate change have altered natural flow regimes profoundly and led to severe degradation of wetlands worldwide. Baiyangdian Wetland, the largest freshwater lake wetland in North China, has dried up on several occasions due to increasing human activities since the 1960s. To alleviate the ecosystem degradation trends, flow regulation was introduced to recharge the drying wetland on 19 occasions from 1997 to 2009. However, the impacts of these actions on ecosystem structure and function remain poorly understood. In this study the Ecopath software was employed to establish two mass-balance ecosystem models before and after the flow regulation in September 2009. The changes in trophic composition, flow processes, and other ecosystem indices were compared. The results show that following the flow regulation process the biomass in the first trophic level increased, while a decrease was recorded for the higher trophic levels. Furthermore, total primary productivity /total respiration (TPP/R) increased by 12.07%, while the system omnivorous index (SOI), Finn's cycling index (FCI), and average path length (APL) decreased by 4.16, 20.13, and 23.40%, respectively. Overall, the shift in indices indicates that ecosystem process during flow regulation was contrary to natural wetland succession. The weakened interactions among organisms in different trophic level will result in degrading ecosystem maturity. Hence flow regulation in September 2009 increased the vulnerability of Baiyangdian Wetland to external disturbance. This study indicates that ecosystem trophic interactions should be modelled before flow regulation to prevent ecosystem degradation and key ecosystem indices should be monitored and regulated toward natural ecosystems during and after flow regulation. © 2013 ISEIS All rights reserved.

AB  - This article reviews the level of current scientific understanding regarding the impact of future change in the large-scale climate-earth system on ecosystem services. Impacts from sea level rise, ocean acidification, increases in ocean temperature, potential collapse of the thermohaline circulation; failure of the South Asia monsoon; the melting of sea ice, the Greenland Ice Sheet and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet; changes in water availability; and Amazonia forest dieback, are considered. The review highlights that while a number of uncertainties remain in understanding, there is evidence to suggest that climate change may have already affected some ecosystem services. Furthermore, there is considerable evidence to show that future climate change could have impacts on biodiversity, as well as secondary impacts on issues important to human society, including; habitability; land productivity and food security; water security; and potential economic impacts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - It is well known that food has a considerable environmental impact. Less attention has been given to mapping and analysing the emergence of policy responses. This paper contributes to that process. It summarises emerging policy development on nutrition and sustainability, and explores difficulties in their integration. The paper describes some policy thinking at national, European and international levels of governance. It points to the existence of particular policy hotspots such as meat and dairy, sustainable diets and waste. Understanding the environmental impact of food systems challenges nutrition science to draw upon traditions of thinking which have recently been fragmented. These perspectives (life sciences, social and environmental) are all required if policy engagement and clarification is to occur. Sustainability issues offer opportunities for nutrition science and scientists to play a more central role in the policy analysis of future food systems. The task of revising current nutrition policy advice to become sustainable diet advice needs to begin at national and international levels. Copyright © 2012 The Author.

AB  - The global food system makes a significant contribution to climate changing greenhouse gas emissions with all stages in the supply chain, from agricultural production through processing, distribution, retailing, home food preparation and waste, playing a part. It also gives rise to other major environmental impacts, including biodiversity loss and water extraction and pollution. Policy makers are increasingly aware of the need to address these concerns, but at the same time they are faced with a growing burden of food security and nutrition-related problems, and tasked with ensuring that there is enough food to meet the needs of a growing global population. In short, more people need to be fed better, with less environmental impact. How might this be achieved? Broadly, three main 'takes' or perspectives, on the issues and their interactions, appear to be emerging. Depending on one's view point, the problem can be conceptualised as a production challenge, in which case there is a need to change how food is produced by improving the unit efficiency of food production; a consumption challenge, which requires changes to the dietary drivers that determine food production; or a socio-economic challenge, which requires changes in how the food system is governed. This paper considers these perspectives in turn, their implications for nutrition and climate change, and their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, an argument is made for a reorientation of policy thinking which uses the insights provided by all three perspectives, rather than, as is the situation today, privileging one over the other.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges we face in the twenty-first century is to sustainably feed nine to ten billion people by 2050 while at the same time reducing environmental impact (e.g. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, biodiversity loss, land use change and loss of ecosystem services). To this end, food security must be delivered. According to the United Nations definition, 'food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life'. At the same time as delivering food security, we must also reduce the environmental impact of food production. Future climate change will make an impact upon food production. On the other hand, agriculture contributes up to about 30% of the anthropogenic GHG emissions that drive climate change. The aim of this review is to outline some of the likely impacts of climate change on agriculture, the mitigation measures available within agriculture to reduce GHG emissions and outlines the very significant challenge of feeding nine to ten billion people sustainably under a future climate, with reduced emissions of GHG. Each challenge is in itself enormous, requiring solutions that co-deliver on all aspects. We conclude that the status quo is not an option, and tinkering with the current production systems is unlikely to deliver the food and ecosystems services we need in the future; radical changes in production and consumption are likely to be required over the coming decades.

AB  - Improved natural resource management in the densely settled highlands of eastern Africa must begin at the farm level, as this is the basic decision unit and the locus of key inputs (land, labor, capital) which have a defining role in agricultural production systems. It is also here where concrete livelihood improvements can be made most directly, thus enhancing the likelihood that farmers will invest in natural resource management (at farm and landscape scale) with slower returns, or wider landscape governance initiatives (covered in Chapter 4) with more diffuse or uncertain returns. Throughout the centuries, farmers have on their own initiative devised, developed, adopted, and adapted ingenious strategies and technologies for ensuring food security and economic welfare for their households (O’Neil, 1995). Farmer innovations such as the plough and the domestication of plants and animals that revolutionized agriculture date back more than 10, 000 years. Farmer innovation is a process through which individuals or groups discover or develop new and better ways of managing available resources to suit their particular conditions. The resulting innovations or outcomes of the innovation process may be technical or socio-institutional (Waters-Bayer and Bayer, 2009). Innovation also occurs within a wider socio-economic and institutional context which conditions the extent and directionality of innovation processes, including the interaction among individuals or groups, policies and norms, and institutional and societal cultures. Innovative farmers are those who have tried or are trying out new, often value-adding agricultural or NRM practices, using their own knowledge and wisdom while also appropriating outsiders’ knowledge (Assefa and Fenta, 2006). For instance, improving crop varieties through careful selection of seed, harvesting rainwater from roads, and implementation soil and water conservation measures, among others, are often carried out in the absence of any outside facilitation or support. Traditional irrigation systems (e.g., of the Chagga and Sonjo in Tanzania and Qantas in Iran), local knowledge on weather forecasting, biological control technologies, production of new pesticide concoctions, use of different plants and roots for soil fertility improvement, and local cures for different animal and human ailments are some of the well-documented farmer innovations (Lyamchai et al., 2006). These innovations have clearly played a significant role in the improvement of rural livelihoods and will continue to do so in the future. Yet while local knowledge is essential to household food security, income generation and risk management vis-à-vis market fluctuations and an uncertain climate, formal research can play an instrumental role in supporting farmer innovation. This is either because certain techniques are beyond farmers’ reach, as in the case of complex crop and livestock breeding technologies, or because researchers have access to a wider range of information and technologies that can assist farmers in capturing new opportunities or coping with a fast pace of change. As stated by O’Neil (1995: 1): Farmers are the ultimate integrators of the information they receive to increase production, stabilize yields, use pesticides, etc. It is the farmer that “lives the problem, " gains the benefits and suffers the consequences. Therefore, a combination of farmers’ and scientific knowledge will increase the rate of success and identify new areas of effort that neither group alone would have discovered. © 2012 World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and International Development Research Centre.

AB  - The relationship between people and the natural world is, to say the least, complex. On the one hand, people depend for their very existence on a healthy natural support system. Nature provides us with a suite of goods and services which enable human survival. These include provisioning of food, water and materials, climate and water regulation, nutrient cycling, pollination, primary production, and aesthetic, spiritual and recreational benefits, amongst many others (De Groot et al. 2002). The value of these ecosystem services is indisputable, even if difficult to quantify, and contributes to fundamental constituents of human well-being, including security, basic material needed for a ‘good’ life, health, and good social relations (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Indeed in the overall balance of nature, man is far more dependent on other species than they are on us; as eloquently put by E. O. Wilson, ‘If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos’ (Wilson 1985 cited in Jarski 2007: 269). Notwithstanding, the power of the human species to alter its environment is undeniable. Noother living being has had as large an effect on the natural world. Sadly, much of that effect appears to have been negative. Homo sapiens sapiens was the first species to induce a wave of extinction (Ceballos et al. 2010); the previous five major extinction episodes were all the result of natural factors (primarily related to climate change, tectonics and cometary collisions). Even if precise extinction rates are hard to calculate – given that several millions of species remain unidentified and as a result of problems with extrapolation (He and Hubbell 2011) – there is little doubt that losses are highly significant. Perhaps this human propensity to impact heavily on other species has much to do with the way in which anthropogenic civilizations evolved. Early hunter-gatherer societies had no option but to work ‘with’ nature, adjusting their lives to the patterns of the seasons, and planning their movements in line with the availability of resources. With the advent of agriculture, people developed the capacity to settle in a single location, made possible by the ability to produce a steady supply (and even a surplus) of food (as opposedto merely harvesting whatever was available). This in turn enabled populations to grow to unprecedented levels, and facilitated the development of conurbations. Whilst present-day cities have undoubtedly come a long way from the earliest riverine civilizations, the fundamental trends established then remain pertinent – people settle in a location, populations grow, and corresponding resource demands increase, with the result that people need to expand their spatial footprint – and so a vicious cycle ensues. Natural landscapes have historically been big casualties of this process, with resource exploitation coming at a heavy cost to the ecosystems that ultimately sustain us. Perhaps a significant underlying driving force of this unhealthy dynamic between people andthe natural world can be found in people’s environmental ethic (or lack thereof). One could argue that as our ability to control and exploit nature increased, so correspondingly did our respect for nature decline. The use of natural resources is nothing new; in keeping with the maxim of ‘survival of the fittest’, humans need to utilize other species to survive. However, contrast a modern-day commercial livestock breeding operation (including high-density intensive breeding of species, extensive use of antibiotics and pesticides, and eventual mass slaughter at an abbatoir), with the limited hunting kills of an indigenous culture, often accompanied by rituals to pay tribute to the animal which gave its life to sustain human survival. Our western lifestyle arguably perpetuates a conception of nature as a commodity, to be used and discarded at will, and lying beyond the remit of our moral concerns. As a result, we now have a gap between ‘people’ on the one hand, and ‘nature’ on the other, with the former depending on the latter but often failing to acknowledge the limited capacity of nature to provide resources and absorb waste. In this gap, lies perhaps the key constraint to (and challenge for) sustainability. Bridging the gap requires, first and foremost, acknowledging that humans and nature are not two separate entities, but exist together interdependently as elements of a wider Earth system. It is this conception of social-ecological systems that underpins the discipline of landscape ecology. © 2013 Selection and editorial matter: Peter Howard, Ian Thompson and Emma Waterton; individual chapters: the contributors.

AB  - Soils store and fi lter water, prevent fl ooding, support the production of fuel and fibre, provide habitat, help to create landscape and are a major carbon (C) store. They are, thus, an essential component of supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services and determinants and constituents of well-being, providing security, the basic material for a good life, health and good social relations. However, calculations based on inherent land quality classes show that fertile soil (that is, soil free of constraints for agricultural production) irregularly covers no more than 12 % of the terrestrial land surface. More generally, soil fertility/quality is determined by the interactions between land management interventions by humans and the inherent physical, chemical and biological properties of a soil. Land and soil management based on the understanding of these interactions is one part of delivering food security. Even small changes in C content can have disproportionately large impacts on key soil properties. Practices to encourage maintenance of soil organic carbon (SOC) are important for ensuring sustainability of most if not all soil functions. This chapter considers the relationship between SOC and soil fertility and structure, ways of increasing SOC, some disadvantages of increasing SOC and two proposed ways of increasing SOC, fertility and sequestering C: the soil application of biochar and the cultivation of deeper rooting crops. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - The provision of hydrologic ecosystem services (HES) is critical for both human well-being and environmental sustainability. A key component in addressing current and future challenges in water resource management is the development of a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between soil properties, land use/management, and the hydrologic cycle. The soil-water interface is critical in determining the relative distribution of “blue” (i.e., irrigation, municipal supplies, aquatic ecosystems) and “green” (i.e., evapotranspiration) water usage for a given region, and therefore must be considered in the assessment of HES provisioning. The relationship between water security and food security plays a crucial role, since the agricultural sector consumes approximately 70 % of global water supply. In addition, it is projected that global agricultural yields will have to be doubled over the next 25—35 years to meet increasing demand, and that about 90 % of this increase will have to be produced on existing cultivated land. This can only be achieved with a more effi cient use of the water resources and a substantial improvement and extension of water management systems. The hydrologic functioning of soils is primarily a function of their physical, chemical, and biological properties, and in particular the amount and quality of organic carbon (C) present element. The partitioning of hydrologic fluxes into blue and green water is mainly a function of soil factors and processes that control the storage and transport of water, with soil organic matter (SOM) representing a key element. The amount of soil organic C (SOC) present will increase with specifi c land-cover/use changes (e.g., conservation tillage, mulching, agroforestry), and will be reduced or even eliminated by others (e.g., erosion, high-intensity fires), making proper land management crucial for sustaining benefi cial soil properties. The SOM quality is decisive for the fi ltering, buffering, and transformation function capacities of soils. It also controls the mobilization of dissolved organic C (DOC) which has implications on the quality of water supply. Given the increased calls for management actions to address climate change which will impact soil functioning (e.g., C sequestration, afforestation), it is important to also consider how these changes will impact individual HES and water security, and what conflicts and tradeoffs will need to be addressed. Thus, provisioning of HES must be integrated in coordinated actions of resource planning and land management on the appropriate landscape scale (i.e., the watershed). Such a process may benefi t from information resulting from integrated catchment modelling that systematically assesses land management/soil-feedback scenarios. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - Through its natural capital, soil generates numerous ecosystem services for ecological functions and human wellbeing. These include provisional (feed, food, fiber, fuel, raw material), life support (cleansing, recycling) and cultural (aesthetical, intellectual, spiritual) services. Ecosystem services such as carbon (C) sequestration are generated through a close interaction of the pedosphere with atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and lithosphere. Land misuse and soil mismanagement can degrade soil quality, and either reduces quantity and quality of ecosystem services or leads to disservices and creates large ecological footprints. By increasing the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, soil biological, chemical and physical quality can be improved which in turn improves ecosystem services. There exist relationships among multiple ecosystem services, increase in one can decrease the other through trade-offs. Payments for ecosystem services, based on rational and objective criteria can minimize risks of overshoot of incentives for enhancing ecosystem services and promote sustainable use offinite and often fragile natural resources. Transdisciplinary collaborations including collaborations between scientists and extra-scientifi c actors and means of interdisciplinary collaboration are required to tackle the complexity of social-ecological issues associated with soil’s ecosystem services. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - Security has tended to be seen as based on military force, yet this illusion is crumbling, literally and figuratively, before our eyes in the conflict zones of Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa. It is now clear that real human security, defined by the Commission on Human Security as 'protecting vital freedoms', can only be achieved if the full range of issues that underpin human security - including environmental integrity - are addressed. This ground-breaking book, authored by prominent international decision makers, tackles the global human security problem across the range of core issues including terrorism, nuclear proliferation, access to water, food security, loss of biodiversity and climate change. The authors identify the causes of insecurity, articulate the linkages between the different elements of human security and outline an agenda for engaging stakeholders from across the globe in building the foundations of genuine and lasting human security for all nations and all people. This is powerful, necessary, solution-focused reading in these times of peril, global conflict, mass inequity and rampant environmental degradation. © Stakeholder Forum for Our Common Future.

AB  - Soil’s ecosystem services (ESs), provisions of tangible goods and intangible environments and processes, are governed by its capital endowment (inherent characteristics such as clay content) and capacity to transform managerial inputs into productivity. Thus, soil quality refers to its capacity to provide and sustain a range of ESs and functions of interest to human and for maintenance of ecosystem health. Provisions of these services and functions also depend on land use (e.g., arable, pastoral, silvicultural, urban, recreational, spiritual). Because of strong interactivity, management to enhance some ESs can jeopardize others or lead to some adverse degradation processes (e.g., accelerated erosion, water pollution, decline of biodiversity). Similarly, production of biofuels can exacerbate competition with food production for land, water, energy, and nutrients. The abrupt climate change (ACC), as an example of human footprint caused by the use of natural resources, also impacts ESs and the underlying processes. Developing mechanisms and identifying/implementing policies for payments to land managers for enhancing ESs such as carbon (C) sequestration can promote adoption of best management practices (BMPs) and facilitate restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems. Recarbonization of the biosphere and sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) are important strategies to enhancing and sustaining ESs and functions of natural and managed ecosystems. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - The aims of this chapter are to describe the threats and risks to human health related to the impacts on food and nutrition and of environmental factors including those consistent with climate change and to demonstrate that global and regional strategies will be needed if adaptation and mitigation measures to reduce negative health impacts are to be effective, especially in developing countries, where the burden of ill health is already high. The climate factors that influence food and nutrition directly are heat waves, extreme weather events such as floods, sustained daytime and nighttime temperature rises, increased precipitation, and drought. Indirect impacts are also likely from changes in agrosystems and hydrology and disruptions of natural ecosystems and their effects on plant pests and disease, as well as socioeconomic and demographic factors attributable to climate. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Systems perspectives are fundamental in driving technological improvements and yield-enhancing strategies that improve agricultural productivity. These can resolve farmer's problems and are important pathways for sustaining food and nutritional security for human welfare in Asia. The essential determinants of this objective are the capacity to efficiently manage the natural resource base (land, crops, animals, and water) to resolve constraints to farming systems, and notably the integration of multiple research and development (R&D) issues through all levels of formal and non-formal learning systems. Both formal and informal education systems are important, with the former relating more to universities and colleges, and the latter to the intermediate level. Graduates from this level have the primary responsibility of introducing improved technologies and change to farmers, mainly along production and disciplinary pathways. The traditional research-extension-farmer model for technology delivery is no longer acceptable, due to "top down" extension functions and prescriptions, ineffectiveness to cope with the dynamics of production systems, complex interactions within the natural resources, effects of climate change and globalisation. There are also reservations on the technical capacity and skills of extension agents, constraints identification, methods for technology diffusion and dissemination, and innovative use of beneficial technological improvements that can directly respond to the needs of small farmers, and impact on subsistence agriculture. Agricultural education and systems perspectives are therefore an overriding compelling necessity which transcends prevailing limitations to waning agriculture and rural growth. Their wider recognition and applications provides an important means to maximise efficiency in the potential use; of the natural resources, increase engagement and investments in agriculture, promote ways to become more self-reliant in the development of crucial new technologies and intensification. These together can meet the challenges of the future and overcome the legacy of continuing poverty, food and nutritional insecurity. Asian farming systems, with their diversity of crops and animals, traditional methods, multiple cropanimal interactions, numerous problems of farmers present increasingly complex issues of natural resource management (NRM) and the environment. Many if not all of these can only be resolved by interdisciplinary R&D, which overcomes a major weakness of many R&D programmes presently and in the past. Improved education and training is a powerful and important driver of community-based participation aimed at enhancing sustainable food security, poverty reduction and social equity in which the empowerment of women in activities that support organising themselves is also an important pathway to enhance self-reliance and their contribution to agriculture. A vision for the future in which improved agricultural education in a systems context can provide the pathway to directly benefit the revitalisation of agriculture and agricultural development is proposed with a three-pronged strategy as follows: • Define policy for the development of appropriate curricular for formal agricultural education that provides strong multi-disciplinary orientation and improved understanding of the natural resources (land, crops, animals and water) and their interactions • Organise formal degree education and specialisation at the university level that reflects strong training in understanding of agricultural systems; systems perspectives, methodologies and their application, and • Define non-formal education and training needs that can be intensified at different levels, including the trainin of trainers as agents of change. The agenda and strategies for improving agriculture needs to take a holistic and innovative view of ways to transform the diminishing resource base, potential of rainfed areas to increase food production, improved yield-enhancing technology application including the use of ruminants as the entry point for development, poverty complex, food and nutrition security, and environmental management.

AB  - This study, supported by the Challenge ProgramWater and Food (CPWF-Project 35), demonstrates the case of multiple-use of water through seasonal aquaculture interventions for improved rice-fish production systems in the Bangladesh floodplains. The project focused on community-based fish culture initiatives, increasingly adopted in the agro-ecological zones of the major floodplains of the Padma, Testa, and Brahmaputra basin. The productivity of water and fish is used as an indicator to explain this case.We hypothesize that seasonal aquaculture supported by the management of floodplains for multiple-use of water can significantly increase the productivity of rice-fish systems. Recognizing the need for innovative ways to manage human-dominated landscapes and climate-sensitive ecosystems such as floodplains, we have analysed seasonal aquaculture interventions along with local adaptation of water management strategies, including the consideration of groundwater mechanisms. The results, supported by quantitative analysis and qualitative arguments, demonstrate the significant contribution of seasonal aquaculture in improving the rice-fish production systems of the selected floodplain sites. This was achieved through the increased productivity of water and fish and the reduction of the risk posed by arsenic contamination. The study is also illustrative of the diversification in livelihood-generating activities to cope with the extended period of flooding cycle in the region. We highlight the value of multiple resource-use approaches to enhance the social and ecological resilience of floodplains, and the need to re-consider basin water management options to recognize the water requirements of other sources of food such as fish produced by capture fisheries and aquaculture. © 2012 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.

AB  - Land is an indispensable natural resource for human, without which we cannot survive and develop. Land-use change, influenced by both natural environment and human activity, has a close relationship with food security, resource utilization, biodiversity and climate change. In order to understand the process and driving mechanism of land-use change, dynamic models were developed in these years, among which Dinamica EGO is a practical one and has been widely used in the world. In this paper, we aim to use Dinamica EGO to simulate the land-use of China in 2005 with data extracted from SPOT VGT NDVI. The real land-use map was compared with the simulation result so as to verify the feasibility of Dinamica EGO. Then we supposed three sceneries under which we could analyze the land-use change of China in 2020. Results indicated that: on the basis of no extreme natural disasters or exceptional policy fluctuation, the grassland area would reduce by 22.21 million hectares averagely. However forest would increase by 19.81 billion hectares on average. Water and unused land would probably remain stable as there was little change in three sceneries. Farmland areas showed a good agreement under these sceneries whereas the greatest difference in land-use area estimations lies in built-up with an uncertainty accounting for 1.67%. © 2012 SPIE.

AB  - Climate change, fishing, and aquaculture have affected and will continue to influence Canadian marine biodiversity, albeit at different spatial scales. The Arctic is notably affected by reduced quality and quantity of sea ice caused by global warming, and by concomitant and forecasted changes in ocean productivity, species ecology, and human activity. The Atlantic has been especially impacted by severe overfishing and human-induced alterations to food webs. Climate change, fishing, and aquaculture have all affected, to varying degrees, biodiversity on Canada's Pacific coast. Past and projected trends in key biodiversity stressors reveal marked change. Oceanographic trends include increasing surface water temperatures, reduced salinity, increased acidity, and, in some areas, reduced oxygen. Reductions in Canada's fishery catches (those in 2009 were half those of the late 1980s), followed by reductions in fishing pressure, are associated with dramatic changes in the species composition of commercial catches in the Atlantic (formerly groundfish, now predominantly invertebrates and pelagic fish) and the Pacific (formerly salmon, now predominantly groundfish). Aquaculture, dominated by the farming of Atlantic salmon, grew rapidly from the early 1980s until 2002 and has since stabilized. Climate change is forecast to affect marine biodiversity by shifting species distributions, changing species community composition, decoupling the timing of species' resource requirements and resource availability, and reducing habitat quality. Harvest-related reductions in fish abundance, many by 80% or more, coupled with fishing-induced changes to food webs, are impairing the capacity of species to recover or even persist. Open-sea aquaculture net pens affect biodiversity by (i) habitat alteration resulting from organic wastes, chemical inputs, and use of nonnative species; (ii) exchange of pathogens between farmed and wild species; and (iii) interbreeding between wild fish and farmed escapees. Physical and biological changes in the oceans, along with direct anthropogenic impacts, are modifying Canadian marine biodiversity with implications for food security and the social and economic well-being of coastal communities. To assess the consequences of changes in biodiversity for Canada's oceans and society, it is necessary to understand the current state of marine biodiversity and how it might be affected by projected changes in climate and human uses. © 2012 Published by NRC Research Press.

AB  - Protected areas remain a cornerstone of global conservation efforts. The double impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss are major threats to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, especially those relating to environmental sustainability, poverty alleviation and food and water security. The growing awareness of the planet's vulnerability to human driven changes also provides an opportunity to re-emphasize the multiple values of natural ecosystems and the services that they provide. Protected areas, when integrated into landuse plans as part of larger and connected conservation networks, offer practical, tangible solutions to the problems of both species loss and adaptation to climate change. Natural habitats make a significant contribution to mitigation by storing and sequestering carbon in vegetation and soils, and to adaptation by maintaining essential ecosystem services which help societies to respond to, and cope with climate change and other environmental challenges. Many protected areas could be justified on socioeconomic grounds alone yet their multiple goods and services are largely unrecognized in national accounting. This paper argues that there is a convincing case for greater investment in expanded and better-connected protected area systems, under a range of governance and management regimes that are specifically designed to counter the threats of climate change, increased demand and altered patterns of resource use. The new agenda for protected areas requires greater inclusivity of a broader spectrum of actors and rights holders, with growing attention to landscapes and seascapes protected by indigenous peoples, local communities, private owners and other actors which complement conservation areas managed by state agencies. Greater attention also needs to be focused on ways to integrate and mainstream protected areas into sustainable development, including promotion of "green" infrastructure as a strategic part of responses to climate change. © Author(s) 2012.

AB  - In the coming decades, a crucial challenge for humanity will be meeting future food demands without undermining further the integrity of the Earth's environmental systems. Agricultural systems are already major forces of global environmental degradation, but population growth and increasing consumption of calorie-and meat-intensive diets are expected to roughly double human food demand by 2050 (ref. 3). Responding to these pressures, there is increasing focus on 'sustainable intensification' as a means to increase yields on underperforming landscapes while simultaneously decreasing the environmental impacts of agricultural systems. However, it is unclear what such efforts might entail for the future of global agricultural landscapes. Here we present a global-scale assessment of intensification prospects from closing 'yield gaps' (differences between observed yields and those attainable in a given region), the spatial patterns of agricultural management practices and yield limitation, and the management changes that may be necessary to achieve increased yields. We find that global yield variability is heavily controlled by fertilizer use, irrigation and climate. Large production increases (45% to 70% for most crops) are possible from closing yield gaps to 100% of attainable yields, and the changes to management practices that are needed to close yield gaps vary considerably by region and current intensity. Furthermore, we find that there are large opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture by eliminating nutrient overuse, while still allowing an approximately 30% increase in production of major cereals (maize, wheat and rice). Meeting the food security and sustainability challenges of the coming decades is possible, but will require considerable changes in nutrient and water management. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - This article explores the drivers, benefits, and challenges facing climate change adaptation in the Maldives. It specifically investigates the "Integrating Climate Change Risks into Resilient Island Planning in the Maldives" Program, or ICCR, a four-year $9.3 million adaptation project being funded by the Least Developed Countries Fund, Maldivian Government and the United Nations Development Program, and nationally executed by the Ministry of Housing, Transport and Environment of the Maldivian Government. The article asks: what is the perception of coastal adaptation in the Maldives, and what are the potential contributions from the ICCR project? To answer this question, the article summarizes eight primary sectors vulnerable to climate change in the Maldives: human settlements, critical infrastructure, tourism, fisheries, health systems, water, food security, and coral reef biodiversity. It then describes the genesis and background behind the ICCR, which addresses many of these vulnerabilities by demonstrating coastal protection measures. Benefits to the ICCR include improving physical resilience by deploying "soft" infrastructure, institutional resilience by training policymakers and enhancing good governance, and community resilience by strengthening community assets and awareness. Challenges include ensuring that adaptation efforts are enough to truly respond to climate vulnerability, lack of coordination, and short-term thinking among business and community leaders. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - In Cuba, since 1959, the energy, environment and socio-economic development have been given high priority in national development plans. Fifty years later, the Cuban people have achieved a society with notable advances in literacy and education, health, culture, sports, social security and per capita of the gross domestic product (GDP), which has permitted the attainment of a sustainable development, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report in 2006. The energy sector has been evolving constantly in the last 50 years, achieving as the main result the distribution of electricity to 97% of the country, the growth of domestic oil production to achieve about 47% of the total consumption, the introduction of the distributed generation of electricity reaching 40% on the generation, rehabilitation of the electric appliances, systematization of the Cuban Electricity Conservation Program (PAEC), the Energy Conservation Program of the Ministry of Education (PAEME) and rapid introduction of renewable energy technologies, with good results in demand side management, energy efficiency and energy education. Actually, soil degradation, deforestation, pollution, loss of biological diversity and lack of water have been identified as the main environmental problems; several plans and projects have been applied, in order to reduce their impact, following the policy expressed in the National Environmental Strategy. However, challenges exist for future development in Cuba in coming years, from an economical point of view will be necessary the enhancement of the economic relations with the American and European countries, to solve internal problems such as insufficient productivity, correspondence between the level of activities with the financial, material and human resources, to promote growth in the levels of exports and to achieve the substitution of imported basic food; the energy sector need to achieve growth in the levels of prospection and exploitation of domestic oil, to diversify fossil energy and energetic technologies suppliers, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy; the protection of the environment will demand to develop research about adaptation and mitigation of climate change, conservation and rational use of natural resources, in particular, the lands, water and forests. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent high-profile efforts have called for integrating ecosystemservice values into important societal decisions, but there are few demonstrations of this approach in practice. We quantified ecosystem-service values to help the largest private landowner in Hawaii, Kamehameha Schools, design a land-use development plan that balances multiple private and public values on its North Shore land holdings (Island of O'ahu) of ∼10,600 ha. We used the InVEST software tool to evaluate the environmental and financial implications of seven planning scenarios encompassing contrasting land-use combinations including biofuel feedstocks, food crops, forestry, livestock, and residential development. All scenarios had positive financial return relative to the status quo of negative return. However, tradeoffs existed between carbon storage and water quality as well as between environmental improvement and financial return. Based on this analysis and community input, Kamehameha Schools is implementing a plan to support diversified agriculture and forestry. This plan generates a positive financial return ($10.9 million) and improved carbon storage (0.5% increase relative to status quo) with negative relative effects on water quality (15.4% increase in potential nitrogen export relative to status quo). The effects on water quality could be mitigated partially (reduced to a 4.9% increase in potential nitrogen export) by establishing vegetation buffers on agricultural fields. This plan contributes to policy goals for climate change mitigation, food security, and diversifying rural economic opportunities. More broadly, our approach illustrates how information can help guide local land-use decisions that involve tradeoffs between private and public interests.

AB  - The global importance of grasslands is indicated by their extent; they comprise some 26% of total land area and 80% of agriculturally productive land. The majority of grasslands are located in tropical developing countries where they are particularly important to the livelihoods of some one billion poor peoples. Grasslands clearly provide the feed base for grazing livestock and thus numerous high-quality foods, but such livestock also provide products such as fertilizer, transport, traction, fibre and leather. In addition, grasslands provide important services and roles including as water catchments, biodiversity reserves, for cultural and recreational needs, and potentially a carbon sink to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions. Inevitably, such functions may conflict with management for production of livestock products. Much of the increasing global demand for meat and milk, particularly from developing countries, will have to be supplied from grassland ecosystems, and this will provide difficult challenges. Increased production of meat and milk generally requires increased intake of metabolizable energy, and thus increased voluntary intake and/or digestibility of diets selected by grazing animals. These will require more widespread and effective application of improved management. Strategies to improve productivity include fertilizer application, grazing management, greater use of crop by-products, legumes and supplements and manipulation of stocking rate and herbage allowance. However, it is often difficult to predict the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of such strategies, particularly in tropical developing country production systems. Evaluation and on-going adjustment of grazing systems require appropriate and reliable assessment criteria, but these are often lacking. A number of emerging technologies may contribute to timely low-cost acquisition of quantitative information to better understand the soil-pasture-animal interactions and animal management in grassland systems. Development of remote imaging of vegetation, global positioning technology, improved diet markers, near IR spectroscopy and modelling provide improved tools for knowledge-based decisions on the productivity constraints of grazing animals. Individual electronic identification of animals offers opportunities for precision management on an individual animal basis for improved productivity. Improved outcomes in the form of livestock products, services and/or other outcomes from grasslands should be possible, but clearly a diversity of solutions are needed for the vast range of environments and social circumstances of global grasslands. © 2012 The Animal Consortium.

AB  - Tropical coral reefs form some of the richest ecosystems on Earth. Though representing less than 0.1% of the total ocean surface, coral reefs host approximately 25% of all marine species. Along with their high biodiversity, coral reefs support the livelihood of millions of people around the world through supply of food, resources, and coastal protection, plus their natural beauty attracts tourists that support associated industries. Coral reefs are complex three-dimensional structures, with an array of habitats and environmental niches. They are also one of the most vulnerable ecosystems on our planet, currently under direct threat from human activities including climate change, decreased water quality, and increased nutrient loads. The microbial community is fundamental to the functioning, health, and resilience of these coral reef ecosystems. Understanding how environmental stress affects microbial communities and their processes will allow us to better predict the resilience of coral reefs during changes in nutrient cycling and disease epidemics. This chapter explores the important role of microbial communities in keystone reef organisms such as reef-building Scleractinian corals and benthic filter-feeding sponges. These species represent the best studied systems in coral reefs for invertebrate-bacterial interactions. Diversity and function of microbial communities in the sediments and overlying seawater are also explored with microbially driven nutrient cycling in these habitats closely coupled to reef productivity. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Humans are currently confronted by many global challenges. These include achieving food security for a rapidly expanding population, lowering the risk of climate change by reducing the net release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere due to human activity, and meeting the increasing demand for energy in the face of dwindling reserves of fossil energy and uncertainties about future reliability of supply. Legumes deliver several important services to societies. They provide important sources of oil, fiber, and protein-rich food and feed while supplying nitrogen (N) to agro-ecosystems via their unique ability to fix atmospheric N2 in symbiosis with the soil bacteria rhizobia, increasing soil carbon content, and stimulating the productivity of the crops that follow. However, the role of legumes has rarely been considered in the context of their potential to contribute to the mitigation of climate change by reducing fossil fuel use or by providing feedstock for the emerging biobased economies where fossil sources of energy and industrial raw materials are replaced in part by sustainable and renewable biomass resources. The aim of this review was to collate the current knowledge regarding the capacity of legumes to (1) lower the emissions of the key greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) compared to N-fertilized systems, (2) reduce the fossil energy used in the production of food and forage, (3) contribute to the sequestration of carbon (C) in soils, and (4) provide a viable source of biomass for the generation of biofuels and other materials in future biorefinery concepts. We estimated that globally between 350 and 500 Tg CO2 could be emitted as a result of the 33 to 46 Tg N that is biologically fixed by agricultural legumes each year. This compares to around 300 Tg CO2 released annually from the manufacture of 100 Tg fertilizer N. The main difference is that the CO2 respired from the nodulated roots of N2-fixing legumes originated from photosynthesis and will not represent a net contribution to atmospheric concentrations of CO2, whereas the CO2 generated during the synthesis of N fertilizer was derived from fossil fuels. Experimental measures of total N2O fluxes from legumes and N-fertilized systems were found to vary enormously (0.03-7.09 and 0.09-18.16 kg N2O-N ha?1, respectively). This reflected the data being collated from a diverse range of studies using different rates of N inputs, as well as the large number of climatic, soil, and management variables known to influence denitrification and the portion of the total N lost as N2O. Averages across 71 site-years of data, soils under legumes emitted a total of 1.29 kg N2O-N ha?1 during a growing season. This compared to a mean of 3.22 kg N2O-N ha?1 from 67 site-years of N-fertilized crops and pastures, and 1.20 kg N2O-N ha?1 from 33 site-years of data collected from unplanted soils or unfertilized nonlegumes. It was concluded that there was little evidence that biological N2 fixation substantially contributed to total N2O emissions, and that losses of N2O from legume soil were generally lower than N-fertilized systems, especially when commercial rates of N fertilizer were applied. Elevated rates of N2O losses can occur following the termination of legume-based pastures, or where legumes had been green-or brown-manured and there was a rapid build-up of high concentrations of nitrate in soil. Legume crops and legume-based pastures use 35% to 60% less fossil energy than N-fertilized cereals or grasslands, and the inclusion of legumes in cropping sequences reduced the average annual energy usage over a rotation by 12% to 34%. The reduced energy use was primarily due to the removal of the need to apply N fertilizer and the subsequently lower N fertilizer requirements for crops grown following legumes. Life cycle energy balances of legume-based rotations were also assisted by a lower use of agrichemicals for crop protection as diversification of cropping sequences reduce the incidence of cereal pathogens and pests and assisted weed control, although it was noted that differences in fossil energy use between legumes and Nfertilized systems were greatly diminished if energy use was expressed per unit of biomass or grain produced. For a change in land use to result in a net increase C sequestration in soil, the inputs of C remaining in plant residues need to exceed the CO2 respired by soil microbes during the decomposition of plant residues or soil organic C, and the C lost through wind or water erosion. The net N-balance of the system was a key driver of changes in soil C stocks in many environments, and data collected from pasture, cropping, and agroforestry systems all indicated that legumes played a pivotal role in providing the additional organic N required to encourage the accumulation of soil C at rates greater than can be achieved by cereals or grasses even when they were supplied with N fertilizer. Legumes contain a range of compounds, which could be refined to produce raw industrial materials currently manufactured from petroleum-based sources, pharmaceuticals, surfactants, or food additives as valuable by-products if legume biomass was to be used to generate biodiesel, bioethanol, biojet A1 fuel, or biogas. The attraction of using leguminous material feedstock is that they do not need the inputs of N fertilizer that would otherwise be necessary to support the production of high grain yields or large amounts of plant biomass since it is the high fossil energy use in the synthesis, transport, and application of N fertilizers that often negates much of the net C benefits of many other bioenergy sources. The use of legume biomass for biorefineries needs careful thought as there will be significant trade-offs with the current role of legumes in contributing to the organic fertility of soils. Agricultural systems will require novel management and plant breeding solutions to provide the range of options that will be required to mitigate climate change. Given their array of ecosystem services and their ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower the use of fossil energy, accelerate rates of C sequestration in soil, and provide a valuable source of feedstock for biorefineries, legumes should be considered as important components in the development of future agroecosystems. © INRA and Springer-Verlag, France 2011.

AB  - Climate change is a large-scale and emerging environmental risk. It challenges environmental health and the sustainability of global development. Wastewater irrigation can make a sterling contribution to reducing water demand, recycling nutrients, improving soil health and cutting the amount of pollutants discharged into the waterways. However, the resource must be carefully managed to protect the environment and public health. Actions promoting wastewater reuse are every where, yet the frameworks for the protection of human health and the environment are lacking in most developing countries. Global change drivers including climate change, population growth, urbanization, income growth, improvements in living standard, industrialization, and energy intensive lifestyle will all heighten water management challenges. Slowing productivity growth, falling investment in irrigation, loss of biodiversity, risks to public health, environmental health issues such as soil salinity, land degradation, land cover change and water quality issues add an additional layer of complexity. Against this backdrop, the potential for wastewater irrigation and its benefits and risks are examined. These include crop productivity, aquaculture, soil health, groundwater quality, environmental health, public health, infrastructure constraints, social concerns and risks, property values, social equity, and poverty reduction. It is argued that, wastewater reuse and nutrient capture can contribute towards climate change adaptation and mitigation. Benefits such as avoided freshwater pumping and energy savings, fertilizer savings, phosphorous capture and prevention of mineral fertilizer extraction from mines can reduce carbon footprint and earn carbon credits. Wastewater reuse in agriculture reduces the water footprint of food production on the environment; it also entails activities such as higher crop yields and changes in cropping patterns, which also reduce carbon footprint. However, there is a need to better integrate water reuse into core water governance frameworks in order to effectively address the challenges and harness the potential of this vital resource for environmental health protection. The paper also presents a blueprint for future water governance and public policies for the protection of environmental health. © 2011.

AB  - Background: A participatory watershed management approach is one of the tested, sustainable and eco-friendly options to upgrade rain-fed agriculture to meet growing food demand along with additional multiple benefits in terms of improving livelihoods, addressing equity issues and biodiversity concerns. Results: Watershed interventions at study sites in Thailand (Tad Fa and Wang Chai) and India (Kothapally) effectively reduced runoff and the associated soil loss. Such interventions at Xiaoxincun (China) and Wang Chai improved groundwater recharging and availability. Enhanced productive transpiration increased rainwater use efficiency for crop production by 13-29% at Xiaoxincun; 13-160% at Lucheba (China), 32-37% at Tad Fa and 23-46% at Wang Chai and by two to five times at Kothapally. Watershed interventions increased significantly the additional net returns from crop production as compared with the pre-watershed intervention period. Increased water availability opened up options for crop diversification with high-value crops, including increased forage production and boosted livestock-based livelihoods. Conclusion: In dryland tropics, integrated watershed management approach enabled farmers to diversify the systems along with increasing agricultural productivity through increased water availability, while conserving the natural resource base. Household incomes increased substantially, leading to improved living and building the resilience of the community and natural resources. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The Mekong River is the longest watercourse in Southeast Asia. Although China has an extensive hydropower program underway on the Upper Mekong, as yet there are no dams on the river's lower mainstream. However, as many as 12 additional projects, which would generate substantial energy and wealth especially for Cambodia and Laos, are currently in the proposal stage for the Lower Mekong (LM). The cumulative effects of the LM hydropower projects - if built, and together with existing Chinese dams - will transform the Mekong by altering natural flow patterns and disrupting fisheries and other ecosystem services, to the detriment of the millions of people who depend on the river for their livelihoods. Proposals for new dam construction are driven by several factors, including changing human demographics and development needs, energy and food security concerns, economic cooperation, and climate change. We link these social, ecological, economic, and political forces to ongoing regional governance issues and discuss how to improve the quality of Mekong hydropower decision making in a complex, transboundary setting. © The Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Coastal environments are among the most productive on the planet, providing a wide range of ecosystem services. Development and exploitation mean that they are faced with stresses from a number of anthropogenic sources. Such stresses are typically studied in isolation, but multiple stressors can combine in unexpected ways to alter the structure of ecological systems. Here, we experimentally explore the impacts of inorganic nutrients and organic matter on a range of food web properties. We find that these two stressors combine additively to produce significant increases in connectance and mean food chain length. Such increases are typically associated with enhanced robustness to secondary extinctions and productivity, respectively. Despite these apparent beneficial effects, we find a simplification of web structure in terms of taxon richness and diversity, and altered proportions of basal and top species. These effects are driven by a reduction in community assembly and lower consistency in a range of system properties as a result of the multiple stressors. Consequently, impacted food webs are likely to be more vulnerable to human- or climate-induced perturbations in the long term. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) remains the only 'Rio Convention' that is not well served by the scientific community and lacks the equivalent of an IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) or the proposed IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services). The mounting pressures on land (and water) that can drive its degradation include population growth and associated food security concerns, over use, creeping degradation, competition between agriculture and renewable energy production, carbon sequestration and land acquisition by foreign entities. These environmental and human pressures clearly require urgent policy attention. We report the results of a survey of the scientific community on the need and possible options for a science-policy platform that focuses on land. The paper then describes the remit and role of an independent platform, the benefits and possible modalities that are inclusive and build on existing institutional structures. Both short-term and longer term options are presented that can respond to immediate needs while establishing a mechanism that can handle the interacting and sometimes overlapping aspects of land covered by other Multilateral Environment Agreements (MEAs). Short-term options include establishing a platform via an ad hoc working group within the proposed IPBES that would feed its outputs into the UNCCD and other relevant MEAs. Long-term options include a more polycentric approach, establishing a network of networks that could evolve into a fully-fledged Independent Platform on Land Degradation given sufficient support, interest and leadership from the international and donor communities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Drought is a normal, recurring feature of climate in most parts of the world (Wilhite, 2000) that adversely affects vegetation conditions and can have significant impacts on agriculture, ecosystems, food security, human health, water resources, and the economy. For example, in the United States, 14 billion-dollar drought events occurred between 1980 and 2009 (NCDC, 2010), with a large proportion of the losses coming from the agricultural sector in the form of crop yield reductions and degraded hay/pasture conditions. During the 2002 drought, Hayes et al. (2004) found that many individual states across the United States experienced more than $1 billion in agriculture losses associated with both crops and livestock. The impact of drought on vegetation can have serious water resource implications as the use of finite surface and groundwater supplies to support agricultural crop production competes against other sectoral water interests (e.g., environmental, commercial, municipal, and recreation). Drought-related vegetation stress can also have various ecological impacts. Prime examples include widespread piñon pine tree die-off in the southwest United States due to protracted severe drought stress and associated bark beetle infestations (Breshears et al., 2005) and the geographic shift of a forest-woodland ecotone in this region in response to severe drought in the mid-1950s (Allen and Breshears, 1998). Tree mortality in response to extended drought periods has also been observed in other parts of the western United States (Guarin and Taylor, 2005), as well as in boreal (Kasischke and Turetsky, 2006), temperate (Fensham and Holman, 1999), and tropical (Williamson et al., 2000) forests. Droughts have also served as a catalyst for changes in wildfire activity (Swetnam and Betancourt, 1998; Westerling et al., 2006) and invasive plant species establishment (Everard et al., 2010). © 2012 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Environmental changes and human activities can alter the earth’s ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, which are critical to sustaining the earth’s living environment. Ecosystems respond continuously to environmental change and variability as well as to numerous disturbances caused by human activities and natural events. Responses include changes in ecosystem distribution and extent, impacts on natural resources (e.g., food, fiber, fuel, and pharmaceutical products), ecosystem services (e.g., treatment of water and air, climate and weather regulation, carbon and nutrient storage and cycling, habitat, maintenance of water resources), and variations in fundamental processes, including exchanges of energy, momentum, trace gases, and aerosols with the atmosphere, which in turn influence climate. Vegetation properties are key elements in the study of the global carbon cycle and ecosystems. Monitoring global vegetation properties from space can contribute significantly in improving our understanding of land surface processes and their interactions with the atmosphere, biogeochemical cycle, and primary productivity. © 2012 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In recent decades, global climate change has continued to cause devastating impacts to various places on Earth. Geographic and socioeconomic characteristics in East Africa (EA) and South America (SA) make the regions among the most vulnerable to the current temperature variations attracting several studies with wider implications. Presently, in these two regions, remarkable evidence of climate change includes repeated droughts and increase in dry lands affecting water and food availability for humans, livestock, and wildlife (EA), intensification of climate- sensitive diseases, sea level rise, fast retreat of glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Kenya in Kenya, and Andeans Mountains of South America, change in the rainfall patterns in the Amazon forests and in the whole of EA, and increasing of the frequency and intensity of the El Nino and La Nina phenomenon in the South Pacific that affect both EA and SA, among others. Although these two regions are not major contributors of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the poor conservation of strategic ecosystems through deforestation of the Amazon forests in SA and various forests in EA coupled with intensification of agriculture, land degradation, rapid rates of urbanization and industrialization all driven by rapid population increase are putting a strain on valuable natural resources whose conservation would be critical in mitigating climate change. Adaptation measures have been constrained by climate change impacts. In both regions, poverty is widespread and climate change impacts have jeopardized most poverty alleviation initiatives including realization of some of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Moreover, both regions have a strong dependency on rain-fed agriculture for economic development with hydroelectricity and biomass as main sources of energy. Consequently, adaptation measures are required for all the sectors, but especially in agriculture, health, and energy where the loss of soil productivity, increasing spread of climate-sensitive diseases, reduction of water and energy source supply are already threatening the social and economic security of both regions. Both regions have a wealth of indigenous knowledge and coping mechanisms of various local communities that should be incorporated into conventional adaptation measures of climate change. This chapter describes the main climate change impacts in EA and SA, vulnerabilities thereon, and adaptation measures that offer an opportunity to the two regions to develop in a sustainable way. © 2012.

AB  - The terrestrial C pool, 3,900 Pg comprising of C in soil and the vegetation, is the third largest after the oceanic and the geological pools. Rather than with the on-set of the Industrial Revolution around 1800 AD, the Anthropocene may have commenced 10–12 millennia ago with the dawn of settled agriculture. Given this hypothesis, the terrestrial biosphere may have lost as much as 480 Pg C, of which 70–100 Pg may have been depleted from the world’s soils. Whereas most of the C emitted from the terrestrial biosphere may have been reabsorbed by the ocean and the land-based sinks, the depleted C pool created a C sink capacity that can be refilled through conversion to judicious land use(s) and adoption of recommended management practices of soil, vegetation and domesticated animals. Principal biomes for C sequestration, those with high capacity for C sequestration/emission avoidance and with numerous co-benefits, are peatlands and wetlands, degraded soils and desertified ecosystems, soils of agroecosystems and urban lands. Effective erosion control can also avoid emissions exacerbated by mineralization of C transported in runoff and eroded sediments and redistributed over the landscape. In addition to mitigating climate change, other co-benefits of C sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere are advancing food security, improving quality and quantity of water resources, and increasing the habitat and total biodiversity. Being an engine of economic development, improvements in productivity of agricultural, forestry and other managed ecosystems can advance the Millennium Development Goals, promote political and social stability, and improve standards of living. This is a winwin option in the context of climatic, environmental, political, economic and social issues facing the Carbon Civilization of the twenty-first century. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

AB  - Weeds not only adversely affect the plant productivity but many of them also cause health hazards in human beings and animals. They are also known to seriously affect the biodiversity. Apart from this negative side, many weeds are known to have beneficial properties in one way or the other and have immense potential as food and fodder, medicinal, aromatic, phytoremediation, industrial, soil and water conservation resources, etc. A very little information is available on the use of weeds for such beneficial purposes. Therefore, this subject of research needs to be explored and expanded. Several of the weeds are utilized for (a) soil and water conservation, (b) alternative livelihood opportunities, and (c) industrial uses. Survey of published literature indicates that there is great scope for application of weeds in bioremediation. More research efforts are required for utilizing weeds for bioremediation of different type of pollutants from air, water, and soil. Ornamental plants have an added advantage of enhancing the environmental esthetics besides cleaning the environment. This approach has several advantages for environmental moderation, cleanup, and generation of revenue. Therefore, this approach will add a new dimension to the field of bioremediation of contaminated aquatic and terrestrial environments. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

AB  - Biodiversity matters to everyone. Its loss impoverishes the environment and reduces its capacity to support people now and in the future. Impact assessment can help to ensure that development is compatible with the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. These are the opening words of the biodiversity in impact assessment principles formulated by the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA, 2005) and perfectly set the stage for a book that stresses the dependency of humanity on benefits from biodiversity, explores how present and future environmental securities are linked with biodiversity, and stimulates the need to balance the need for conservation with that for human development through sustainable use of biodiversity. Through his simple quote in Closing Circle - ‘Everything is connected to everything else’, Barry Commoner (1971) conveyed the importance of interconnectedness between the different components of the living world. Human activities do not occur in a vacuum but are an inherent part of complex biological systems, such as food chains, and large-scale abiotic processes, such as the water cycle or climate change. This interconnectedness helps us to understand that most ecological systems are complex, making it difficult to come to a consensus on cause-and-effect relationships. If we are to develop truly sustainable economies and ensure the perpetuity of the ecosystem benefits that drive economies and human well-being, we must have a better grasp of the intricate relationship between the environment and the factors that bring about changes. Moreover, we must make sure that available knowledge is used in the best possible way to support day-to-day decision making on large human interventions. © Cambridge University Press 2010.

AB  - In the Anthropocene, processes and response feedbacks to soil-ecosystems have accelerated, jeopardizing the sustainability of the soil resource at local, regional, national, and global scales. Soil-ecosystems are at the heart of the critical zone and sustain life on Earth by providing a quasi non-renewable resource that, once degraded, is extremely slow to restore. Yet global change, such as population growth, climate change, and drastically altered land use, imposes profound imprints onto soil-ecosystems impacting soil quality, biodiversity, and food security. Questions emerge about the role of digital soil mapping (DSM) in the context of a changing world. Implementations of contemporary digital soil models have emphasized mapping of soil-forming or SCORPAN factors assuming that they are more or less static to infer on soil properties or classes. This perspective is constraining and does not capture soil evolution, i.e., the change of soil properties and their environmental covariates through time. We have proposed to enhance conceptual soil models to explicitly incorporate the soil-ecosystem evolution and anthropogenic forcings into the modeling process. Our space-time modeling framework, called STEPAWBH ("step-up"), consists of soil (S), topographic (T), ecological (E), geologic (P), atmospheric (A), water (W), and biotic properties (B) as well as human-induced forcings (H) to predict pixel-based soil properties or behavior. We discuss how contemporary DSM can be expanded to enhance capabilities to respond to grand challenges we face at global scale linked to sustainability, vulnerability, adaptability, and risk assessments of soil-ecosystems across multiple spatial and temporal scales. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The recent paper on Africa's groundwater byMacDonald etal (2012) has attracted much attention. This is good news, especially since groundwater has been widely ignored, misunderstood or abused, as a fundamental global resource. This important paper goes a long way to raising the profile of groundwater in Africa by providing first-order estimates of the available storage (taking account of saturated aquifer thickness and porosity) as well as mapping expected water yields (aquifer productivity) in that continent. Reliable estimates of groundwater resources can now be set against the far more widely reported surface water availability. The constraints of the methodology used to compile these maps are duly acknowledged, and are well within the hydrogeological state-of-the-art. The paper is backed by carefully reviewed sources of data and a considerable effort has been made to incorporate the extensive grey literature. It is important that this benchmark study is received with the acclaim it deserves. However, the headline - that groundwater storage is some 100 times the annual renewable surface waters - could be misconstrued as implying that groundwater is an abundant new resource, which it is not. Whilst groundwater is key to sustainable development, renewability and accessibility issues need to be addressed. The paper may therefore be seized upon to justify unsustainable groundwater exploitation, or to provide an argument against funding to NGOs and others, for water provision for needy communities. Some constraints that must be taken into account are elaborated here. The conclusions of the paper (MacDonald etal 2012) demonstrate that modest yields of groundwater are quite widely available at accessible depths and sufficient to sustain small communities and their development, but larger yields (&gt;5ls -1) suitable for urban development or major agricultural schemes are unlikely outside of the sedimentary terrain. The availability and accessibility of groundwater over much of Africa, therefore, is favourable to rural rather than urban development. One of the real opportunities presented in the paper is that groundwater should be more widely used for a revolution in rural development. To this end, the use of managed aquifer recharge (MAR), coupled with other forms of rainwater harvesting, can also locally conserve and augment groundwater resources and offer obvious advantages over building surface water storage. The large sedimentary aquifers of Africa contain some 0.66millionkm3 in storage (MacDonald etal 2012); but most of this water (0.44Mkm3) is contained beneath eight Saharan countries (see table 1, MacDonald etal 2012). This includes the Nubian Sandstone aquifer system, underlying Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad. In Libya this immense high yielding aquifer may be over 2.5km thick(Pallas 1980) but considerable depths to the water table make for costly development. Water in Libya is currently being extracted (mined) from remote inland areas for transmission to the coast, from wells typically 300-500m deep with estimated well-field lifetimes unlikely to exceed 50years (Pallas and Salem 2001). This and the other Saharan aquifers are accessible only to a very small fraction of the African population. Groundwater extraction and transmission is possible only with the energy provided from the proximity of fossil fuels; large water transfer schemes are energy intensive and for most areas of Africa not an economic option, having also social and ecological consequences(Matete and Hassan 2005). Moreover a steady decline in water tables (typically from 0.5 to 2m yr) has been taking place widely in semi-arid areas globally, mostly due to abstraction exceeding recharge, with consequences for both human requirements and ecosystems. Thus a major limiting factor is the need to identify whether the stored groundwater is a renewable or a non-renewable resource. In the case of deep basins such as the Saharan aquifers this water can be shown, from numerous studies, to be almost entirely non-renewable, 'fossil' water, recharged under wetter early Holocene or late Pleistocene climates, prior to onset of a more arid climate around 4500years BP (Edmunds etal 2004). Small amounts of modern recharge (for example in the Atlas Mountains or Tibesti) are insufficient to have an impact on the drawdown of distant well fields. It is critical, therefore, to base resource estimates for any development on knowledge of the locally renewable amounts from rainfall and to consider mining palaeo-reserves only as a last resort. Hydrogeological techniques are available to quantify modern recharge (Scanlon and Cook 2002, Scanlon etal 2006) and rates can vary widely according to rock type and landscape; reliance on modelled estimates alone could be misleading. Water quality is also a limiting factor in quantifying usable fresh groundwater storage. In addition to the regional or local problems caused by fluoride, in areas of East and West Africa (MacDonald etal2012), salinity, above all, will restrict the total usable storage for domestic use and food production, most notably in semi-arid or arid areas. Groundwater salinity arises from various sources, including lithologies containing evaporite minerals, residual sea water (especially in continental coastal margins) and evapotranspiration. As a general rule, salinity increases with depth (older waters tend to more saline), but an additional problem arises where salinity has built up due to aridification over several millennia. Playas and sebkhats are surface expressions of this salinity accumulation from surface water or groundwater discharge, but clearance of native vegetation also increases recharge and leads to salinity increase (George etal1997). Near-surface salt accumulation may be drawn down into cones of depression in areas of development. One of the largest artesian aquifers, the Continental Intercalaire of Algeria and Tunisia, has groundwater discharge with a salinity of 1-3gl-1, locally as high as 7gl-1 in the Tunisian Chotts (Edmunds etal 2003, Zammouri etal 2007), limiting water for irrigated agriculture. The volumes of non-saline and groundwater in the total storage therefore need to be considered as part of the storage.

AB  - Although there is increasing awareness of the importance of food legumes in human, animal and soil health, adoption of improved production technologies for food legume crops is not proceeding at the same pace as for cereal crops. Over the previous decade, the only food legumes to have shown significant production increases have been chickpea, lentil and faba bean in North America, chickpea in Australia, and faba bean in Europe. In smallholder farming in developing countries, production trends have mostly been static or have declined over the past decade despite the existence of technology that should permit higher and more stable yields. Ability to reverse negative trends is jeopardized by climate change as food legumes are mostly grown rainfed and are being exposed to increasingly variable and extreme weather. This review examines recent innovations in cultivation technology for the major food legumes-chickpea, lentil, dry pea, faba bean, lupin, common bean, mung bean, black gram, cowpea, and pigeonpea-and explores constraints to their adoption, particularly by resource-poor smallholder farmers. Conservation agriculture, involving minimum soil disturbance, maximum soil cover, and diverse rotations, has contributed to sustainable cropping system production in large-scale commercial farming systems in the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Turkey. Temperate food legumes have been incorporated into such systems. Adoption of conservation agriculture is only just beginning for smallholder farming in Asia and Africa, catalyzed by the development of low-cost implements suitable for minimum tillage. Water use efficiency improves with conservation agriculture as it allows for earlier planting, reduced soil evaporation, better weed management, and increased access to nutrients. Ecosystem-based approaches to plant nutrition are evolving which place more reliance on accessing organic and mineral reservoirs than in replenishing the immediately available pool with chemical fertilizers, leading to enhanced nutrient use efficiency of cropping systems. Ecosystem-based approaches are also being applied to management of weeds, diseases, and insect pests of food legumes, again with decreased reliance on synthetic chemicals. In achieving sustainable agricultural production systems, there is increasing realization of the need to move towards the tenets of organic agriculture, as exemplified in conservation agriculture and ecosystem-based approaches to plant nutrition and pest management. This does not necessarily imply a desire to qualify for organic product certification but more a realization of the need for sustainable agriculture. The movement towards conservation and organic agriculture encourages greater inclusion of food legumes, and legumes generally, in cropping systems. Unfortunately, however, technology transfer to resource-poor farming situations, where most food legumes are produced, remains a major bottleneck to meeting global demand. More participatory approaches to technology development, testing, and dissemination are required than hitherto practiced. It is suggested that this process could be enhanced by better focusing on major constraints within the value addition chain for food legumes. © INRA and Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.

AB  - Although agriculture has traditionally been primarily the concern of the world, it now plays an increasingly important role in how we meet challenges-international food security, environmental protection, climate change, energy supply, economic sustainability, and human health. With population growth and environmental deterioration, the attention about food security and sustainable agriculture is on the increase, and the status of ecological agriculture comes into prominence. Perennial grain crops would address many agricultural problems as well as substantial ecological and economic benefits, which can provide multiple ecosystem services essential for sustainable production more effectively than production systems based on annual crops, such as protecting against soil erosion, conserving water and nutrients, storing more carbon below ground, and building better pest tolerance. This paper presents some of advantages of perennial grain crops as a new option for the food security and ecoagriculture, as well as prospects the significant utilization of perennial crop on sustainability of agriculture and environment in the future. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - Wheat provides about 19% of the food calories and 21% of the protein to the world population. In 2008, the total wheat area grownwas about 224 million ha and with a harvest of 690 million t of grain.The Green Revolution in wheat production, spawned by the development of short-stature, photoperiod-insensitive, high yielding wheat cultivars with host plant resistance to rusts and other pathogens, was able to increase wheat productivity at a 3.6% annual rate in the 1960s and 1970s. However, yield growth in wheat slip to 2.8% from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, and to 1.1% since the mid-1990s. In the period leading up to 2020, demand for wheat for human consumption in developing countries is expected to grow at 1.6 % per annum, and for feed at 2.6 % per annum. The global average of wheat yield will have therefore to increase in the coming years at least to 3.5 t ha-1. This yield increase, essential to maintain global food security, requires a continuing supply of improved germplasm and appropriate agronomy in order to sustain enhanced productivity and preserve the natural resource base of the wheat farming. Global warming, as a result of climate change, may negatively affect wheat grain yields -potentially increasing food insecurity and poverty. Wheat breeders will depend on the croṕs genetic diversity and modern genetic enhancement methods (both genomics and transgenics) for improving wheat yield and its stability. They should conservewheat germplasm, study it, add value to it, and share it in enhanced form with clients worldwide. While changes in plant architecture (dwarfism and harvest index), photoperiod response and breeding for host plant resistance (especially for rusts) led to the productivity gains of the Green Revolution, adaptation to climate change (water and heat stresses, emerging pathogens and pests), efficient input use, food safety and quality, are additional global challenges to be tackled to fit newly bred-genotypes into sustainable and improved wheat farming in this 21st Century. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Twenty-two countries surround the Mediterranean Sea and a few more experience similar climate and soil conditions. The diversity of landscapes and natural conditions has created tremendous opportunities for economic development but has increased environmental concerns too. Human-induced pressures are on the rise throughout the region. They are particularly acute on the coastal areas. There are many competing interests especially for soil and water resources and the long term sustainable development of the region is far from being achieved. This paper offers a general overview and description of major soils of the Mediterranean region, explain their extent and characteristics and offer suggestions for their use and management. We argue that due to increased anthropic pressures throughout the region, but most importantly in North Africa and the Middle East, the endorsement of long-term policies for soil protection are not a choice but a prerogative to enhance sustainable development, reach food security objectives and meet the goals of poverty alleviation. It is concluded that unless there is political will to confront these realities chances for success may be limited and the region may continue to accelerate his path towards instability with consequences for all the countries in the region. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

AB  - African climate has been continuously changing throughout its geological history. Therefore, the article preliminary presents some important climate changes during the last 20,000 years, especially in the 20th century. The discussion focuses mainly on the impacts of predicted/expected climate changes in the coming decades, influencing food security, water availability, human health, biodiversity and other natural resources in Africa. Taking into account current socio-economic and demographic characteristics and trends, climate change is expected to exacerbate key development problems of the continent.

AB  - Introduction Protected areas (PAs) are well known to act as sources for food, fuel, clothing, and medicines. Unfortunately, as these resources diminish outside Pas, the pressure on them becomes more intense. For this reason, landscape approaches are required to protect and restore the ecosystem services of PAs. This is especially critical due to the fact that by 2025 over 60% of the world's "absolute" poor will live in rural areas, depending directly on the natural resources around them. There are many instances where PAs support local requirements while discouraging commercial interests of outside from rapidly depleting resources. PAs also directly contribute to increased resources - for example-in agriculture, through services such as pollination, or in fisheries through the creation of "no take" zones that allow fish stocks to recover. All over the world, PAs are established by governments, nongovernmental organizations and private entities with the aim of conserving biodiversity, and in most cases, without considering how PAs would affect the interested parties and their livelihoods. As a result, today PAs are seen as controversial tools for biodiversity conservation, since according to the mainstream narrative, they have caused the impoverishment of the local population through evictions and denial of access to natural resources. Taking this into account, the linkages between PAs and well-being of people living in or around them has therefore become a practical and ethical necessity. It is a practical necessity, because to survive and achieve their conservation objectives, protected areas need the support of local population and international community. It is an ethical necessity, because as it is widely recognized, conservation objectives cannot be pursued at the expenses of people's well-being. Protected areas such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries are physically shared by ecologically important flora and fauna, tourists, government officials, scientists and communities living in and around them. The benefits of protected areas extend to users at different scales, from local people who depend on particular species for their livelihood, to nations that depend on abundant freshwater and global community that depends on nature's capacity to regulate climate. Worldwide, many countries and regions, rich in biodiversity and poor in economy, have been vigorously promoting ecotourism as a conservation tool in their PAs since 1990s. PAs have played significant roles in tourist attraction in many countries since their establishment. Tourism can be an effective tool in the conservation and management of PAs. It can provide financial and political supports to conservation, and lead to a greater understanding of the value of PAs - which in turn can lead to more areas being protected. There is a wide range of opportunities for ecotourism in PAs. Such opportunities are revenue generation (i.e., user fees, entranced fees and donations), employment opportunities, and justification for protected areas, healthier economy, environmental education, and improved conservation efforts. In addition, Participatory development is consistence with planners in the direction of "with and for people" planning. Identifying what types of ecosystem services a protected area provides, who captures the benefits, what would happen if the services were lost, who would pay to replace them or who would suffer, is a good starting point. Material and methods: This study is based on a survey to study the importance of Ghale Shadab Prohibited Hunting Area (GSPHA), 30km north of Dezful in Khuzestan Province, from the perspective of stakeholders. This region (5000ha) was established as Prohibited Hunting Area in 2008. Maximum and minimum absolute temperatures are 28.5°c and -6.5°c, respectively, whereas average annual precipitation is about 474mm. typical large mammals include Ursus arctos, Panthera pardus, Capra aegagrus, Hyaena hyaena. Also, notable bird species include Alectoris chukar and Ammoperdix griseogularis. People living in or around GSPHA are mainly engaged in animal husbandry, agriculture, fishery and tourism. Findings revealed that 38% of visitors are unemployed. To collect data and information, a query was conducted in the study area. Stakeholder's survey was conducted to evaluate the importance of GSPHA. Stakeholders were divided in three groups including tourists, local communities and organizations. Also, three types of questionnaires were prepared. A total of 750 respondents were interviewed representing different socio-economic and occupational groups. The respondents were selected randomly to avoid serious bias. The aim of the survey was to gather information related to demography of stakeholders (e.g., age, education and occupation), willingness to environment and wildlife, sustainable use of environmental resources, willingness to participate in environmental conservation, study of problems in GSPHA, and tourism potential of the region. Descriptive statistics were derived to summarize the property of the dataset, while analytical methods (correlation and chi-squared test) were used to analyze the data and test their differences (at 95% level of significance). Analysis was conducted using SPSS ver. 11.5 and Excel. Results and Discussion: Establishment of PAs has been the most widely accepted means of biodiversity conservation so far, supported by national and international agencies. Most communities have developed their identity and cultural characteristics over time by devising and applying a strategy to cope with a given environment, and manage its natural resources. They possess a distinctive form of social organization, and their members share in varying degrees of political, economical, social and cultural characteristics (in particular language, behavioral norms, values, aspirations and often also health and disease patterns). They also function, or have functioned in the past, as micro-political bodies with specific capacities and authority. Findings showed that stakeholders use wide range of environmental resources in this region. Study findings showed that 61.5% of tourists, 78.7% of local communities and 92% of organization personnel were male and the rest were female. This study also showed that 66.5% of tourists, 16% of local communities and 64% of organization personnel had college educations. Findings revealed that 46.4% of tourists, 41.3% of local communities and 35% of organization personnel belonged to young groups between the ages of 20-30. 50.7% of local communities were farmers, husbandmen and fishermen. Furthermore, 38 % of these communities were unemployed. The results revealed that the tourists are varied by age, sex, education, culture and occupation. In general, the number of male visitors is higher than that of female visitors in outdoor recreation and youth groups are more interested in outdoor recreation. The visitors belonged to more than 21 provinces of Iran. High percentage of younger groups and visitors with college education indicates a high tourism potential of this region. The results also revealed that education can play a vital role in determining the demand for recreational activities at the GSPHA. Lake of Dez Dam, beautiful landscapes, rivers and springs beauty, wilderness region and wildlife, Shadab historical castle and living methods of local communities were important factors for tourist attraction. This finding corresponds with the opinion of Ceballos-Lascurain (1993) that green spaces with their landscapes, flora and fauna as well as their cultural elements form attractions for tourists. According to the visitors, the remarkable problems are insufficient toilets, accommodation problem, nonavailability of drinking water, and lack of proper communication facilities, lack of sufficient safety, security and guiding, lack of parking spaces for motor vehicle. Studies on people participation in outdoor recreation found that it revitalizes human spirit, restores people's initiatives of life, and produces feeling of well-being, satisfaction, creativeness and physical conditions. Government can create opportunities to develop the tourist industry based on natural resources and protected areas (ecotourism). Tourism as a tool for wildlife and wilderness areas conservation can be promoted, and from a community perspective it is expected to provide benefits that ultimately enhance local support for the conservation of natural resources. GSPHA's resources provide a wide range of products that are used for income and subsistence by the local communities. The majority of local communities (gt;70%) believed that their dependence to GSPHA is high and very high. Supplying the forage for livestock, outdoor recreation, water supply, exploitation of wild growing medicinal plants, firewood supply, food supply, handicrafts production and Exploitation of sand and gravel are the most important uses of indigenous communities in this area. An increasing number of studies show this type of correlation between household status and livelihood dependence on ecosystem goods and services, often sourced from protected areas. Estimates of the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services can provide powerful and much needed arguments to leverage additional protection for natural ecosystems which are important for development and poverty reduction. Unfortunately, economic planning has still largely failed to internalize the importance of protected areas for poverty reduction.

AB  - In countries with high human populations, using agricultural areas as multifunctional systems to produce food for humans and retain wildlife may be an efficient conservation strategy for many species. Inclusion of natural habitat and species requirements on agricultural landscapes explicitly into planning processes are precluded by lack of information on drivers of species persistence. Climate change is an additional emerging complexity, and adaptation plans for agricultural landscapes are biased towards intensification to secure long-range food production. I examine the conservation potential of an agricultural landscape in two districts of Uttar Pradesh, north India where agricultural intensification and altered rainfall patterns are predicted to occur. I assess stressors affecting breeding success over eight years of two large waterbirds of conservation concern - Sarus Cranes and Black-necked Storks. Both species had high breeding success that improved with total rainfall and more wetlands in breeding territories. Agricultural and township expansions deteriorated territory quality and reduced breeding success. Sarus Crane populations were predicted to decline relatively rapidly if development activities continued to displace breeding pairs. Black-necked Storks appeared resilient over the long-term notwithstanding reduced breeding success in low-rainfall years. Waterbird nesting habitats (wetlands and trees) were retained in Uttar Pradesh as community lands by villages and by state government via legal provisions suggesting the utility of multiple conservation approaches. Incorporating species requirements explicitly, alongside traditional land use practices conducive for habitat conservation, into adaptation planning and conservation policy will be necessary to retain long-term multifunctionality of such agricultural landscapes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article explores the drivers, benefits, and challenges to climate change adaptation in Bangladesh. It specifically investigates the "Community Based Adaptation to Climate Change through Coastal Afforestation Program," a 5-year $5 million adaptation scheme being funded and implemented in part by the Government of Bangladesh, United Nations Development Program, and Global Environment Facility. The article explores how the CBACC-CA builds various types of adaptive capacity in Bangladesh and the extent its design and implementation offers lessons for other adaptation programs around the world. The first part of the study begins by describing its research methods consisting of research interviews, site visits, and a literature review. It then summarizes six primary sectors vulnerable to climate change in Bangladesh: water resources and coastal zones, infrastructure and human settlements, agriculture and food security, forestry and biodiversity, fisheries, and human health. The article next describes the genesis and background behind the CBACC-CA, with an emphasis on components that promote capacity development, demonstration projects, risk reduction, and knowledge management. The article concludes that technology by itself is only a partial component of successful adaptation efforts, and that multiple and integrated adaptation measures that cut across sectors and social, institutional, and infrastructural dimensions are needed to truly build resilience and effectiveness. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Increasing population and consumption are placing unprecedented demands on agriculture and natural resources. Today, approximately a billion people are chronically malnourished while our agricultural systems are concurrently degrading land, water, biodiversity and climate on a global scale. To meet the world's future food security and sustainability needs, food production must grow substantially while, at the same time, agriculture's environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing ĝ€̃ yield gaps' on underperforming lands, increasing cropping efficiency, shifting diets and reducing waste. Together, these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Humans have doubled levels of reactive nitrogen in circulation, largely as a result of fertilizer application and fossil fuel burning. This massive alteration of the nitrogen cycle affects climate, food security, energy security, human health and ecosystem services. Our estimates show that nitrogen currently leads to a net-cooling effect on climate with very high uncertainty. The many complex warming and cooling interactions between nitrogen and climate need to be better assessed, taking also into account the other effects of nitrogen on human health, environment and ecosystem services. Through improved nitrogen management substantial reductions in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations could be generated, also allowing for other co-benefits, including improving human health and improved provision of ecosystem services, for example clean air and water, and biodiversity. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The article explains how the issue of Regional Development Dialogue (RDD), continuing from the Spring 2011 edition, is devoted to climate change and poverty. While the last issue focused on Africa, this issue discussed challenges and initiatives related to climate change and poverty in Asia. The discussion originated from the ITB-UNCRD Senior Policy Seminar on Climate Change and Poverty in Africa-Asia: Challenges and Initiatives held at the Bandung Institute of Technology on 3-4 August 2010. The GHG increase and warming trend has been the largest they have been able to discern in the history of the Earth. Climate change will have wide-ranging effects on the environment, and on socioeconomic and related sectors, including water resources, agriculture and food security, human health, terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity, and coastal zones. Warmer climates will also increase the spread of diseases such as malaria and make it more difficult for poor countries to respond adequately and quickly.

AB  - Providing food, energy and materials for the rising global population is a challenge which is compounded by increased pressure on natural resources such as land, water and fossil sources of raw materials. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities have increased with industrial development and population expansion, and it is anticipated that resulting climate change might further limit agricultural productivity, through changes to weather patterns and global availability/distribution of agriculturally productive land. Growing crops as feedstocks for industrial uses is seen as one way of reducing GHG emissions and dependency on fossil resources. However, determining the extent to which the development of crops for industrial use will effect GHG balances and provide for a more energy efficient manufacturing system requires the development and use of appropriate calculation methodologies.Research at the Porter Institute has identified over 250 different scenarios for bioenergy production systems using commodity crops. In order to rationalise this complexity and diversity, a modular approach to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and sustainability analysis has been taken. This allows characterisation of discrete sections of supply chains and enables comparisons to be made between different crop production systems, different process systems and different end product uses. The purposes of this paper are to introduce the concepts of biofuel GHG and sustainability metrics, to introduce the approach taken by our organization and to use the example of UK grown willow in a lignocellulosic ethanol production system to demonstrate how GHG emission outcomes can be reviewed for " new" crops and technologies.The results show a range of variation, in both growing and process systems and how outcomes such as energy and GHG balances can be affected by various activities.LCA methodologies provide data to inform governments and industry of the potential specific supply chains may have for energy and GHG saving. However, methodological approaches can also affect assessment outcomes. Unresolved issues in LCA methodology must also be evaluated e.g. impacts resulting from land use change. Sustainability assessments of crop growing systems, irrespective of the end use, also assist in the assessment of environmental impacts of supply chains. However, it is critical that data continue to be collected, analysed and reviewed, to ensure that the most appropriate crops are grown and processed for the most appropriate end use. © 2011.

AB  - Developing an efficient sustainable agriculture in the current context of the global major threats (climate change, soil degradation and erosion, water scarcity, biodiversity reducing), coupled with a continual population increasing, represents an imperative for conceiving a strategy that should integrate conventional and biotechnological approaches, aiming to optimize productivity and contribute to food, feed, fiber and fuel security. The successful developing and implementation of this strategy depend largely on establishing regional cooperation and a network that addresses to similar agricultural needs, priorities and practices, science based on regulations that should be able to protect public health and environment and to stimulate economic development, regional and global trade, modern agricultural practices, advanced food and feed production industry. The germs of such a regional cooperation and networking are developed by the Black Sea Biotechnology Association (BSBA), established in June 2004, as a public nonprofit organization that has proved to be a very promising example of cooperative achievements. This example deserves to be followed and extended on a large scale inside all Europe and even outside the continental limits. Very valuable information has been accumulated during fourteen years of genetic modified organisms (GMOs) cultivation (since 1996), continuously spreading in a number of 25 countries on different continents, under the dedicated management of International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Application (ISAAA), led by remarkable specialist dr. Clive James. The global impact of GMOs cultivation consists in higher level of productivity and economic benefits, as well as a considerable reduction of pesticide use, a decreasing of CO2 emission and soil, water and biodiversity preservation. The up-to-date evaluation of GMOs cultivation and use has not registered any negative effect on the human and animal health, the biodiversity, the consequences of the gene-flood to the conventional crops, the environmental resources. There are some strong reasons to join our efforts for promoting GMOs adoption in agricultural systems, without any further delay and to improve public perception of biotechnology achievements.

AB  - Drivers behind food security and crop protection issues are discussed in relation to food losses caused by pests. Pests globally consume food estimated to feed an additional one billion people. Key drivers include rapid human population increase, climate change, loss of beneficial on-farm biodiversity, reduction in per capita cropped land, water shortages, and EU pesticide withdrawals under policies relating to 91/414 EEC. IPM (Integrated Pest Management) will be compulsory for all EU agriculture by 2014 and is also being widely adopted globally. IPM offers a 'toolbox' of complementary crop-and region-specific crop protection solutions to address these rising pressures. IPM aims for more sustainable solutions by using complementary technologies. The applied research challenge now is to reduce selection pressure on single solution strategies, by creating additive/synergistic interactions between IPM components. IPM is compatible with organic, conventional, and GM cropping systems and is flexible, allowing regional fine-tuning. It reduces pests below economic thresholds utilizing key 'ecological services', particularly biocontrol. A recent global review demonstrates that IPM can reduce pesticide use and increase yields of most of the major crops studied. Landscape scale 'ecological engineering', together with genetic improvement of new crop varieties, will enhance the durability of pest-resistant cultivars (conventional and GM). IPM will also promote compatibility with semiochemicals, biopesticides, precision pest monitoring tools, and rapid diagnostics. These combined strategies are urgently needed and are best achieved via multi-disciplinary research, including complex spatio-temporal modelling at farm and landscape scales. Integrative and synergistic use of existing and new IPM technologies will help meet future food production needs more sustainably in developed and developing countries, in an era of reduced pesticide availability. Current IPM research gaps are identified and discussed. © 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - This review examines contributions of interdisciplinary (ID) research to understanding interactions between environmental quality, food production and food security. Global patterns of food insecurity and crop production are reviewed in relation to climate, land use and economic changes, as well as potential productivity increases compatible with environmental conservation. Interactions between food production and global processes make food insecurity a complex problem that requires ID analysis at local to global scales. Census and satellite data contribute to understanding of global cropland distribution. Analysis of land-use change exemplifies research between natural and social sciences. Quantitative modelling of global climate change impacts indicates relatively greater potential food insecurity in developing countries. International food security is increasingly interconnected through economic globalization and incentives for increased food production are required. Societies may not be able to expand available cropland without significant environmental risks; enhanced land and water productivity are the major opportunities available to increase food production. This requires renewed efforts in ID work to design and implement sound and efficient agricultural management practices. Models need to be informed by data from field experiments, long-term measurements and watershed monitoring by ground and remote sensing methods. Agricultural intensification may spare natural land but lead to increased pollution and water demand; reconciling conservation and productivity is a critical need. ID work provides many opportunities for synergies including conservation agriculture at the local level, efficient use of inputs, smarter land use taking into account spatial patterns and landscape ecology principles, and improved water management at field, system, watershed and basin levels. Goal-directed ID research is crucial, since producers, practitioners and policy makers should be involved. Geospatial, biotechnological and precision agriculture technologies linked with models can help inform strategies to achieve sustainable food production increases that maintain environmental quality. Implementation also requires ID work to overcome impediments due to human factors and facilitate adoption by farmers. © Copyright Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2011.

AB  - The significant impact on human and animal health from parasitic infections in tropical regions is well known, but parasites of medical and veterinary importance are also found in the Arctic. Subsistence hunting and inadequate food inspection can expose people of the Arctic to foodborne parasites. Parasitic infections can influence the health of wildlife populations and thereby food security. The low ecological diversity that characterizes the Arctic imparts vulnerability. In addition, parasitic invasions and altered transmission of endemic parasites are evident and anticipated to continue under current climate changes, manifesting as pathogen range expansion, host switching, and/or disease emergence or reduction. However, Arctic ecosystems can provide useful models for understanding climate-induced shifts in host-parasite ecology in other regions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is not enough water globally for all the things humans need and want water to do for us. Water supply bubbles are bursting in China, the Middle East and India with potentially serious implications for the global economy and for political stability. Even the United States is depleting groundwater on average 25% faster than it is being replenished. Our thirst for water grows with our population, but the amount of fresh water available on Earth is fixed. If we assume "business as usual" by 2050 about 40% of the projected global population of 9.4 billion is expected to be facing water stress or scarcity. With increasing climate variability being predicted by global climate models, we are likely also to have more people without adequate water more of the time, even in water-rich regions. Irrigation productivity rose dramatically over the past 40 years as a result of the Green Revolution. However, even if we disregard the environmental impacts caused by that revolution, we are no nearer to achieving global food security than we were 40 years ago, as every time we come close to filling the food production gap population growth and ecosystem decline associated with water diversions to human purposes set us back. Our natural and agricultural ecosystems are trying to tell us something. This book pursues these overarching themes connecting to water and food production at global and regional scales. The collection offers a comprehensive discussion of all relevant issues, and offers a wide-ranging discussion with the aim of contributing to the global debate about water and food crises. © 2011 Selection and editorial matter, The Regents of the University of California.

AB  - Riverine transport of organic carbon (OC) to the ocean is a significant component in the global carbon (C) cycle and the concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) in rivers and lakes is vital for ecosystem properties and water quality for human use. By use of a large dataset comprising chemical variables and detailed catchment information in 1000 Norwegian pristine lakes covering a wide climatic range, we were able to predict TOC concentrations with high accuracy. We further predict, using a 'space-for-time' approach and a downscaled, moderate, climate change scenario, that northern, boreal regions likely will experience strong increases in OC export from catchments to surface waters. Median concentrations of OC in these lakes will increase by 65%, from the current median of 2.0-3.3mgCL-1. This is a long-term effect, primarily mediated by increased terrestrial vegetation cover in response to climate change. This increase OC will have severe impacts on food-webs, productivity and human use. Given the robustness of the estimates and the general applicability of the parameters, we suggest that these findings would be relevant to boreal areas in general. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Factors such as growth in human and livestock populations, climate change, and the globalization of trade are creating favourable conditions for the emergence of new and more complex public health threats. One Health (sometimes referred to as One World One Health) is an approach that considers complex public health threats through an integrated lens of animal, human and ecosystem health. Within the last five years, the One Health approach has been gaining momentum in the international and national community. This paper will focus on human population growth, food and water security and climate change as three factors that have a major influence on the emergence or re-emergence of disease and highlight the importance of facilitating understanding, integration and collaboration between the different sectors. © 2011, © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Proper stewardship of the ocean is critical to the long-term vitality of the United States. The ocean, consisting of the open ocean, coasts, coastal watersheds, and Great Lakes, provides food and recreation, contributes to the nation's economic engine, is an element of national security, and is a major influence on the global climate system. Despite its vast extent, the ocean is finite and cannot indefinitely absorb all the stresses being placed on it; thus, the United States must commit to protecting the ocean through responsible stewardship and sensible management. Understanding society's impact on the ocean and the ocean's impact on society forms the basis for ensuring a clean, healthy, and stable ocean environment that can be responsibly used and enjoyed for generations to come. The goal of this document is to provide the guidance to build the scientific foundation to improve society's stewardship and use of, and interaction with, the ocean. Three central elements of science and technology will provide the United States with the knowledge and means to redefine its relationship with the ocean for the better. The capability to forecast key ocean and ocean-influenced processes and phenomena will change how society takes action in the future, much like weather forecasts do today. Developing the understanding and capability to forecast key processes related to hurricane and severe-storm formation, ocean currents, fish stocks, and human-health hazards, to name a few, will have significant economic, societal, and environmental benefits. Providing the scientific support for ecosystem-based management will allow resources to be managed in ways that account for the complex interactions between those resources and other parts of the marine environment, including humans. Deploying an ocean-observing system that can accurately describe the state of the ocean will revolutionize the access to and view of the ocean and increase the pace, efficiency, and scope of ocean research. In turn, this observing capability will enable ocean forecasting and ecosystem-based management. The focus on ocean forecasting, scientific support for ecosystem-based management, and ocean-observing capabilities was born out of a comprehensive community effort to define ocean research priorities for the United States for the next decade. Aspects of these three central elements are evident throughout the twenty (20) national ocean research priorities, oriented around the most compelling issues in key areas of interaction between society and the ocean (societal themes). These priorities, each with equal weight, focus on understanding critical ocean processes and interactions, and applying that understanding toward stewardship and responsible use of the ocean. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Throughout history, human societies have had to effectively devise ways and means to adapt to climate variability by altering their lifestyles, agriculture, settlements and other critical aspects of their economies and livelihoods. The capacity to adapt enables societies to deal with a range of uncertainties. Coping and adaptation is a way of life in Nigeria, where climate variability is the norm and where planting cycles in a largely rain-fed agricultural system are affected by reoccurring droughts, floods and other extreme weather events. Climate change scenarios for Nigeria suggest a warmer climate and projected changes in precipitation suggest it will be wetter in the south along the coast and drier in the northeast. The climate models also suggest more extreme heat events will occur. Resource dependent people, such as farmers, hunters and fishers, who depend directly on the productivity of natural resources around them for their livelihoods, are the first to be impacted by these changes in local environmental conditions. The Government of Nigeria is a signatory to the UNFCCC and there is an initiative underway to develop a national strategy for community-based climate change adaptation. Since 2007, the Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team (NEST) is an NGO has been implementing the project Building Nigeria’s Response to Climate Change (BNRCC). Pilot Projects are one component of BNRCC, and are designed to test adaptation options on a small scale in order to strengthen the resilience of communities to climate change, increase their adaptive capacity and provide recommendations based on lessons learned from community-based adaptation projects to the national strategy. The projects involve seven partner organizations who are working directly with 15 vulnerable communities spanning Nigeria from the Sahel in the north east to the Coastal/Rainforest in the south east. The projects include but are not restricted to: increasing food security by introducing improved crop varieties; testing alternative livelihood options such as aquaculture in order to provide a means of income and decrease reliance on dwindling forest resources; providing fuel efficient wood stoves; improving access to water sources to deal with water scarcity; and tree planting for ecosystem rehabilitation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

AB  - Agro-biodiversity is essential for global food production, livelihood security and sustainable agricultural development. Human communities worldwide have played a central role in shaping nature's diversity and its associated functions. Both natural processes and human activities have generated and sustained rich genetic, species and ecosystem diversity. Within agro-systems this agro-biodiversity performs many closely inter-related social, economical and environmental functions. 1) Promoting food and livelihood security. Dynamic and complex rural livelihoods usually rely on diverse plant and animal both in wild and in different stages of domestication. Different types of agro-biodiversity are used by different people at different times and in different places, hence contribute to livelihood strategies in a complex fashion. 2) Maintaining productive and environmental sustainability. In addition to contributing to environmental sustainability, agro-biodiversity helps sustain many production functions both in low input and high input agriculture. Available evidence is summarized for the following functions: soil organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, pollination, pest control, yield formation, soil and water conservation, impact on climate and water cycling, biodiversity conservation and influence on landscape structure. 3) Contribution on the resilience of rural economies. But this agro-biodiversity has been losing at an alarming rate. This paper identifies the dominating reasons for this loss and outlines the basic methods and mechanisms for the construction and restoration of field biodiversity. After the review of the negative effect of simplified agriculture in the fossil oil driven agriculture and the positive effect of "integrating human activity with nature" in traditional agriculture, the necessity and possibility of sustainable management of pests by biodiversity in agriculture is discussed, and the general methods used in construction and restoration of field biodiversity was summarized in ecosystem diversity, species diversity and genetic diversity levels. Based on the knowledge of plant pathology, agricultural ecology, plant nutrition science, plant physiology and other related disciplines, the basic principles for sustainable management on pests by agro-biodiversity was summarized into seven aspects, that is groups heterogeneity effect, dilution effect, field micro-environment effect, induced resistance effect, physical obstacle effect, physiological effect and allelopathic effect. It is well-known that fossil oil driven agriculture meets the needs of present generation by paying heavy cost from our future generations. Traditional agriculture has rich ecological philosophy behind, however it is hard to meet the ever-increasing needs of the society. More and more scientists, decision makers and producers are seeking for sustainable agricultural production systems with low input, high efficiency, and high diversity. Agro-biodiversity can improve important ecological functions. It is a golden key for the stable, healthy, productive and sustainable field ecosystem, and for the sustainable management of pests. For this purpose, we should pay our attention to four aspects: (1) the increase of interrelationship among different crop species; (2) the research on dominant pests and their natural enemies with their biological and ecological characteristics and their favorable environmental factors; (3) the discovery of production systems with comprehensive and sustainable management methods to control pests by using agro-biodiversity; (4) the development of integrated agronomic technology and agricultural machinery to match these agro-biodiversity models.

AB  - The Ramsar Convention was agreed in 1971 between 18 nations, and now has contracting parties from all regions of the world. The potential services related to ecosystem and human health primarily cover supply of water, food, nutrition, and medicine, purification of waste products, and buffering against adverse flooding and climate effects. The review shows that the Convention and the Ramsar network of important wetlands (currently 1500 sites of more than 100 million ha) is evidently playing a major role in relation to the provision of these services. However, examples are given showing that the benefits of wetland conservation for human and ecosystem health are often, due to lack of documentation, oversimplified. It is further shown that the Ramsar network in its current form and with the available data and documentation may be inefficient in providing the health services. This relates especially to the underrepresentation of several wetland types, the poor definition of boundaries, evidence of divergences between conservation and environmental protection targets in nutrient-limited coastal waters, assessments of tolerance threshold values for toxic substances for the various types of wetland communities, and the importance of the wetlands in the Ramsar network for groundwater and their flood buffering potential. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change (CC) has a number of immediate and long-term impacts on the fundamental determinants of human health. A number of potential human health effects have been associated either directly or indirectly with global climate change. Vulnerability to the risks associated with CC may exacerbate ongoing socio-economic challenges. The objective of this review was to analyse the potential risk and vulnerability in the context of climate-sensitive human diseases and health system in Tanzania. Climate sensitive vector- and water-borne diseases and other health related problems and the policies on climate adaptation in Tanzania during the past 50 years are reviewed. The review has shown that a number of climateassociated infectious disease epidemics have been reported in various areas of the country; mostly being associated with increase in precipitation and temperature. Although, there is no single policy document that specifically addresses issues of CC in the country, the National Environmental Management Act of 1997 recognizes the importance of CC and calls for the government to put up measures to address the phenomenon. A number of strategies and action plans related to CC are also in place. These include the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, the National Action Programme, and the National Bio-safety Framework. The government has put in place a National Climate Change Steering Committee and the National Climate Change Technical Committee to oversee and guide the implementation of CC activities in the country. Recognizing the adverse impacts of natural disasters and calamities, the government established a Disaster Management Division under the Prime Minister's Office. Epidemic Preparedness and Response Unit of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare is responsible for emergency preparedness, mostly disease outbreaks. However, specific climate changes associated with human health issues are poorly addressed in the MoHSW strategies and the national health research priorities. In conclusion, CC threatens to slow, halt or reverses the progress the country has made or is making to achieve its national and millennium development goals. It is therefore important that Tanzania prepares itself to appropriately address CC impact on human health. It is equally important that policy makers and other stakeholders are engaged in a process to update and adapt priorities, mobilize resources and build interdisciplinary research and implementation capacity on climate change and its mitigation.

AB  - This paper argues that a sustainable ecosystem management approach is vital to ensure the delivery of essential 'life support' ecosystem services and must be mainstreamed into societal conscience, political thinking and economic processes. Feeding the world at a time of climate change, environmental degradation, increasing human population and demand for finite resources requires sustainable ecosystem management and equitable governance. Ecosystem degradation undermines food production and the availability of clean water, hence threatening human health, livelihoods and ultimately societal stability. Degradation also increases the vulnerability of populations to the consequences of natural disasters and climate change impacts. With 10 million people dying from hunger each year, the linkages between ecosystems and food security are important to recognize. Though we all depend on ecosystems for our food and water, about seventy per cent of the estimated 1.1 billion people in poverty around the world live in rural areas and depend directly on the productivity of ecosystems for their livelihoods. Healthy ecosystems provide a diverse range of food sources and support entire agricultural systems, but their value to food security and sustainable livelihoods are often undervalued or ignored. There is an urgent need for increased financial investment for integrating ecosystem management with food security and poverty alleviation priorities. As the world's leaders worked towards a new international climate change agenda in Cancun, Mexico, 29 November-10 December 2010 (UNFCCC COP16), it was clear that without a deep and decisive post-2012 agreement and major concerted effort to reduce the food crisis, the Millennium Development Goals will not be attained. Political commitment at the highest level will be needed to raise the profile of ecosystems on the global food agenda. It is recommended that full recognition and promotion be given of the linkages between healthy, protected ecosystems and global food security; that sufficient resources be allocated for improved ecosystem valuation, protection, management and restoration; and that ecosystem management be integrated in climate change and food security portfolios. We will not be able to feed the world and eradicate extreme poverty, if we do not protect our valuable ecosystems and biodiversity. © 2011 by the authors.

AB  - Rangelands provide a diverse array of vital services that pertain to human life: food and fiber, clean drinking water, climate regulation, recreational experiences, wildlife habitat, and others. Ranchers and diverse publics have shared interests in these benefits, and ranchers have a financial interest in maintaining the long-term productivity of these landscapes. Ecosystem services are the benefits that people derive from nature that support and fulfill human life. Although livestock products are likely the most recognized ecosystem service provided by rangelands, healthy rangelands provide a wide array of ecosystem services. The value of payment projects focusing specifically on water quality was recently estimated to be $9.3 billion in 2008, and $50 billion cross all years that examined programs have been active. Third are biodiversity-focused payment programs, which provide payments to landowners for undertaking practices that result in the protection and enhancement of habitat and target species, including mitigation banks for protecting the habitat of endangered species.

AB  - This article presents a review of recent developments in studies assessing the global-scale impacts of climate change published since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Literature covering six main impact sectors is reviewed: sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal impacts, ocean acidification, ecosystems and biodiversity, water resources and desertification, agriculture and food security, and human health. The review focuses on studies with a global perspective to climate change impacts assessment, although in the absence of global studies for some sectors or aspects of impacts, national and regional studies are cited. The review highlights three major emerging themes which are of importance for the policy- and decision-making process: (1) a movement towards probabilistic methods of impacts assessment and/or the consideration of climate modelling uncertainty; (2) a move towards assessing potential impacts that could be avoided under different climate change mitigation scenarios relative to a business-as-usual reference scenario; and (3) uncertainties that remain in understanding the relationship between climate and natural or human systems. Whether recent impact assessments show a changed risk of damage to human or natural systems since the AR4 depends upon the impact sector; whether the assessments are robust or not (i.e. will stand the test of time) requires additional expert judgement. However, using this judgement, overall we find an increased risk to natural systems, and in some components of human systems. © The Author(s) 2011.

AB  - Important feature of any environmental strategy is that environmental objectives require action in several areas, which typically lie in the purview of different ministries. The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) has the important role of monitoring the development process and its environmental impact in a perspective of sustainable development and to devise suitable regulatory structures to achieve the desired results. While this role is crucial, environmental objectives can only be achieved if environmental concerns are internalized in policy making in a large number of sectors. This would require sharing of responsibility at all levels of government and across sectors with respect to monitoring of pollution, enforcement of regulations and development of programmes for mitigation and abatement. The Eleventh Five Year Plan of India has taken the due note of the concerns in terms of threat to food security due to degradation of land, forest and overexploitation of groundwater, lack of access of the community to basic services particularly energy, drinking water, sanitation facilities, low level of socio-economic development, high incident of unemployment, stagnant infant mortality and under-nourishment amongst children and the deterioration in quality of life. There is a pathoply of evidence to indicate that poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth is undetermined by degradation of soil, scarcity of freshwater, over-exploitation of costal ecosystems, loss of forest cover, biodiversity as genetic, species and ecosystem level, and long term change in the climate. The Eleventh Plan, therefore, marks a paradigm shift as it visualizes that economic growth alone is not the objective of national planning and the development objective not to be GDP of per capita income, and to promote grater participation of the community in the decision making process. The eleventh plan has indicated the monitorable targets as indicators of human development as well as the human welfare as the determinant factor of the development strategy. The study of provisions regarding protection of the environment in XI th Five Year Plan reveals that definitely some attempts will be made in Indian economy to protect the environment. But it seems those are not adequate. Some additional provisions and efforts are necessary. This plan does not much talk on the problem of air pollution and noise pollution, which are very much important in urban areas and have very bad consequences. The plan also does not consider what can be role of the private, cooperative sectors and NGOs in the protection of the environment. Likewise, what responsibility a city in our country is expected to discharge concerning environment protection. The plan also lacks in providing for the problems of climate change and global warming.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore how Andean knowledge and culture have shaped mountain ecosystems by building cultural landscapes where agrobiodiversity is created and recreated, water is domesticated (seeded and harvested), and where a harmonious relationship with the Earth and the Universe is kept. Design/methodology/approach: Through the use of primary and secondary sources, the information is then organized detailing a synthesis of thoughts and joint research studies conducted by various authors regarding the valuable contributions made by the Andean culture. Findings: This paper finds that strategies for facing the ecological crisis affecting planet Earth are being developed: the Pleiades and the Andean Cross continue to be observed in order to predict the weather and climate and make decisions related to traditional agricultural systems; cultural landscapes are being created and maintained; and water continues to be domesticated. Originality/value: The tropical Andes of Peru would be in the third country most affected by global climate change worldwide. The severe impacts of the global phenomenon on mountain ecosystems and cultural landscapes are many, all of which are affecting food security of large human groups and traditional lifestyles of communities and farmers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Analyses of sedimentary evidence in the form of spores, pollen, freshwater algae, dinoflagellate cysts, phytoliths and charcoal from AMS 14C-dated, Holocene-aged sequences provide an excellent opportunity to examine the responses of Neolithic agriculturalists in the lower Yangtze to changing environments. Evidence from two sites close to the southern margin of the Yangtze delta and separated by what is now Hangzhou Bay attests the critical importance to early attempts at food production of access to freshwater resources. More readily, if episodically, available freshwater resources during the early to mid-Holocene on the Hangjiahu plain may have encouraged an early reliance on rice-based agriculture, which in turn facilitated the accumulation of agricultural surpluses and cultural diversification. Cultural change was relatively attenuated and human population pressures possibly lower on the Ningshao plain, seemingly because of much more profound environmental impacts of variations in local hydrological conditions, and because predominantly saline conditions, associated with rising relative sea level, hampered the early development of irrigated agriculture. The evidence, although largely dating to the early and middle parts of the Holocene, provides a timely warning of the complexity of vulnerability to climate change-induced processes of agriculture, and indeed human activities more generally, on megadeltas in Asia. © 2010 University of Washington.

AB  - The Bering Sea is one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the world, sustaining nearly half of U.S. annual commercial fish catches and providing food and cultural value to thousands of coastal and island residents. Fish and crab are abundant in the Bering Sea; whales, seals, and seabirds migrate there every year. In winter, the topography, latitude, atmosphere, and ocean circulation combine to produce a sea ice advance in the Bering Sea unmatched elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, and in spring the retreating ice; longer daylight hours; and nutrient-rich, deep-ocean waters forced up onto the broad continental shelf result in intense marine productivity (Figure 1). This seasonal ice cover is a major driver of Bering Sea ecology, making this ecosystem particularly sensitive to changes in climate. Predicted changes in ice cover in the coming decades have intensified concern about the future of this economically and culturally important region. In response, the North Pacific Research Board (NPRB) and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) entered into a partnership in 2007 to support the Bering Sea Project, a comprehensive $52 million investigation to understand how climate change is affecting the Bering Sea ecosystem, ranging from lower trophic levels (e.g., plankton) to fish, seabirds, marine mammals, and, ultimately, humans. The project integrates two research programs, the NSF Bering Ecosystem Study (BEST) and the NPRB Bering Sea Integrated Ecosystem Research Program (BSIERP), with substantial in-kind contributions from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

AB  - Climate change is a global phenomenon that is being experienced by all levels of society, regardless of race and species, and in all types of ecosystems, regardless of geographic location. It will have diverse effects on biodiversity which will directly impact on food security, water supply, and livelihood among others, especially for the poor and more vulnerable sectors of human society. More importantly, all forms of life including human society are trying their best to adapt and survive. This book explores the two-way link between climate change and the state of biodiversity in Southeast Asia. By drawing on the experiences and lessons shared by representatives from research and development agencies, academic institutions, donors, and other organizations; and the crosscutting issues contributed by experts, this book aims to provide insights, lessons, and perspectives on how Southeast Asia is dealing with these twin concerns. This book is invaluable to all who are interested in assessing research gaps, identifying future research areas, drafting effective policy agenda, and implementing critical activities at the community, national, and international levels. © 2010 Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore.

AB  - Healthy and tasty nutrition in sufficient quantities is a basic human need. The ways in which we eat and drink are part of human culture. At the same time, the production of food is closely linked with the natural environment and ecological cycles, demonstrating our dependence on nature. Altogether, food production and consumption form a complex system that is an integral part of our daily life. Agriculture and food production are integrated into a multi-level system of markets, flows and actor networks. On a global scale, they have changed considerably over the last 50 years. Agricultural production and yields have been increasing due to the expansion of arable and irrigated land and the intensification, even industrialisation, of farming. International competition demands low prices, large volumes, standardisation, specialisation and high production efficiency from agricultural systems (Morgan et al. 2006). The globalisation of food markets has intensified long distance trade, resulting in complex commodity-flow and division of labour systems (cf. the shrimp industry, Chapter 7 in this volume). As a consequence of these developments, many countries have increased their food security. In industrialised countries especially, an outstanding variety of food is available at low prices. On the other hand, agricultural intensification causes overexploitation and negative effects, such as soil degradation, water pollution, loss of biodiversity, climate change, and reduced standards of animal welfare (Knudsen et al. 2006). In 2009, about one billion people, mainly in developing countries, suffer from malnutrition, whereas in richer social sectors over-consumption and unhealthy diets are contributing to an increase of endemic illnesses, such as obesity or cardiovascular diseases. Food production and consumption are being exposed to structural changes, but these are not necessarily sustainable. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Extraordinary demands are being placed on agricultural systems to produce food, fiber and energy. Biomass burning and the removal of crop residues reduce carbon in soil and vegetation, which has implications for soil fertility and the global carbon cycle. Pyrolysis of waste biomass generates fuels and biochar (charcoal) recalcitrant against decomposition. The process of pyrolysis or carbonization is known globally. It can be implemented on a small scale (e.g., cooking stove) as well as a large scale (e.g., biorefinery) and in most agricultural systems. Biochar offers unique options to address issues emerging from the conflicts and complementarities between cultivating crops for different purposes, such as for energy or for CO2 sequestration or for food and the impacts on food security, soil degradation, water, and biodiversity. Biochar is proposed as a soil amendment in environments with low carbon sequestration capacity and previously carbon-depleted soils (especially in the Tropics). From recent studies it is known that biochar amendments to soil increase and maintain fertility and the human-made Terra Preta soils in the Amazon prove that infertile soils can be transformed into fertile soils and long-term SOC enrichment is feasible even in environments with low carbon sequestration capacity. The prospects are to increase the sustainability of land use, establish a large carbon sink, reducing the rate of deforestation and competition between different land use purposes through waste biomass utilization. This chapter reviews the potential of waste biomass utilizations, the importance of the soil organic carbon pool for climate and explains our options to manage this carbon pool by biochar carbon sequestration. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Baiyangdian, located in Hebei province, is the biggest freshwater lake in North China. Since the 1960s, due to increasing human activities and climate change, this area has suffered from markedly shrinking and drying up several times. In current situation, anthropogenic water supplement plays a very important role in maintain this wetland's existence and development, and from 1981 to 2003 this approach had been already carried out 15 times. But until now there is few study in the aspect of whole ecosystem level responded to anthropogenic water supplement. In this study we used Ecopath model to analyze the changes of ecosystem's structure and function in connecting with once water supplement event which started in middle September 2009. Based on field experimental data in September and October 2009, two mass-balance models of the Baiyangdian Lake were developed to compare differences in energy flow process, trophic composition and other system character indexes during this two periods. As the results show, from September to October, the biomass proportion of first trophic level distinctively increased but in higher trophic level this proportion declined, meanwhile the total primary productivity/total respiration (TPP/R) increased by 12.07%, the system omnivorous coefficient (SOI), Finn's cycling index (FCI), and the average path length decreased by 4.16%, 20.13%, and 23.4% respectively. Most of the change directions of the indexes are contrary to the natural processes of ecosystem development, which meant that the interactions of organics are weakened, system maturity is degraded further and the ecosystem became more vulnerable to external disturbance after this time of anthropogenic water compensation. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Climate change is accelerating and is already affecting marine ecosystems and their services. Coupled climate models and marine observation indicate that the world marine is warming and patterns in atmospheric variability are changing, resulting in changes in marine stratification, circulation patterns, sea ice and light supply to the surface marine. Biological responses to these effects are visible but uncertain. The diversity and productivity of marine ecosystems are extremely important in preserving the health of the marine and terrestrial environment, and provides important sources of food for humans and animals, for the pharmaceutical industry, medicine, as well as for additives in the food industry and cosmetics, etc. The importance of the macrobenthic flora - algae and phanerogames - for the general productivity of the marine environment, especially in shallow waters, is becoming more and more obvious from the biological, as well as from the economical point of view. The macrophytes also represent a particular life form in aquatic wather. During the past years, it became obvious that the ecosystem marin presents a marine algae exceedence, which should be turned valuable in one way or another. Marine algae are a heterogenic group of organisms that is comprised of aprox. 10 000 species, spread especially in the aquatic environment but also on the solid wet substratum. The characterisation of the coastal sea water system with physical and chemical indicators, contamination indicators, and eutrophication indicators based on analytical chemical data was made in the paper. The characterisation of marine algae was presented for all the algae analysed.

AB  - The eastern Mediterranean faces a severe water crisis: water supply decreases due to climate change, while demand increases due to rapid population growth. The GLOWA Jordan River project generates science-based management strategies for maximizing water productivity under global climate change. We use a novel definition of water productivity as the full range of services provided by landscapes per unit blue (surface) and green (in plants and soil) water. Our combined results from climatological, ecological, economic and hydrological studies suggest that, in Israel, certain landscapes provide high returns as ecosystem services for little input of additional blue water. Specifically, cultural services such as recreation may by far exceed that of food production. Interestingly, some highly valued landscapes (e.g. rangeland) appear resistant to climate change, making them an ideal candidate for adaptive land management. Vice versa, expanding irrigated agriculture is unlikely to be sustainable under global climate change. We advocate the inclusion of a large range of ecosystem services into integrated land and water resources management. The focus on cultural services and integration of irrigation demand will lead to entirely different but productive water and land allocation schemes that may be suitable for withstanding the problems caused by climate change. © 2010 The Royal Society.

AB  - The objective of this study is to assess the variation of pollution in the Thai-Laos Mekong associated with seasonal dynamics concomitant with the natural geological features and human activities that impact on the adverse quality of the river. The complex ecology of the 1500 km stretch of the Thai-LaosMekong River has been studied in this paper to understand the relationship with the geomorphology, with the sub-tropical monsoonal climate and the impact of human activity. Sub-surface geology controls the nature and extent of the drainage basin and of the river channel. The volume flow of the river varies naturally and dynamically in phase with the rainfall; traditional models based on steady state hydraulics are inappropriate. Continuous erosion of the river banks and bed generates a sediment load of impure silt, mica, quartz and clay minerals that inhibits light penetration and limits the primary productivity of the river. The river separates two countries at different stages of development; it flows through or close to eight non-industrial conurbations (Populations 350,000-2,000,000) but is otherwise sparsely populated. The river is used for subsistence agriculture, village transport, fishing including aquaculture and as a source of domestic water. Hydroelectricity is generated from the Laos tributaries. The river is a depository for partially treated urban waste and untreated village waste, hence populations of E.coli bacteria sometimes render the water unsuitable for drinking unless treated with the highest value of 240/100ml found at station 7 during the summer season of 2003. Furthermore the river is polluted by trace metals, notably cadmium and mercury, and by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are particularly concentrated in the sediments. Previous work has shown that cadmium and mercury exceed the Probable Effect Level (PEL) values of Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines and that the PAH concentrations were also greater than the Interim Sediment Quality Guidelines (ISQG). Consequently the fish stock, a vital source of protein for the local human population maybe seriously affected. As conflict between the demands of human activities will be exacerbated by the continuing development of the basin; monitoring must be continued and a better model of the river's ecology is needed to predict the impact of development.

AB  - Aim As the demands for food, feed and fuel increase in coming decades, society will be pressed to increase agricultural production - whether by increasing yields on already cultivated lands or by cultivating currently natural areas - or to change current crop consumption patterns. In this analysis, we consider where yields might be increased on existing croplands, and how crop yields are constrained by biophysical (e.g. climate) versus management factors.Location This study was conducted at the global scale.Methods Using spatial datasets, we compare yield patterns for the 18 most dominant crops within regions of similar climate. We use this comparison to evaluate the potential yield obtainable for each crop in different climates around the world. We then compare the actual yields currently being achieved for each crop with their 'climatic potential yield' to estimate the 'yield gap'.Results We present spatial datasets of both the climatic potential yields and yield gap patterns for 18 crops around the year 2000. These datasets depict the regions of the world that meet their climatic potential, and highlight places where yields might potentially be raised. Most often, low yield gaps are concentrated in developed countries or in regions with relatively high-input agriculture.Main conclusions While biophysical factors like climate are key drivers of global crop yield patterns, controlling for them demonstrates that there are still considerable ranges in yields attributable to other factors, like land management practices. With conventional practices, bringing crop yields up to their climatic potential would probably require more chemical, nutrient and water inputs. These intensive land management practices can adversely affect ecosystem goods and services, and in turn human welfare. Until society develops more sustainable high-yielding cropping practices, the trade-offs between increased crop productivity and social and ecological factors need to be made explicit when future food scenarios are formulated. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - True sustainability demands that we seek to more than 'prop up' traditional approaches to our environment; rather, it requires that we redress current shortcomings in the planning and design of our urban environment at both bio-regional and local scales. Nourishing Urbanism proposes a shift in the urban and non-urban paradigm relating to energy, water and food; all face significant climate-related challenges - and are united by land-use policy, planning and design. We need a renewed planning and design framework for cities and regions that allows the retrofitting of today's urbanity, and prepares our cities for a new tomorrow. Nourishing Urbanism seeks to provide a malleable planning and design framework that embraces the symbiosis between urban and non-urban, and provides for the well-being of the human condition through recommending policies and technical solutions that readdress land use, ultimately impacting the security of our energy, water and soil resources, as well as infrastructure, food supply, health and design. © 2010 Earthscan.

AB  - In this article, we consider the potential effects of anthropogenic disturbances on marine fish species known or suspected to be habitat engineers. The three species of interest inhabit different marine habitats at different life stages, and therefore can have significant influences across the sea floor at broad spatial scales. The primary species include the shallow-water Atlantic goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara), which inhabits mangrove root systems as juveniles, and caves, shipwrecks, and rocky reefs as adults; red grouper (E. morio), which excavates habitat throughout its benthic life in Karst regions of the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic, from the coast to the shelf-edge; and tilefish (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps), a species that lives on the continental slope and constructs elaborate, pueblo-esque burrows. The anthropogenic disturbances of greatest interest in the Gulf of Mexico include fishing, hypoxia, red tide, oil and gas exploration, and climatic change. We suggest that to understand the broader effects of both natural and anthropogenic disturbances on biomass and productivity in these species requires that we first understand the strength of interactions between them and the other species residing within their communities (e.g., predators, prey, commensals, and mutualists). © The Author 2010.

AB  - The development and survival or disappearance of civilizations has been based on the performance of soils to provide food, fibre, and further essential goods for humans. Amongst soil functions, the capacity to produce plant biomass (productivity function) remains essential. This function is closely associated with the main global issues of the 21st century like food security, demands of energy and water, carbon balance and climate change. A standardised methodology for assessing the productivity function of the global soil resource consistently over different spatial scales will be demanded by a growing international community of land users and stakeholders for achieving high soil productivity in the context of sustainable multifunctional use of soils. We analysed available methods for assessing the soil productivity function. The aim was to find potentials, deficiencies and gaps in knowledge of current approaches towards a global reference framework. Our main findings were (i) that the soil moisture and thermal regime, which are climate-influenced, are the main constraints to the soil productivity potential on a global scale, and (ii) that most taxonomic soil classification systems including the World Reference Basis for Soil Resources provide little information on soil functionality in particular the productivity function. We found (iii) a multitude of approaches developed at the national and local scale in the last century for assessing mainly specific aspects of potential soil and land productivity. Their soil data inputs differ, evaluation ratings are not transferable and thus not applicable in international and global studies. At an international level or global scale, methods like agro-ecological zoning or ecosystem and crop modelling provide assessments of land productivity but contain little soil information. Those methods are not intended for field scale application to detect main soil constraints and thereby to derive soil management and conservation recommendations in situ. We found also, that (iv) soil structure is a crucial criterion of agricultural soil quality and methods of visual soil assessment like the Peerlkamp scheme, the French method "Le profil cultural" and the New Zealand Visual Soil Assessment are powerful tools for recognising dynamic agricultural soil quality and controlling soil management processes at field scale. We concluded that these approaches have potential to be integrated into an internationally applicable assessment framework of the soil's productivity function, working from field scale to the global level. This framework needs to serve as a reference base for ranking soil productivity potentials on a global scale and as an operational tool for controlling further soil degradation and desertification. Methods like the multi-indicator-based Muencheberg Soil Quality Rating meet most criteria of such a framework. This method has potential to act as a global overall assessment method of the soil productivity function for cropping land and pastoral grassland but needs further evolution by testing and amending its indicator thresholds. © 2010 INRA, EDP Sciences.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are centrally important to the biology of the planet, yet a comprehensive understanding of how anthropogenic climate change is affecting them has been poorly developed. Recent studies indicate that rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations are driving ocean systems toward conditions not seen for millions of years, with an associated risk of fundamental and irreversible ecological transformation. The impacts of anthropogenic climate change so far include decreased ocean productivity, altered food web dynamics, reduced abundance of habitat-forming species, shifting species distributions, and a greater incidence of disease. Although there is considerable uncertainty about the spatial and temporal details, climate change is clearly and fundamentally altering ocean ecosystems. Further change will continue to create enormous challenges and costs for societies worldwide, particularly those in developing countries.

AB  - Humanity has entered a new phase of sustainability challenges, the Anthropocene, in which human development has reached a scale where it affects vital planetary processes. Under the pressure from a quadruple squeeze-from population and development pressures, the anthropogenic climate crisis, the anthropogenic ecosystem crisis, and the risk of deleterious tipping points in the Earth system-the degrees of freedom for sustainable human exploitation of planet Earth are severely restrained. It is in this reality that a new green revolution in world food production needs to occur, to attain food security and human development over the coming decades. Global freshwater resources are, and will increasingly be, a fundamental limiting factor in feeding the world. Current water vulnerabilities in the regions in most need of large agricultural productivity improvements are projected to increase under the pressure from global environmental change. The sustainability challenge for world agriculture has to be set within the new global sustainability context. We present new proposed sustainability criteria for world agriculture, where world food production systems are transformed in order to allow humanity to stay within the safe operating space of planetary boundaries. In order to secure global resilience and thereby raise the chances of planet Earth to remain in the current desired state, conducive for human development on the long-term, these planetary boundaries need to be respected. This calls for a triply green revolution, which not only more than doubles food production in many regions of the world, but which also is environmentally sustainable, and invests in the untapped opportunities to use green water in rainfed agriculture as a key source of future productivity enhancement. To achieve such a global transformation of agriculture, there is a need for more innovative options for water interventions at the landscape scale, accounting for both green and blue water, as well as a new focus on cross-scale interactions, feed-backs and risks for unwanted regime shifts in the agro-ecological landscape. © 2010 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The burden of diseases caused by food-borne pathogens remains largely unknown. Importantly data indicating trends in food-borne infectious intestinal disease is limited to a few industrialised countries, and even fewer pathogens. It has been predicted that the importance of diarrhoeal disease, mainly due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death will decline worldwide. Evidence for such a downward trend is limited. This prediction presumes that improvements in the production and retail of microbiologically safe food will be sustained in the developed world and, moreover, will be rolled out to those countries of the developing world increasingly producing food for a global market. In this review evidence is presented to indicate that the microbiological safety of food remains a dynamic situation heavily influenced by multiple factors along the food chain from farm to fork. Sustaining food safety standards will depend on constant vigilance maintained by monitoring and surveillance but, with the rising importance of other food-related issues, such as food security, obesity and climate change, competition for resources in the future to enable this may be fierce. In addition the pathogen populations relevant to food safety are not static. Food is an excellent vehicle by which many pathogens (bacteria, viruses/prions and parasites) can reach an appropriate colonisation site in a new host. Although food production practices change, the well-recognised food-borne pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli, seem able to evolve to exploit novel opportunities, for example fresh produce, and even generate new public health challenges, for example antimicrobial resistance. In addition, previously unknown food-borne pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, are constantly emerging. Current understanding of the trends in food-borne diseases for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens has been reviewed. The bacterial pathogens are exemplified by those well-recognized by policy makers; i.e. Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Antimicrobial resistance in several bacterial food-borne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and Vibrio spp., methicillin resistant Staphylcoccus aureas, E. coli and Enterococci) has been discussed as a separate topic because of its relative importance to policy issues. Awareness and surveillance of viral food-borne pathogens is generally poor but emphasis is placed on Norovirus, Hepatitis A, rotaviruses and newly emerging viruses such as SARS. Many food-borne parasitic pathogens are known (for example Ascaris, Cryptosporidia and Trichinella) but few of these are effectively monitored in foods, livestock and wildlife and their epidemiology through the food-chain is poorly understood. The lessons learned and future challenges in each topic are debated. It is clear that one overall challenge is the generation and maintenance of constructive dialogue and collaboration between public health, veterinary and food safety experts, bringing together multidisciplinary skills and multi-pathogen expertise. Such collaboration is essential to monitor changing trends in the well-recognised diseases and detect emerging pathogens. It will also be necessary understand the multiple interactions these pathogens have with their environments during transmission along the food chain in order to develop effective prevention and control strategies. © 2010.

AB  - Chemical ecology provides unique perspectives for managing plant/human interactions to achieve food security. Allelochemicals function as chemical defences of crop plants, enhancing yields. While ingested allelochemicals can confer health benefits to humans, at higher concentrations they are often toxic. The delicate balance between their positive and negative effects in crop plants is influenced by many factors. Some of these-how environment affects optimal levels of defence, how metabolic interactions with nutrients affect toxicity of ingested allelochemicals-are the province of chemical ecology. These biological factors, however, interact with social factors, and neither can be studied independently. Chemical ecologists must work together with social scientists to understand the overall system. Here, we illustrate such an integrative approach, analysing the interactions between people and the major tropical crop manioc, which contains cyanogenic glucosides. Polymorphism for cyanogen levels in manioc facilitates analysis of how costs and benefits of crop defences vary among social systems. We first show how people/manioc interactions diversified in this crop's Amazonian homeland, then turn to the remarkable cultural adaptations of African farmers since manioc's introduction 400 years ago. Finally, we evaluate new coevolutionary challenges in parts of Africa where people are still unfamiliar with a potentially dangerous crop. Current environmental and social catastrophes have restricted farmers' options, resulting in acute problems in health of humans and ecosystems. We show that high cyanogen levels confer important agronomic advantages, but also impose costs and constraints that can only be understood when biology is coupled with analysis of social, cultural and economic factors. Detoxifying manioc technologically requires know-how, time, water and other resources. Detoxifying residual dietary cyanogens metabolically depends on being able to grow, or to buy, the nutrients required for detoxification, primarily sulphur-rich proteins. Solutions that appear adaptive today may not be in the future, as changing climate, rising atmospheric CO2 levels and decreased access to fertilizers affect productivity of crops and the nutrient and allelochemical composition of the foods they are used to produce. © 2010 Springer Basel AG.

AB  - In this chapter, Cagan H. Sekercioglu recapitulates natural ecosystem functions and services. Ecosystem services are the set of ecosystem functions that are useful to humans. These services make the planet inhabitable by supplying and purifying the air we breathe and the water we drink. Water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur are the major global biogeochemical cycles. Disruptions of these cycles can lead to floods, droughts, climate change, pollution, acid rain, and many other environmental problems. Soils provide critical ecosystem services, especially for sustaining ecosystems and growing food crops, but soil erosion and degradation are serious problems worldwide. Higher biodiversity usually increases ecosystem efficiency and productivity, stabilizes overall ecosystem functioning, and makes ecosystems more resistant to perturbations. Mobile linked animal species provide critical ecosystem functions and increase ecosystem resilience by connecting habitats and ecosystems through their movements. Their services include pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient deposition, pest control, and scavenging. Thousands of species that are the components of ecosystems harbor unique chemicals and pharmaceuticals that can save people's lives, but traditional knowledge of medicinal plants is disappearing and many potentially valuable species are threatened with extinction. Increasing habitat loss, climate change, settlement of wild areas, and wildlife consumption facilitate the transition of diseases of animals to humans, and other ecosystem alterations are increasing the prevalence of other diseases. Valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs helps integrate these services into public decision-making and can ensure the continuity of ecosystems that provide the services. © Oxford University Press, 2013.

AB  - The increased public and political focus on global warming has diverted discussion away from world resource depletion, particularly the depletion of fossil fuel energy with its potentially disastrous impact on world food production. According to its own internal whistleblowers, the International Energy Agency appears to have falsified information on world fossil fuel depletion-- on the grounds that telling the truth that world energy resources may already have peaked in production and are exceeded by demand, could cause skyrocketing oil prices and stampede the world into a new recession. Depletion of finite resources such as oil, gas, useable water or minerals is likely to impact on world GDP well before the worst impacts of global warming. The two together are likely to constrain world food production seriously, particularly in countries with high population densities or insufficient fertile lands. Food security in these countries is behind the huge "land and water grab" by foreign nationals that is now occurring across the developing world. Worldwide, governments have dealt with the recession by increasing consumption to prevent job losses which has increased demand for scarce resources, in order to return countries to growth (or business as normal). If peak oil has already arrived or is imminent, providing public funds to already damaged businesses that have large carbon footprints, is clearly irrational. Historically, global economic growth has never occurred without a simultaneous increase in the use of fossil fuel energy; GDP growth and world oil production growth have tracked each other for decades. It seems that while the IEA expects a steady increase in available oil, recent, more believable, evaluations of the decline in oil from the major giant oil fields that are already in the phase of depletion (e.g. Cantarell in Mexico and the North Sea province etc) suggests that Peak Oil arrived in 2008 and that by 2030 the production from fields currently on stream could have decreased by over 50 per cent (Hook 2009).The probable effect will be high prices flowing on into every walk of life, especially the cost of food with its huge embedded fossil fuel energy costs. This will inevitably increase financial instability and produce more recessions. Although global warming is probably the greatest problem humanity has ever faced the most immediate issue is the finite nature of fossil fuel that has supported the presently high standard of living (in industrialized countries). Without cheap oil there is no cheap food. There is no cheap water, health care, travel, housing or recreation. Without cheap energy the world contracts to using local resources and local activities. As food availability and diversity declines, it may lead to a decrease in the human population. This is contrary to the forecasted increase from 6.7 to over 8 billion people in the next 20 years. Human population increase is often considered the major problem that will impact on both resource depletion and global warming but consumerism by the wealthy is presently of major concern The carbon footprint of multi millionaires can be up to ten thousand times that of the average person in industrialised countries, which in turn is 10 times that of the average person in developing countries and many of the 1 billion subsistence farmers in the world have almost insignificant use of fossil energy. There are around 10 million people world wide with assets greater then a million dollars and therefore have disproportionate effect on world resource depletion and global warming. No politicians appear to be willing to address the problem of resource depletion and yet people are the end users and will be greatly affected as demand exceeds production for many resources, from rare earth metals through to energy and water. Politicians and business entrepreneurs appear to be willing to ignore the dangerous outlook for future generations, being only concerned with their present wealth, health and living standards and no politician wants to be the one telling their electorate that The free market economy and globalization must be severely constrained. Living standards or expectations of, in particular the rich, must be reduced-consume less, shop less, live in smaller homes, grow food locally, recreate locally and give up extravagant travel modes and also non essential travel and so on More and more people will have to cross the line from simply exercising brain power to make a living, to exercising imaginative and also efficient use of muscle power from animals and themselves to generate food. For the sake of peace and equity it will also be essential to lift the standard of living of the poor and mandate birth control in all countries if the floods of refugees that could occur through resource depletion and global warming, are to be prevented. Cuts in their use of fossil fuels should be forced first on the super rich who should pay a high price to pollute the global atmosphere at the cost of burning of fossil fuels (e.g. flying or owning private jets, large ocean cruisers, multiple cars and mansions and so on) However it is essential that everybody, above a minimum standard of living, must make some sacrifice. Few of us are going to do it voluntarily as it means giving up too much of our lifestyles for it to be effective in curbing greenhouse gases to a 'safe' level. The world needs time to adjust to even the first decade of the second half of the age of oil The objectives of governments should be to reduce fossil fuel exploitation and use it efficiently so as to maintain world reserves as high as possible to allow a slow reduction in populations and a narrowing of the resource use by rich and poor countries as society comes into equilibrium with resource availabilities. Traditional forms of economic growth will be impossible in a resource-depleted world. We need new forms of growth based upon intellect and human talent and skill rather than raw materials. Before any meaningful change of attitudes can take place, society has to understand that oil is truly finite - and is going to become very scarce sooner rather than later. Secondly the true cost of the conspicuous and wanton consumption of this fossil fuel energy must be identified and acknowledged and appropriate depletion strategies implemented. No longer should super rich people be able to excuse their extravagant life styles, by other compensatory actions such as planting trees, as their carbon emissions not only enhance global warming but will deteriorate the future standard of living of the populace in general, through resource depletion.

AB  - In community nutrition, sustainability refers to the ability of the program or intervention to continue over time in line with local and global economic, human and environmental resources. We can differentiate the sustainability into two major conceptual areas: The sustainability of community nutrition programs, understood as autonomy and self-financing or external independence, and the sustainability of agricultural, livestock and nutritional policies with respect to the environment. Food production exerst distinct effects on the geophysical environment, such as the degradation of species, the emission of toxins, air pollution and water consumption. The changes in diet related to reducing animal products and increasing vegetable comsumption not only produce benefits for human health and on the overall utilization of land, but can also play a decisive role in the policies of climate change mitigation. The Mediterranean, being understood not only as a concrete set of foods but also as a cultural incorporating the ways foods are produced and processed, is an example of sustainability, in wich biodiversity is also key. Sustainability should be considered as a fundamental element when planning and defining community nutrition interventions and should constitute a key issue in the agenda for climate change mitigation. © 2009 SENC.

AB  - Climate data are usefully applied to many economic and societal sectors. Sustained, high quality and uninterrupted climate observations are vital for the development of all countries, because climate variability and change impact significantly on economies and societies. The sectors treated in this paper include the key areas of human health, energy and water. The special needs for research and for the development of strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change are also considered. All countries should be encouraged to give high priority to national needs for observations in their national adaptation planning. The full implementation of the Global Climate Observing System is required to ensure that countries are able to understand and manage climate variability and change over the twenty-first century. © 2010 Published by Elsevier.

AB  - Besides the 'big three'-HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis-there are a host of diseases that, by comparison, are truly neglected. These so-called neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), many of which caused by helminths, are intimately linked with poverty and are rampant where housing is poor; access to clean water and adequate sanitation is lacking; hygiene and nutrition is substandard and populations are marginalised and vulnerable. More than a billion people are affected by NTDs, mainly in remote rural and deprived urban settings of the developing world. An overview of papers published in two special thematic volumes of the Advances in Parasitology is provided here under the umbrella of current status of research and control of important helminth infections. A total of 25 comprehensive reviews are presented, which summarise the latest available data pertaining to the diagnosis, epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, treatment, control and eventual elimination of NTDs in Southeast Asia and neighbourhood countries. The focus of the first volume provides the current regional status of schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, food-borne trematodiases, echinococcosis and cysticercosis/taeniasis, less common parasitic diseases that can cause epidemic outbreaks and helminth infections affecting the central nervous system. The second volume deals with the tools and strategies for control, including diagnostics, drugs, vaccines and cutting-edge basic research (e.g. the '-omics' sciences). Moreover, cross-cutting themes such as multiparasitism, social sciences, capacity strengthening, geospatial health technologies, health metrics and modelling the potential impact of climate change on helminthic diseases are discussed. Hopefully, these two volumes will become useful for researchers and, most importantly, disease control managers for integrated and sustainable control, rigorous monitoring and eventual elimination of NTDs in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Climate change alters different localities on the planet in different ways. The impact on each region depends mainly on the degree of vulnerability that natural ecosystems and human-made infrastructure have to changes in climate and extreme meteorological events, as well as on the coping and adaptation capacity toward new environmental conditions. This study assesses the current resilience of Mexico and Mexican states to such changes, as well as how this resilience will look in the future. In recent studies (Moss et al. in Vulnerability to climate change: a quantitative approach. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Washington DC, 2001; Brenkert and Malone in Clim Change 72:57-102, 2005; Malone and Brenkert in Clim Change 91:451-476, 2008), the Vulnerability-Resilience Indicators Model (VRIM) is used to integrate a set of proxy variables that determine the resilience of a region to climate change. Resilience, or the ability of a region to respond to climate variations and natural events that result from climate change, is given by its adaptation and coping capacity and its sensitivity. On the one hand, the sensitivity of a region to climate change is assessed, emphasizing its infrastructure, food security, water resources, and the health of the population and regional ecosystems. On the other hand, coping and adaptation capacity is based on the availability of human resources, economic capacity, and environmental capacity. This paper presents two sets of results. First, we show the application of the VRIM to determine state-level resilience for Mexico, building the baseline that reflects the current status. The second part of the paper makes projections of resilience under socioeconomic and climate change and examines the varying sources and consequences of those changes. We used three tools to examine Mexico's resilience in the face of climate change, i. e., the baseline calculations regarding resilience indices made by the VRIM, the projected short-term rates of socioeconomic change from the Boyd-Ibarrarán computable general equilibrium model, and rates of the IPCC-SRES scenario projections from the integrated assessment MiniCAM model. This allows us to have available change rates for VRIM variables through the end of the twenty-first century. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

AB  - Freshwater systems are subject to multiple stressors that include changing climate, changing land use, changing demands on water resources and changing nutrient cycles. Global trends suggest these stressors that impact on water availability will increase over the coming decades, and - without action - will constrain opportunities to sustain ecosystem services to deliver the Millennium Development Goals. 2. Although a key 'service' freshwaters provide is buffering inputs from the land system, predicting ecosystem response through observation and modelling is complex because nonlinear and dynamic interactions amongst a large number of constituents operate to regulate biogeochemical transformations in freshwater systems. 3. Reductionist approaches have been successful at unravelling many of the processes and some of the interactions in freshwater systems. However, reductionist approaches cannot provide the concepts or methods to understand how system properties will emerge in response to a changing climate (particularly the changing spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation); to the consequent change in water availability and water quality in the context of social drivers on the demand for water; and to feedbacks arising from nutrient cycling across a range of scales. 4. This study presents a review of the evidence for landscape-scale filtering of nutrient delivery to receiving waters and examines the role of the internal processing of nutrients at critical interfaces such as the hyporheic in attenuating nutrient loads. Analysis of research on the spatial scales and time step appropriate for catchment and water quality observations indicates the importance of small scale and short time step data for unravelling nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems. 5. Thematic implications: leading work in the catchment and aquatic sciences on the importance of diffuse nutrient losses from land, and on nutrient cycling in freshwaters, in governing water quality and protecting water availability, is making an increasing contribution to mainstream environmental science. Critically, the evidence base is starting to grow to inform policy-related debates with respect to food security, to climate change adaptation and for sustaining ecosystem services in freshwater environments. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Overwhelming evidence shows that climate change presents growing threats to public health security - from extreme weather-related disasters to wider spread of such vector-borne diseases as malaria and dengue. The impacts of climate on human health will not be evenly distributed around the world. The Third Assessment Report (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-2001) concluded that vulnerability to climate change is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Developing country populations, particularly in small island states, arid and high mountain zones, and in densely populated coastal areas are considered to be particularly vulnerable. India is a large developing country, with the Great Himalayas, the world′s third largest ice mass in the north, 7500 km long, and densely populated coast line in the south. Nearly 700 million of her over one billion population living in rural areas directly depends on climate-sensitive sectors (agriculture, forests, and fisheries) and natural resources (such as water, biodiversity, mangroves, coastal zones, grasslands) for their subsistence and livelihoods. Heat wave, floods (land and coastal), and draughts occur commonly. Malaria, malnutrition, and diarrhea are major public health problems. Any further increase, as projected in weather-related disasters and related health effects, may cripple the already inadequate public health infrastructure in the country. Hence, there is an urgent need to respond to the situation. Response options to protect health from effects of climate change include mitigation as well as adaptation. Both can complement each other and together can significantly reduce the risks of climate change.

AB  - The development and survival or disappearance of civilizations has been based on the performance of soils to provide food, fibre, and further essential goods for humans. Amongst soil functions, the capacity to produce plant biomass (productivity function) remains essential. This function is closely associated with the main global issues of the 21st century like food security, demands of energy and water, carbon balance and climate change. A standardised methodology for assessing the productivity function of the global soil resource consistently over different spatial scales will be demanded by a growing international community of land users and stakeholders for achieving high soil productivity in the context of sustainable multifunctional use of soils. We analysed available methods for assessing the soil productivity function. The aim was to find potentials, deficiencies and gaps in knowledge of current approaches towards a global reference framework. Our main findings were (i) that the soil moisture and thermal regime, which are climate-influenced, are the main constraints to the soil productivity potential on a global scale, and (ii) that most taxonomic soil classification systems including the World Reference Basis for Soil Resources provide little information on soil functionality in particular the productivity function. We found (iii) a multitude of approaches developed at the national and local scale in the last century for assessing mainly specific aspects of potential soil and land productivity. Their soil data inputs differ, evaluation ratings are not transferable and thus not applicable in international and global studies. At an international level or global scale, methods like agro-ecological zoning or ecosystem and crop modelling provide assessments of land productivity but contain little soil information. Those methods are not intended for field scale application to detect main soil constraints and thereby to derive soil management and conservation recommendations in situ. We found also that (iv) soil structure is a crucial criterion of agricultural soil quality and methods of visual soil assessment like the Peerlkamp scheme, the French method Le profil cultural and the New Zealand Visual Soil Assessment are powerful tools for recognising dynamic agricultural soil quality and controlling soil management processes at field scale. We concluded that these approaches have potential to be integrated into an internationally applicable assessment framework of the soil's productivity function, working from field scale to the global level. This framework needs to serve as a reference base for ranking soil productivity potentials on a global scale and as an operational tool for controlling further soil degradation and desertification. Methods like the multi-indicator-based Muencheberg Soil Quality Rating meet most criteria of such a framework. This method has potential to act as a global overall assessment method of the soil productivity function for cropping land and pastoral grassland but needs further evolution by testing and amending its indicator thresholds. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Sustainability rests on the principle that we must meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Starving people in poor nations, obesity in rich nations, increasing food prices, on-going climate changes, increasing fuel and transportation costs, flaws of the global market, worldwide pesticide pollution, pest adaptation and resistance, loss of soil fertility and organic carbon, soil erosion, decreasing biodiversity, desertification, and so on. Despite unprecedented advances in sciences allowing us to visit planets and disclose subatomic particles, serious terrestrial issues about food show clearly that conventional agriculture is no longer suited to feeding humans and preserving ecosystems. Sustainable agriculture is an alternative for solving fundamental and applied issues related to food production in an ecological way [Lal (2008) Agron. Sustain. Dev. 28, 57-64]. While conventional agriculture is driven almost solely by productivity and profit, sustainable agriculture integrates biological, chemical, physical, ecological, economic and social sciences in a comprehensive way to develop new farming practices that are safe and do not degrade our environment. To address current agronomical issues and to promote worldwide discussions and cooperation we implemented sharp changes at the journal Agronomy for Sustainable Development from 2003 to 2006. Here we report (1) the results of the renovation of the journal and (2) a short overview of current concepts of agronomical research for sustainable agriculture. Considered for a long time as a soft, side science, agronomy is rising fast as a central science because current issues are about food, and humans eat food. This report is the introductory article of the book Sustainable Agriculture, volume 1, published by EDP Sciences and Springer (Lichtfouse et al., 2009, this book). © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

AB  - Enhancing food production and supporting civil/engineering structures have been the principal foci of soil science research during most of the nineteenth and the first seven or eight decades of the twentieth century. Demands on soil resources during the twenty first century and beyond include: (1) increasing agronomic production to meet the food needs of additional 3.5 billion people that will reside in developing countries along with likely shift in food habits from plant-based to animal-based diet, (2) producing ligno-cellulosic biomass through establishment of energy plantations on agriculturally surplus/marginal soils or other specifically identified lands, (3) converting degraded/desertified soils to restorative land use for enhancing biodiversity and improving the environment, (4) sequestering carbon in terrestrial (soil and trees) and aquatic ecosystems to off-set industrial emissions and stabilize the atmospheric abundance of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, (5) developing farming/cropping systems which improve water use efficiency and minimize risks of water pollution, contamination and eutrophication, and (6) creating reserves for species preservation, recreation and enhancing aesthetic value of soil resources. Realization of these multifarious soil functions necessitate establishment of inter-disciplinary approach with close linkages between soil scientists and chemists, physicists, geologists, hydrologists, climatologists, biologists, system engineers (nano technologists), computer scientists and information technologists, economists, social scientists and molecular geneticists dealing with human, animal and microbial processes. While advancing the study of basic principles and processes, soil scientists must also reach out to other disciplines to address the global issues of the twenty first century and beyond. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

AB  - Over the past two-to-three hundred years, humanity's ecological footprint has ballooned to such an extent that we are now fundamentally altering the planet. We have transformed the Earth's land surface and altered the function of its ecosystems, and we are triggering the rapid loss of both terrestrial and marine life. We are also profoundly changing our planet's climate. It is increasingly apparent that the breadth and depth of the changes we are wreaking on the environment are imperiling not only many of the other species with which we share the ecological stage, but the health and wellbeing of our own species as well. Global climate change threatens human health in numerous and profound ways. Large segments of the population will experience more heat waves, altered exposure to infectious disease, and more-frequent natural disasters. Most significantly, climatic disruption threatens the adequacy of the core "building blocks" of health for large populations around the globe: sufficient food and nutrition, safe water for drinking and sanitation, fresh air to breathe, and secure homes to live in. As climate change dismantles these central elements of healthy societies, people with fewer resources will be forced to migrate in large numbers to lands where they may not be welcome. A likely result of all of these processes will be increased civic instability and strife. Even if the global climate were stable, humans would still be converting more land, water, and ecosystem services for their own now endanger health and wellbeing globally and on scales never experienced in human history. These threats include: exposure to infectious disease, air pollution, water scarcity, food scarcity, natural disasters, and population displacement. Taken together, they represent the greatest public health challenge of the 21st century. We need to wake up to the danger and act with urgency to reduce ecological disruption as much as possible while simultaneously strengthening the resilience of populations to withstand the impacts of unavoidable environmental change. Populations vary dramatically in their vulnerabilities to these emerging health threats, in part because the environmental changes that are triggering these threats are not uniform. Rapid glacial melting on the Tibetan plateau threatens the dry-season water supply for more than 1 billion people living and growing irrigated crops in Asia's great river basins. In sub- Saharan Africa, droughts and increased temperatures caused by climate change will interact with existing soil degradation, nutrient loss, and water scarcity to further reduce crop yields and constrain food supplies. The triple threat of more-severe storms, rising sea levels, and degraded coastal barriers-such as mangrove forests, coral reefs, wetlands, vegetated dunes, and barrier islands-will pose significant risks to low-lying coastal populations. But vulnerability is not determined only by a population's exposure to health threats; it is also determined by the ability to adapt in the face of such threats. Many of the threats associated with global environmental change can be mitigated by means of trade, technology, infrastructure, behavior change, philanthropy, and use. The environmental changes from these activities are combining to magnify several public health threats to the extent that they governance. Populations with the resources- both economic and socio-cultural-to engage these mechanisms will suffer less than those without such resources. As a consequence, climate change threatens to further accentuate the divide between rich and poor, both across nations and within them. Because the impacts will depend in large part on a population's location and socioeconomic status, it is critical that all countries conduct rigorous, location-specific risk assessments to identify which populations are at highest risk for which threats. Governments and other stakeholders will also need to mobilize substantial financial resources, technical capacity (both in assessment and appropriate technologies), and new partnerships that can help build capacity over the long term. The health impacts of climate change present an opportunity as well as a challenge. The international community increasingly recognizes the moral imperative to help the poor reduce their vulnerability to climate change- a threat that developing countries have had little role in generating. At the same time, there is renewed emphasis on achieving the United Nations'Millennium Development Goals, as well as increasing attention in the United States to reforming foreign assistance. In this context, climate change may help to shine a light on some of the most entrenched challenges to human health in the poorest countries- including poverty, malnutrition, and infectious disease. For many years, the industrialized world has done less than it could to relieve suffering among the global poor. Now, it will need to vigorously reframe its development assistance to address the impacts of climatic disruption- impacts for which it is largely responsible. With the upcoming climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, the year 2009 may be a defining moment in human history: a year in which the historical injustice of human-induced climate change could fuel an international effort to reduce vulnerability and simultaneously address some of the longest-standing scourges to human health. Our challenge, for the rest of this century and beyond, will be to work to mitigate environmental change (for example, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and to increase the resilience of populations to the impacts of any changes that we are unable to mitigate (such as sea-level rise triggered by past emissions). Neither task should detract from the other; we must pursue both simultaneously and with equal fervor and strategic creativity. Along the way, there will be substantial opportunities to identify co-benefits, whereby a single intervention can both mitigate environmental threats and improve human health. Addressing the health impacts of global environmental change needs to be a priority for the public health community, environmental scientists, and natural resource managers, as well as for governments and intergovernmental bodies such as the United Nations and multilateral development banks. What we need most are political will and financial resources. While these resources will need to be large, they are small compared to the cost of ignoring the impacts of large-scale change and trying to address the overwhelming problems of famine, epidemic disease, massive population displacement, and civil strife that may ensue. © Worldwatch Institute, 2009.

AB  - Water pervades all human activities and thus is of fundamental importance for basic human well-being, for economic and social development, and for physical security. Water is also vital for the maintenance of the natural ecosystems on which we all ultimately depend. Thus water managers must be concerned with a large variety of issues, including water-related health issues (safe drinking water, sanitation and water-related diseases), the availability of water for food production, the water needs for energy and industrial production, and the safeguarding of societies from the ravages of floods, droughts and pollution spills. These human needs must always be balanced with consideration for the natural environment. These issues are not independent of each other - they are interlinked and thus must be treated in an integrated manner. The settings in which water managers find themselves are highly varied from region to region and country to country. Not only are climates and hydrologies extremely diverse, but the ways in which societies organize themselves are equally varied. Governance systems are based on the cultures, the religions and the attitudes of peoples. They link to the political settings, to the effectiveness of institutions, to legislative frameworks and to financial instruments. Water managers must find solutions to the challenges facing them, considering the constraints of the systems within which they work. Thus different solutions must be considered for different circumstances. Sciences (hydrological, political, social, economic) provide knowledge and understanding of the systems involved. All are essential in informing water managers in their decision-making. Hydrological science is of vital importance, but is just one of many relevant sciences. Copyright © 2009 IAHS Press.

AB  - This paper reviews the scientific information related to climate change impacts on wetlands and functions of human-made wetlands such as paddy rice field and treatment wetland are described to partially compensate for the loss of natural wetlands. Wetlands are among the world's most productive environments and are cradles of biological diversity, providing the water and primary productivity upon which countless species of plants and animals depend for survival. Considerable evidence suggests that some global warming is occurring, which has important implications for wetland system as well as human life and wildlife. Direct effects of climate change on wetlands are likely to be accentuated by human induced changes that will increase stress to wetland ecosystems. The Ramsar Classification System for Wetland Type provides three broad categories: marine/coastal wetlands, inland wetlands, and human-made wetlands. Human-made wetlands are as important as natural wetlands, and the largest human-made wetland is a paddy rice field (130,000,000 ha) taking about 18% of total global wetland, which is second only to natural fresh wetlands. Paddy rice fields provide not only rice production for food, but also diverse multi-functionalities such as flood control, groundwater recharge, soil erosion control, water quality purification, air purification and cooling, wildlife habitat, amenity and social benefits. The economic value of multi-functionalities estimated by contingent valuation method (CVM) and travel cost method was in the range of U$ 9.75-11.46 billion, which is greater than the value of rice production itself in Korea. Unfortunately, there is an indication of decreased area in paddy rice field in Korea after 1990 showing about 20% decrease in 15 years. Another human-made wetland type is a constructed wetland for water purification, and thousands hectares of wetlands are scheduled to be constructed for reservoir water quality improvement in next 5 years in Korea, and their application is expected to be more common in near future. There is a growing consensus that wetlands are critically important ecosystems that provide globally significant social, economic and environmental benefits. Wise use of human-made wetlands is as important as conservation of natural wetlands, which can be a viable element to overall climate change mitigation and can partially compensate for the loss of natural wetlands. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Large-scale anthropogenic changes to the natural environment, including land-use change, climate change, and the deterioration of ecosystem services, are all accelerating. These changes are interacting to generate five major emerging public health threats that endanger the health and well-being of hundreds of millions of people. These threats include increasing exposure to infectious disease, water scarcity, food scarcity, natural disasters, and population displacement. Taken together, they may represent the greatest public health challenge humanity has faced. There is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the dynamics of each of these threats: the complex interplay of factors that generate them, the characteristics of populations that make them particularly vulnerable, and the identification of which populations are at greatest risk from each of these threats. Such improved understanding would be the basis for stepped-up efforts at modeling and mapping global vulnerability to each of these threats. It would also help natural resource managers and policy makers to estimate the health impacts associated with their decisions and would allow aid organizations to target their resources more effectively.

AB  - This paper explores how agricultural technology has interacted with recent land use in the UK and how it might do so in the next 50 years. From 1960 to 1985, farmers successfully used technology to increase the output of crop and animal products per unit of land and particularly of labour. This reduced the number of people employed in agriculture, and promoted larger and more specialised farm enterprises. Between 1985 and 2006, food prices were relatively low, and although labour productivity continued to increase, land productivity remained relatively static. However during this period, farmers started to address the effects of agriculture on reduced water quality and habitat loss. For established agricultural products, technological innovation tends to have an incremental effect, working through genetic improvement, the removal of abiotic and biotic stress (e.g. crop nutrition and protection, irrigation and drainage, and animal nutrition, health and housing) and the substitution of labour. Whereas the first two processes tend to be scale-neutral, the substitution of labour is usually easiest to achieve on larger farms. Other key areas for technological innovation include addressing air, soil and water quality, biodiversity, waste reduction, and information management. Over the next 50 years, large step-changes in land use arising from agricultural technology are predicted to arise from the development of new markets for agricultural products. A strong bioenergy sector will strengthen the links between crop commodity and energy prices and will have a major effect on future land use. Climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will alter the relative profitability of crop and animal production systems. Lastly, increased public awareness of the links between food, health and the environment could substantially shift the demand for specific agricultural products. Continual improvements in agricultural technology are pivotal to providing society with the flexibility to balance the challenges of improving human well-being with the management of the planet's ecosystem. Increased technological innovation increases the probability that agricultural land can be used for other purposes, but the exact relationship is dependent on trade and environmental policies. The large external effects of agriculture mean that decisions regarding the adoption of future technologies should be taken by farmers working with other stakeholders. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - Historically, soils have always underpinned civilisation. Their role is fundamental to the provision of food and water, along with a wide range of ecosystem goods and services. Soils are arguably the most complex systems on Earth, and are intimately linked to human security and the integrity of the wider environment. In this paper we propose 18 ecosystem services that are critical for soils and land use in the UK. Soils are extremely heterogeneous and not all soils can fulfil the full spectrum of services required for the future of the UK, so there is a need to protect their multifunctional attributes in order to preserve national and international natural capital. There are concerns that anthropogenically induced changes in land use or management will result in soils not being utilised to provide the functions to which they are best suited. For example, soils primarily suited for food supply may be given over to provide a platform for construction. This is an all-pervading and recurring concern and highlights the importance of critical decisions, thresholds and potential 'tipping points'. Once critical soil functions are lost they are irrecoverable, potentially for millennia, representing a loss of resource that is fundamental to the UK's national livelihood and well-being. Pressures from changes in climate and to the Earth system will bring about complex and systematic change to soils and their abilities to provide essential functions. We therefore recommend national needs for ensuring the sustainability for soils and future land use in the UK. They are to maintain the long-term base for soil science through education and intellectual investment, including communication of the value of soils and land as natural capital; to manage soil resources so that multi-functionality prevails and critical tipping points are avoided; to audit the national soil resource through soil mapping; preparation of appropriate databases and provision of long-term monitoring networks and observatories; and to synthesise adaptable predictive frameworks for soil system science through integrated modelling. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - Increased sediment loading comprises one of the most important and pervasive anthropogenic impacts on aquatic ecosystems globally. In spite of this, little is known of the overall effects of increased sediment loads on lakes. By modifying both bottom-up and top-down ecological processes and restructuring energy flow pathways, increased sediment loads not only alter biotic assemblage structure and ecological functioning significantly, but frequently result in reduced biological diversity and productivity. Although lake food-webs can be subsidised to some extent by the adsorption of organic carbon to fine sediments, trophic structure and the composition of biotic assemblages remain likely to be modified considerably. The mineralogy and particle size of sediments and the availability of nutrients, by influencing both the scale and nature of impacts, are key determinants of the overall effects of increased sediment loads on lake ecosystems. Although interactions with other global anthropogenic pressures, such as invasion by exotic species and climate change, are likely to be significant, little remains known about the nature or likely strength of those interactions. Widespread increases in sediment loading to lakes have, therefore, profound implications for the conservation and management of global aquatic biological diversity. © 2009 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

AB  - Climate change is now recognised as one of the greatest challenges facing the international community and when coupled with energy production and use - the most significant contributor to climate change - and the related security problems the double threat to international security and human development is of the highest order. This wide-ranging book brings together leading thinkers from academia, government and civil society to examine and address the global insecurity and development challenges arising from the twin thrust of climate change and the energy supply crunch. Part one considers energy. It analyses the challenges of meeting future energy demands and the ongoing and future security-related conflicts over energy. Coverage includes security and development concerns related to the oil and gas, nuclear, bio-fuels and hydropower sectors, ensuring energy access for all and addressing sustainable consumption and production in both developed and rapidly industrializing countries such as India, China, Brazil and South Africa. Part two analyses how climate change contributes to global insecurity and presents a consolidated overview of the potential threats and challenges it poses to international peace and development. Coverage includes future water scenarios including a focus on scarcity in the Middle East, food security, biodiversity loss, land degradation, the changing economics of climate change, adaptation and the special case of small island states. The final part lays out the potential avenues and mechanisms available to the international community to address and avert climate and energy instability via the multilateral framework under the United Nations. It also addresses mechanisms for resource and knowledge transfer from industrialized to developing countries to ensure a low-carbon energy transition by focusing on the rapid deployment of clean energy technologies and ways to tackle income and employment insecurity created by the transition away from traditional energy sources. This book offers the most comprehensive international assessment of the challenges and solutions for tackling the global insecurity arising from climate change and energy provision and use. It is essential reading for students, researchers and professionals across international relations, security, climate change and the energy sectors. © Stakeholder Forum for our Sustainable Future, Felix Dodds, Richard Sherman and Andrew Higham, 2009.

AB  - There are growing concerns about the health impacts of climate change with ecosystem degradation and global warming, finite reserves of non-renewable energy, water shortages in food-producing regions, limits to contemporary agriculture with its dependence on exhaustible petrochemical nitrogen and rock phosphate fertilizers, and failure of the global financial system. To date, health security has meant attention to safe environments especially water, sanitation and waste disposal; and access to health care and its affordability. Its dependency on food security (safety, sufficiency, sustainability, and satisfactoriness which requires diversity and quality) has been under-estimated because the current and imminent risks have increased and extended to more populations, because these may be less tractable and because the nature, extent and dynamics of nutritionally-related health are better appreciated. As a step towards more collaborative food and health systems, the National Health Research Institutes in Taiwan has created an interdisciplinary Nutrition Consortium (NC) with research and policy agendas. The NC held a food in Health Security (FIHS) in the Asia Pacific region roundtable in conjunction with the World Vegetable Center based in Tainan, supported by the National Science Council and Academia Sinica in Taiwan and the Australian Academies of Science and of Science Technology and Engineering, August 2-5th 2009 in Taiwan. A FIHS Network is being established to further the initiative. It should form part of the broader Human Security agenda.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems and the services they provide are adversely affected by a wide variety of human activities. In particular, seagrass meadows are negatively affected by impacts accruing from the billion or more people who live within 50 km of them. Seagrass meadows provide important ecosystem services, including an estimated $1.9 trillion per year in the form of nutrient cycling; an order of magnitude enhancement of coral reef fish productivity; a habitat for thousands of fish, bird, and invertebrate species; and a major food source for endangered dugong, manatee, and green turtle. Although individual impacts from coastal development, degraded water quality, and climate change have been documented, there has been no quantitative global assessment of seagrass loss until now. Our comprehensive global assessment of 215 studies found that seagrasses have been disappearing at a rate of 110 km2yr-1since 1980 and that 29% of the known areal extent has disappeared since seagrass areas were initially recorded in 1879. Furthermore, rates of decline have accelerated from a median of 0.9% yr-1before 1940 to 7% yr-1since 1990. Seagrass loss rates are comparable to those reported for mangroves, coral reefs, and tropical rainforests and place seagrass meadows among the most threatened ecosystems on earth.

AB  - Life on earth, the climate, the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat are to a large degree dependent on the health of the oceans and its biodiversity, which supports the global ecosystem. Ocean ecosystems provide essential services, food security and livelihoods to human beings all over the world. Yet, the oceans are currently or potentially threatened by human activities and their consequences, including: overfishing, destructive fishing practices, climate change, pollution from many sources, ocean acidification, habitat destruction, the spread of alien species, mineral exploration and exploitation, ocean dumping, underwater noise, marine debris, carbon sequestration, pipelines and cables, tourism, bioprospecting and marine scientific research. If we are to continue to benefit from the resources and services provided by the oceans, we must take urgent action to counter these threats. Some problems are already being addressed in various international instruments, most of which apply beyond national jurisdiction. However, because of the seriousness of the threats to marine ecosystems, States are considering whether existing measures are sufficient. Furthermore, with the recognition of the need to take an integrated, ecosystem approach to ocean management, some States are calling for an implementing agreement to the UN Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC) to address both the conservation and the sustainable use of marine biological resources beyond national jurisdiction. This paper examines the legal background and urges States to elaborate an implementing agreement to the LOSC to create a new regime for marine biodiversity and genetic resources beyond national jurisdiction. © 2009 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

AB  - Information on the effects of global climate change on trends in global fisheries biomass yields has been limited in spatial and temporal scale. Results are presented of a global study of the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) changes over the last 25 years on the fisheries yields of 63 large marine ecosystems (LMEs) that annually produce 80% of the world's marine fisheries catches. Warming trends were observed.in 61 LMEs around the globe. In 18 of the LMEs, rates of SST warming were two to four times faster during the past 25 years than the globally averaged rates of SST warming reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007. Effects of warming on fisheries biomass yields were greatest in the fast-warming northern Northeast Atlantic LMEs, where increasing trends in fisheries biomass yields were related to zooplankton biomass increases. In contrast, fisheries biomass yields of LMEs in the fast-warming, more southerly reaches of the Northeast Atlantic were declining in response to decreases in zooplankton abundance. The LMEs around the margins of the Indian Ocean, where SSTs were among the world's slowest warming, revealed a consistent pattern of fisheries biomass increases during the past 25 years, driven principally by human need for food security from fisheries resources. As a precautionary approach toward more sustainable fisheries utilization, management measures to limit the total allowable catch through a cap-and-sustain approach are suggested for the developing nations recently fishing heavily on resources of the Agulhas Current, Somali Current, Arabian Sea, and Bay of Bengal LMEs. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2009.

AB  - Soil, together with water, is a basic resource for humanity, as it is stated in the first item of the European Soil Chart. Unlikely it has been thought for long time, soil is a limited resource, easily destroyable but not easily renewable at human life timescale, and therefore should be protected in order to preserve its fundamental functions, both biotic and abiotic. It is worth noting how the soil as a resource is poorly cared for under international conventions, in spite of its importance. The UN Convention on desertification (CCD), f. i., is based on regional development politics rather than sound scientific background, and it is disadvantaged by conceptual problems.The problem of soil conservation is one of the great emergencies in the XXI century. Recent estimates indicate losses of 20 ha/min/year soil, caused by different processes and mechanisms: wind and water erosion, deforestation and land degradation, salinisation, acidification, chemical contamination, etc. Rapid decline in quality and quantity of soil resource, and uncontrolled natural resources consumption, which affects about 33% of the Earth land surface, involving more than 1 billion people, stresses global agriculture with long term negative consequences. In the next twenty years, food security will emerge as a major global issue, forcing developed countries to provide more food, thus provoking imbalances in soil nutrient resources, soil pollution, land degradation, reduction of pedodiversity and biodiversity, increased occurrence of human health problems. New paradigms of soil science, therefore, are needed in order to encompass such dramatic global scenery. Soils are extremely important, f. i., in the global cycle of carbon. Nevertheless, consideration of soils was slow to emerge in the context of the UN Framework Convention of Climate Change (FCCC). Soil scientists could play an increasingly important role in understanding the global carbon cycle and to point out ways to reduce carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere by storing carbon in ecosystems and producing bio-fuel. But the scientific community needs also to increase the visibility of soils in international environmental, social and political context. During the last decades, the focus of societies has changed from agricultural production and forestry towards environmental issues. Soil science is increasingly targeting environmental and cultural issues, such as sustainable land use, ecosystems restoration, remediation strategies for contaminated soils, protection of the food chain and of groundwater resources, protection of human health as well as protection of soil as a cultural and natural heritage. In next years, these issues and other specific aspects, such as soil science for archaeological dating, forensic soil science, and other applications to increasing social and economic demands, will gain importance to achieve the goal of soil and land conservation in a changing world. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Agriculture is one of the most important economic sectors of global society. Agricultural production continues to expand into forest lands and marginal crop areas in an attempt to keep pace with the ever-increasing world population. Environmental damage is increasing, including erosion, salinity, desertification, deforestation, threats to biodiversity, and water scarcity. Moreover, climate change/variability is having a profound influence on agroecosystems, posing serious threats to food security, human health, and protection of the environment. Thus, comprehensive agrometeorological adaptation policy guidelines, focusing on preparedness, mitigation, and adaptation measures to support sustainable agricultural development, are needed to cope with the impacts of climate change/variability. Adaptation policy can not be an effective "stand alone" strategy, but should be incorporated into a broader policy objective. For example, adaptation to climate change should be a part of a broader socio-economic policy such as agricultural, forest, water resources, natural resources, or coastal-zone management policy. Poorer countries that will require resources to improve capacity in order to cope with impacts, undertake specific adaptation measures.

AB  - Sustainability rests on the principle that we must meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Starving people in poor nations, obesity in rich nations, increasing food prices, on-going climate changes, increasing fuel and transportation costs, flaws of the global market, worldwide pesticide pollution, pest adaptation and resistance, loss of soil fertility and organic carbon, soil erosion, decreasing biodiversity, desertification, and so on. Despite unprecedented advances in sciences allowing us to visit planets and disclose subatomic particles, serious terrestrial issues about food show clearly that conventional agriculture is no longer suited to feeding humans and preserving ecosystems. Sustainable agriculture is an alternative for solving fundamental and applied issues related to food production in an ecological way (Lal ([CITE]) Agron. Sustain. Dev. 28, 57-64.). While conventional agriculture is driven almost solely by productivity and profit, sustainable agriculture integrates biological, chemical, physical, ecological, economic and social sciences in a comprehensive way to develop new farming practices that are safe and do not degrade our environment. To address current agronomical issues and to promote worldwide discussions and cooperation we implemented sharp changes at the journal Agronomy for Sustainable Development from 2003 to 2006. Here we report (1) the results of the renovation of the journal and (2) a short overview of current concepts of agronomical research for sustainable agriculture. Considered for a long time as a soft, side science, agronomy is rising fast as a central science because current issues are about food, and humans eat food.

AB  - Human activities now rival natural geological processes in transforming the Earth's surface and initiating the current global warming phase and inevitable future climate change. The record of the past 200 years of this impact, which started off with the fossil fuel driven industrial revolution, is designated the Anthropocene. This article highlights how the change is occurring globally and also focuses on the possible effects on Sri Lanka and its people, especially with regard to water availability, soil degradation and nutrient depletion, food security, ecosystem disruption and the increasing intensity of natural hazards. A harmonious Earth system is conditional on achieving a stable population and sustainable use of resources. High population growth and poorly regulated exploitation of basic resources, which are essential for life, could result in civilizational overshoot and collapse as has happened in the past. Climate change is an undeniable reality and constitutes the most critical challenge to global society and its security. It is within the capability of modern science, technology and proven socio-economic policies to reverse the negative trends and achieve a sustainable world. This will require great political will and leadership by all nations.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) contamination in tundra region has raised substantial concerns, especially since the first report of atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) in the Polar Regions. During the past decade, steady progress has been made in the research of Hg cycling in the Polar Regions. This has generated a unique opportunity to survey the whole Arctic in respect to Hg issue and to find out new discoveries. However, there are still considerable knowledge gaps and debates on the fate of Hg in the Arctic and Antarctica, especially regarding the importance and significance of AMDEs vs. net Hg loadings and other processes that burden Hg in the Arctic. Some studies argued that climate warming since the last century has exerted profound effects on the limnology of High Arctic lakes, including substantial increases in autochthonous primary productivity which increased in sedimentary Hg, whereas some others pointed out the importance of the formation and postdeposition crystallographic history of the snow and ice crystals in determining the fate and concentration of mercury in the cryosphere in addition to AMDEs. Is mercury re-emitted back to the atmosphere after AMDEs? Is Hg methylation effective in the Arctic tundra? Where the sources of MeHg are? What is its fate? Is this stimulated by human made? This paper presents a critical review about the fate of Hg in the Arctic tundra, such as pathways and process of Hg delivery into the Arctic ecosystem; Hg concentrations in freshwater and marine ecosystems; Hg concentrations in terrestrial biota; trophic transfer of Hg and bioaccumulation of Hg through food chain. This critical review of mercury fates and contamination in the Arctic tundra ecosystem is assessing the impacts and potential risks of Hg contamination on the health of Arctic people and the global northern environment by highlighting and "perspectiving" the various mercury processes and concentrations found in the Arctic tundra.

AB  - Desert ecosystems are first and foremost defined and limited by scarceness of water. Heat stress and limitations of food and nutrients resources are secondarily correlated. Water inputs are spatiotemporally highly variable and many of the ecosystem functions are pulse driven. Desert regions are found globally in the subtropical high pressure belts, in the rain shadow of mountain ranges or the continental interior, and bordering cold ocean currents. Even though primary productivity by plants and microorganisms is relatively low, species richness and taxonomical diversity can be fairly high. Taxonomically different organisms evolved traits to cope with water stress and often similar life forms arose due to convergent evolution. Typical desert organisms show traits that allow them to avoid periods of extreme aridity in inactive stages and/or to store water for use during drought; a few organisms evolved traits to tolerate the lack of water altogether. Microbial decomposition in deserts is limited due to aridity and the energy flow in desert ecosystems is dominated by detrivores that form the base of the food chain. Humans show adaptations to hot desert climates and a number of cultural practices arose that enable human populations to live near or in deserts. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agricultural land use and management is one of the most direct means by which humans impact the earth system, with significant negative environmental effects at local to global scales due to altered ecosystem processes, patterns and resource use. Multiple cropping is of particular interest because agricultural intensification has increased pressure on water resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity due to increased water withdrawals for irrigation and higher energy inputs due to mechanization and the production of chemical fertilizer. The Poyang Lake region is one of the most intensified agricultural regions in southern China, and the spatial and temporal pattern of cropping systems is determined not only by climate and water availability. Population pressure, social and economic conditions and policies, flood risks, and individual farmers' management decisions also have profound impacts. Therefore, the spatial pattern and temporal process of multiple cropping is quite complex. In this paper, we combined agro-meteorological observation data and MODIS data with a resolution of 500m at 8-day intervals to explore a novel and robust method to examine spatial and temporal dynamics of multiple cropping and crop calendar using a MODIS/EVI time series curve. The results indicate that a cropping intensity algorithm based on this data is potentially applicable for monitoring agricultural intensification. Spatial and temporal variability of multiple cropping may be the result of farmers' dynamic adaptation to local climate, socio-economic conditions, and food security. An explicit spatial and temporal analysis of the complex dynamics of multiple cropping in the context of coupled human and natural systems is necessary' for modeling and evaluating the impacts of human activity on global environmental change and food security.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of selected trends and conditions of ecosystem services, in particular, food production and impacts on the environment based on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. It then describes outcomes for future ecosystem services under alternative development pathways, with a focus on tradeoffs between food security and the environment, such as implications for fertilizer use, and the role of biofuels. As tradeoffs among various ecosystem services are expected to increase into the future, research will need to focus increasingly on ways to achieve a balance between food security and improving non-food ecosystem services. To reduce adverse future impacts, research is urgently needed in the areas of land use change impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity, mitigation strategies for climate change, enhancing water security, and for hot spot regions where ecosystem services and human well-being are particularly vulnerable, including Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa region. © TÜBİTAK.

AB  - Enhancing food production and supporting civil/engineering structures have been the principal foci of soil science research during most of the 19th and the first seven or eight decades of the 20th century. Demands on soil resources during the 21st century and beyond include: (i) increasing agronomic production to meet the food needs of additional 3.5 billion people that will reside in developing countries along with likely shift in food habits from plant-based to animal-based diet, (ii) producing ligno-cellulosic biomass through establishment of energy plantations on agriculturally surplus/marginal soils or other specifically identified lands, (iii) converting degraded/desertified soils to restorative land use for enhancing biodiversity and improving the environment, (iv) sequestering carbon in terrestrial (soil and trees) and aquatic ecosystems to off-set industrial emissions and stabilize the atmospheric abundance of CO and other greenhouse gases, (v) developing farming/cropping systems which improve water use efficiency and minimize risks of water pollution, contamination and eutrophication, and (vi) creating reserves for species preservation, recreation and enhancing aesthetic value of soil resources. Realization of these multifarious soil functions necessitate establishment of inter-disciplinary approach with close linkages between soil scientists and chemists, physicists, geologists, hydrologists, climatologists, biologists, system engineers (nano technologists), computer scientists and information technologists, economists, social scientists and molecular geneticists dealing with human, animal and microbial processes. While advancing the study of basic principles and processes, soil scientists must also reach out to other disciplines to address the global issues of the 21st century and beyond. © 2007 INRA EDP Sciences.

AB  - This article reviews critical linkages between land-use transition and human health in the Himalayan region by applying ecosystem approaches to human health (or EcoHealth). Land-use transition in the Himalayan and similar regions includes sedentarization, agricultural intensification, habitat modification, migration, change of livelihoods and lifestyles, biodiversity loss, and increasing flash floods. These transitions, which can have impacts on human health, are driven by state policies, a market economy, and climate change. Human health is dependent on access to ecosystem services for food, nutrition, medicine, fiber and shelter, fresh water, and clear air. Ecosystem management has been a key means of controlling disease vectors and creating suitable habitats for human well-being. The paper identifies the web of environmental factors that influence human health. Institutional and policy issues for land-use and health transitions are also discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Traditional biomass remains the dominant contributor to the energy supply of a large number of developing countries, where it serves the household energy needs of over a third of humanity in traditional cookstoves or open fires. Efforts to reduce the enormous human health, socioeconomic, and environmental impacts by shifting to cleaner cookstoves and cleaner biomass-derived fuels have had some success, but much more needs to be done, possibly including the expanded use of fossil-derived fuels. Concurrendy, biomass is rapidly expanding as a commercial energy source, especially for transport fuels. Bioenergy can positively contribute to climate goals and rural livelihoods; however, if not implemented carefully, it could exacerbate degradation of land, water bodies, and ecosystems; reduce food security; and increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For largescale commercial biofuels to contribute to sustainable development will require agriculturally sustainable methods and markets that provide enhanced livelihood opportunities and equitable terms of trade. The challenge lies in translating the opportunity into reality. Copyright © 2007 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

AB  - Current global fisheries production of ≈160 million tons is rising as a result of increases in aquaculture production. A number of climate-related threats to both capture fisheries and aquaculture are identified, but we have low confidence in predictions of future fisheries production because of uncertainty over future global aquatic net primary production and the transfer of this production through the food chain to human consumption. Recent changes in the distribution and productivity of a number of fish species can be ascribed with high confidence to regional climate variability, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Future production may increase in some high-latitude regions because of warming and decreased ice cover, but the dynamics in low-latitude regions are governed by different processes, and production may decline as a result of reduced vertical mixing of the water column and, hence, reduced recycling of nutrients. There are strong interactions between the effects of fishing and the effects of climate because fishing reduces the age, size, and geographic diversity of populations and the biodiversity of marine ecosystems, making both more sensitive to additional stresses such as climate change. Inland fisheries are additionally threatened by changes in precipitation and water management. The frequency and intensity of extreme climate events is likely to have a major impact on future fisheries production in both inland and marine systems. Reducing fishing mortality in the majority of fisheries, which are currently fully exploited or overexploited, is the principal feasible means of reducing the impacts of climate change. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

AB  - Agriculture is a vital activity for the well-being of humanity. Even though it is practiced at a local level, it both uses nutrients from the local, national, regional, and global levels and provides nutrients needed to support human populations at all of them. With human populations increasing at 1 to 2 percent per year in many developed nations and in some developing nations at more than 3 percent per year, demands for food are constantly increasing (UNFPA 2002). The productivity per area of arable land must increase in order to match the demand with supply (Helling 1993). Arable land resources are considered a renewable resource as long as good "stewardship" is practiced. However, high-quality arable land is a finite resource, and the use of marginal land for agriculture is undesirable since the demand for nutrients exceeds its capacity and, in due time, it degrades and becomes nonrenewable. Fortunately, lands that are marginal for agriculture use are prime lands for other appropriate uses, which provide vital global environmental services (Helling 1993). A good example of providing vital environmental services is the land that is marginal for agriculture in the humid tropical forests. These forests sequester carbon and provide a vital filtration mechanism to the atmosphere as well as hosting the great majority of the earth's biodiversity, an invaluable treasure indispensable to the survival of humanity. In this ecosystem, if the land is deforested and used for agriculture, the fragile soil fertility is lost very quickly due to the extreme climate conditions. In time, this depleted land cannot provide the required nutrient supply, and it no longer provides the original carbon sequestering service to the globe or the habitat necessary for all the species that once lived there (Piel 1992; Panayotou 1993). The "green revolution" was a strategy designed to increase the productivity of arable land. It entailed monocultures, which provided higher yields but also optimal conditions for the growth and development of pests. In response, agrochemical applications, especially pesticides and fertilizers, became a generalized management practice. This approach has been used very intensively in the humid tropical regions of Latin America (FAO 1995). This increased use of pesticides was a successful technology because the response or return on investment was good in the short term. However, this practice has degenerated into an uncontrolled and indiscriminate use of these agrochemicals under the philosophy of "If little is good, more is better." One of the most relevant reasons for the extensive use of pesticides is the estimated amount of crop losses due to pests such as insects, nematodes, diseases, and weeds. Despite the global application of approximately 3,000,000 MT of pesticides each year, pests destroy more than 40 percent of the world's crop production (Pimentel 1997). It is estimated, however, that pests could destroy as much as 50-60 percent of worldwide crop production if pesticide controls were not utilized (Pimentel 1998). There were very few voices raised alerting the public to the biological and environmental health risk involved in the abusive application of pesticides, first called technical advances and later archetype management practices. For example, there is evidence that some of these chemicals accumulate in plant and animal tissue, and that eventually they may work their way up through the food chain, posing a risk to human health. Studies show that in the world today there are over sixty-five thousand synthetic chemicals in use and that approximately ten thousand are regularly applied. Of these, only about 2 percent have adequate risk assessment information (McCarthy and Shugart 1990). There is also evidence that a considerable amount of applied pesticides is transported out of the application zones by surface runoff and leaching and is deposited in streams and rivers. These watercourses eventually reach the sea, causing effects at a local, national, regional, and global level. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (McKay, Mulvaney, and Thorne- Miller 2000) recognizes eight major causes of environmental change and degradation in oceans. Two of these, chemical pollution and nutrient pollution, can be related directly to agricultural activities. Excessive agrochemical applications leading to chemical pollution can cause poisoning, chronic diseases, reproduction failure, or deformities in marine life. Excessive fertilization, and hence nutrient pollution, increases algae growth, oxygen depletion, water turbidity, and loss of species (McKay, Mulvaney, and Thorne-Miller 2000). The strategies to solve the problem of pesticide movement out of the application zone must be handled at a watershed level. However, the solution-the application of best management practices-must be applied at a farm level. Consequently, the additional costs and investments due to the application of best management practices apply at a local level. Nevertheless, the benefits are enjoyed at a local, national, regional, and global level. In order to provide an incentive for the individual farmer to apply better management practices now, it is necessary to distribute the cost among all the beneficiaries. The question is how to measure this benefit at each level, and how to allocate the costs proportionately to each level. Policies need to be set at all levels, and this entails multilateral negotiations. This chapter explores possible joint solutions to the problem of pesticide movement out of the application zone, and subsequent natural water resources contamination, in a specific subregion of the Caribbean Sea, the Mesoamerican Caribbean Basin (MCB). © 2007 by the University of New Mexico Press.

AB  - Small farmers from the tropics are struggling to sustain their livelihoods while the world's natural and policy environment is changing. Trade liberalization affects many of these farmers differently- often negatively when subsidies and protections are removed, sometimes under the direction of "structural adjustment" programs of, for example, the IMF or the World Bank; in some cases positively when previous policies were biased against agriculture and when a freer access to market expands opportunities. Looking beyond short-term profits, the question of whether the new policies induce more sustainable production systems is still quite ambiguous. Small farmers are also struggling to adopt new technologies. There seemingly is a large variety of technologies available, but adoption is still low among small farmers from tropical countries. What type of policies and what type of technologies can help improve productivity of poor farmers while maintaining the resource base? To what degree do these new technologies make small farmers beholden to debt, the industrialized countries, and the probable future increases in the price of petroleum and its products? To answer these questions, one has to study farming systems in some detail and make some predictions about how these systems will respond, change, and adapt to external incentives while population is increasing rapidly even as natural resources are under increasing pressure. Teams of economists and agriculturalists join their expertise to link farming system analysis and natural resources processes with human behavioral models to simulate the dynamics of the farming systems under various scenarios. In this chapter we present a few applications of these bioeconomic models to address the impacts of increasing population pressure, increasing access to markets, and external incentives related to welfare and natural resources management. What are the relations between these factors and environmental degradation? What are the policy and technical options to make these systems more sustainable? In the first part of the chapter, we present the tropical agroecosystems that we studied. In the second, we review the use of bioeconomic models in agriculture. In the third we describe a few applications, and in the last part we present overall results and conclusions. The Tropical Agroecosystems Studied Tropical small-scale farming systems are numerous and diverse but can be categorized according to a gradient of management intensity from slash-andburn to permanent agriculture (Ruthenberg 1980). In this chapter we analyze and compare the fallow systems from the savanna of West Africa, the forest systems of the hillsides of Central America, the rancher system of the humid forest margin of Amazonia in Brazil, and the permanent intensive systems of the subhumid Gangetic Plain of northern India as representative of this gradient of intensification. In West Africa, increasing population pressure on land should lead, at least according to the Boserup school of thought, to labor and capital intensification and to the adoption of new technologies (Boserup 1965; see chapter 12). Instead, we observe migrations either to less-populated rural areas or to overcrowded cities. Trade liberalization of the mid-1990s was supposed to free farmers from an "inefficient" state, but while the devaluation of an overvalued currency had a positive impact, privatization led to market failures and too often the destruction of these farmers' way of subsistence. The three African villages studied, located on a north-south transect representing a gradient of increasing rainfall, are typical of their climatic conditions. The Sahelian village of Banizoumbou in Niger (ILRI dataset 1998) was used to predict the future of transhumance in the Sahel (Barbier and Hazell 2000). Increasing population pressure and expansion of cropland makes the traditional transhumance migrations of cattle and sheep from north to south more difficult every year. While most "experts" believe that nomadism has no future, a recent school of thought argues that it is the most suitable human activity for the Sahelian ecosystem (Scoones 1996). The other semiarid village, Kolbila on the Mossi Plateau of Burkina Faso (ICRISAT dataset), is less arid but is located in a much more densely populated region. Agriculture is the main activity, but its sustainability is at risk because of declining biomass and soil fertility. The village of Bala, located in the cotton-producing area of Burkina Faso (CIRAD dataset), is in a more humid region. It is less populated at present, but immigration from the north is increasing population pressure, which induces a shift from slash-andburn to a more intensive but not yet sustainable system (Barbier and BenoÎt-Cattin 1997). In Central America, we analyzed the situation of the communities on the hillsides of Honduras. In addition to being the second-poorest country of the American continent after Haiti, Honduras was hit by a hurricane in 1999, which destroyed a large part of its infrastructure and showed as well how poor management of its upper watersheds has made its valleys vulnerable to floods and landslides. Most of the fertile lowland valleys are used for extensive large-scale ranching, while small farmers struggle on the steep hillsides where the topsoil is eroding rapidly. The five Honduran watersheds where we applied bioeconomic models represent contrasting pathways of development. Farmers in the Lalima watershed follow a vegetable production pathway, producing principally a large range of vegetables. Overdrafting of the river by irrigation reduces water availability during the dry season (Barbier and Bergeron 1999). The San Nicolas watershed has become an intensive coffee production and processing area, which generates extremely high levels of water contamination that in turn affect many downstream communities (Barbier et al. 2003). The Río Calán watershed produces vegetables and coffee and supplies water to the downstream city of Siguatapeque and to a large hydroelectric dam (Jimenez et al. 2000). In the Jalapa watershed, farmers produce on steep slopes prone to rapid erosion and are part of the El Cajón watershed, which drains into a dam that generates 60 percent of the electricity used in Honduras (Hernández 2002:642). In the Choluteca watershed, widespread grain production on slopes threatens the sustainability of the shrimp industry downstream in the mangroves of the Golfo de Fonseca (Hernández et al. 2002). The large charge of sediment in the water makes shrimp production much more expensive (Samayoa 2000:647). In these watersheds, the "pathway of development" type applied by the population has been explained as principally a function of exogenous factors such as agroclimatic conditions, availability of spring water, and access to markets (Pender et al. 1999). The two watersheds that were well connected to markets have progressively expanded their vegetable production. Those located farther from a good paved road or major city have focused on coffee where rainfall is generous and on basic grain if the climate is drier. In Brazil, the Amazonian forest continues to shrink progressively under pressure from loggers followed by small farmers and finally ranchers. In some areas the Brazilian government is trying to prevent farmers from clearing more forest by allocating plots of a few dozen hectares of forest margin to families, under the condition that they will stay within these boundaries and clear only half of their holdings. One such settlement project takes place on the western southern border of the Amazonian forest (IFPRI dataset) in the regionsof Rondonia. The objective of the study was to identify the second-best alternative to slash-andburn (Carpentier et al. 1999). Is it coffee, timber production, forest products extraction, food crop, cattle ranching, or carbon sequestration? The model was supposed to verify if the new systems are economical and environmentally sustainable. The Indian study is set in Haryana state in northern India, one of the most productive states of India, and also one of the most populated. In the 1960s and 1970s the green revolution, based on improved germ plasm, chemical fertilizers, and irrigation, transformed the state into a massive producer of rice and wheat. The adoption of new techniques was helped by heavy governmental subsidies to reduce input price and stabilize output prices especially for wheat and rice (Aggarwal et al. 2000; Dorin and Landy 2002). Now that the Indian government is trying to cut subsidies to the agricultural sector, some fear that Haryana's grain production will stagnate. Now that the government wants to reduce subsidies for water and electricity, one has to assess the likely impact on production, poverty, and the environment (Alary 2002:645). Overall, the comparative study given in this chapter includes nine farming systems in four ecoregions of five countries (tables 31.1-31.3). All except the Indian example are small-scale, semicommercialized farming systems integrating crop and livestock, using mainly hand tools with little mechanization and irrigation. They are all increasingly integrated to the market, but population pressures and resource degradation are at play. © 2007 by the University of New Mexico Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the Arctic, permafrost extends up to 500m below the ground surface, and it is generally just the top metre that thaws in summer. Lakes, rivers, and wetlands on the arctic landscape are normally not connected with groundwater in the same way that they are in temperate regions. When the surface is frozen in winter, only lakes deeper than 2m and rivers with significant flow retain liquid water. Surface water is largely abundant in summer, when it serves as a breeding ground for fish, birds, and mammals. In winter, many mammals and birds are forced to migrate out of the Arctic. Fish must seek out lakes or rivers deep enough to provide good overwintering habitat. Humans in the Arctic rely on surface water in many ways. Surface water meets domestic needs such as drinking, cooking, and cleaning as well as subsistence and industrial demands. Indigenous communities depend on sea ice and waterways for transportation across the landscape and access to traditional country foods. The minerals, mining, and oil and gas industries also use large quantities of surface water during winter to build ice roads and maintain infrastructure. As demand for this limited, but heavily-relied-upon resource continues to increase, it is now more critical than ever to understand the impacts of climate change on food and water security in the Arctic. © IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This work is focused on deserts, as extreme environments, because the year 2006 has been declared Year of Deserts and Desertification by the United Nations (IYDD Program 2006). The loss of vital resources such as fresh water and soil, and the depletion of biodiversity are emerging hazards, able to transform beneficial situations into extreme environments. Desertification is generated by land degradation: the loss of biological productivity is caused by nature or by human-induced factors and climate change. Nearby the desertification process there is the increasing process of salinisation of soil and water, induced by irrigation itself, or by salt water ingress derived by tsunamis or hurricanes. Increased research on the development of salt-tolerant cultivars could, with appropriate management, result in the broader use of saline soils. Although careful application is necessary, the combination of sand, seawater, sun and salt-tolerant plants presents a valuable opportunity for many developing countries. Cooperation among plant ecologists, plant physiologists, plant breeders, soil scientists, and agricultural engineers could accelerate the development of economic salt tolerant crops. If saline water is available, the introduction of salt tolerant plants in poor regions can improve food or fuel supplies, increase employment, help stem desertification, and contribute to soil reclamation. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Land degradation in the Mediterranean is as old as its history. There is ample evidence for instance showing that ancient Greeks cut their forests to expand cultivation on the sloping lands causing thus extreme erosion and leaving behind abandoned badlands. In the area of Aleppo, Syria called “hundred dead seas”, archaeological surveys demonstrate that 1-2 m of soil was washed away during the first century AD following invasion of several armies and massive deforestation. The same is true for eastern Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon showing evidence of forest clearing since Roman times. Lebanese cedars reached not only the Egyptian Pharaohs but they were used even in the Balkans for building deluxe homes. In its closest meaning land degradation brings inefficiency to the natural ecosystem in performing its functions and services, including both productivity and environmental ones. The resource base is made of several components, including climate, biosphere, water, soils, etc, and is under continuous pressure from natural events (some of them disastrous) as well as from human-induced pressures. These last could mitigate/reverse or accelerate the intensity of degradation. As long as all the components of the resource base are included in the analyses, we are discussing land degradation. Once the same pressures are imposed only on the soil component, then we are talking soil degradation that in its narrow sense means physical, chemical and biological degradation that inevitably brings inefficiency to the soil itself to perform its productivity and ecological functions. Desertification is also land degradation but according to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is confined within well-defined climatic domains that include arid, semi arid, and dry sub humid regions of the world resulting from various factors including climate variation and human activities. More closely desertification relates to drylands having an aridity index of 0.05-0.65 (excluding polar and sub-polar regions). Aridity index is calculated as the ratio of mean annual precipitation (PPT) to mean annual potential evapotranspiration (PET). Experience shows that scientists and policy/decisions makers alike use the terminology that better fits their agendas (including political ones). All the abovementioned forms of resource base degradation are present in the Mediterranean. The European Commission (EC) has been very active in its Mediterranean policies and has tackled a number of environmental issues dealing with sustainable growth, natural resources management and integrated rural development, to point out a few. The need for these interventions derives from a set of factors ranging from food security, migration, economic development, as well as peace and political stability in the region. © 2017, Environmental Science and Engineering.

AB  - Land degradation in the Mediterranean is as old as its history. There is ample evidence for instance showing that ancient Greeks cut their forests to expand cultivation on the sloping lands causing thus extreme erosion and leaving behind abandoned badlands. In the area of Aleppo, Syria called “hundred dead seas”, archaeological surveys demonstrate that 1–2 m of soil was washed away during the first century AD following invasion of several armies and massive deforestation. The same is true for eastern Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon showing evidence of forest clearing since Roman times. Lebanese cedars reached not only the Egyptian Pharaohs but they were used even in the Balkans for building deluxe homes. In its closest meaning land degradation brings inefficiency to the natural ecosystem in performing its functions and services, including both productivity and environmental ones. The resource base is made of several components, including climate, biosphere, water, soils, etc, and is under continuous pressure from natural events (some of them disastrous) as well as from human-induced pressures. These last could mitigate/reverse or accelerate the intensity of degradation. As long as all the components of the resource base are included in the analyses, we are discussing land degradation. Once the same pressures are imposed only on the soil component, then we are talking soil degradation that in its narrow sense means physical, chemical and biological degradation that inevitably brings inefficiency to the soil itself to perform its productivity and ecological functions. Desertification is also land degradation but according to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is confined within well-defined climatic domains that include arid, semi arid, and dry sub humid regions of the world resulting from various factors including climate variation and human activities. More closely desertification relates to drylands having an aridity index of 0.05–0.65 (excluding polar and sub-polar regions). Aridity index is calculated as the ratio of mean annual precipitation (PPT) to mean annual potential evapotranspiration (PET). Experience shows that scientists and policy/decisions makers alike use the terminology that better fits their agendas (including political ones). All the abovementioned forms of resource base degradation are present in the Mediterranean. The European Commission (EC) has been very active in its Mediterranean policies and has tackled a number of environmental issues dealing with sustainable growth, natural resources management and integrated rural development, to point out a few. The need for these interventions derives from a set of factors ranging from food security, migration, economic development, as well as peace and political stability in the region. One of the projects funded by the EC under the 5th Framework Programme is also the MEDCOASTLAND Thematic Network whose main goal is Mediterranean coordination and dissemination of land conservation management to combat land degradation for the sustainable use of natural resources in the region with special emphases on coastal areas. The network brings together 13 countries (from northern Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, Middle and Near East) making a total of 32 partners, of whom 17 are research and educational institutions, 7 represent decision makers and the remaining 8 are farmer’s associations and/or non governmental organisations (NGOs). The International Centre for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies (CIHEAM) through the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Bari (MAI-B), in Italy is coordinating the project that runs from October 2002 until May 2007. MEDCOASTLAND endorses the ecosystem-based approach in natural resource management by giving equal importance to both biophysical and socio-economic features. Conclusions show that the fight against land degradation could be successful if land users meet their basic needs through income generating activities and if a good balance is found between bottom-up and top-down decision making and last but not least, if policy, legislation, and the institutional framework make their way towards implementation. Above all a stakeholder approach is needed where every one is aware of its duties and responsibilities. © 2007, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Human land-use activities, while extracting natural resources such as food, fresh water, and fiber, have transformed the face of the planet. Such large-scale changes in global land use and land cover can have significant consequences for food production, freshwater supply, forest resources, biodiversity, regional and global climates, the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc. In particular, land management and changes in land use can affect fluxes of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. Recently, Hannah et al. (1994) estimated that roughly 50% of the planet’s land surface (75% of the habitable area) has been either moderately or severely disturbed; only the core of the tropical rainforests and boreal forests, deserts, and ice-covered surfaces are still relatively untouched by humans. Moreover, Vitousek et al. (1997) estimated that around 40% of the global net primary productivity is being co-opted by humans, while Postel et al. (1996) estimated that over 50% of the available renewable freshwater supply is being co-opted. The major mode of human land transformation has been through agriculture. Since the invention of agriculture, ~10 000 years ago, humans have modified or transformed the land surface; today, roughly a third of the planet’s land surface is being used for growing crops or grazing animals (National Geographic Maps, 2002; Foley et al., 2003). © Cambridge University Press 2007, Cambridge University Press, 2010.

AB  - Despite their great socio-economic importance, sandy beaches have attracted little ecological research. This is unfortunate since, contrary to popular belief, they support diverse ecological assemblages whose species are mostly small and buried and which deserve protection as part of ecologically sustainable development (ESD). Moreover, the management of beaches and linked adjacent ecosystems is becoming increasingly important because of their vulnerability to burgeoning human pressures including climate change. Although there are large uncertainties involved, some of the climate-related environmental changes and their ecological consequences for sandy beaches are explored in this paper, some management issues discussed and research proposed. Temperature-related changes include the likelihood that the geographical ranges of some species will change, some cool-adapted species will decline in abundance, possibly to extinction, and the rate of processes such as decomposition and photosynthesis will increase. The increasing acidification of the ocean may affect many beach species directly via reduced calcification and indirectly via changes to the phytoplankton on which some beach species depend for food. Changed hydrology may affect both nearshore primary productivity and the larval movements of many species. Increased storminess may change the morphodynamic state of beaches with consequent effects on the diversity, abundance and composition of beach assemblages. The combination of storm surges and sea-level rise may enhance erosion rates, the most extreme effect being the total loss of sandy beach habitat, especially if sea-walls are deployed to protect coastal assets. Alternatively, in some areas there may be a slow retreat of the coastline with few effects on beach ecosystems. Concerning management, both mitigation and adaptation strategies are needed to meet public ESD goals. The former would seek to constrain the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases by addressing the underlying causes (i.e., population and economic growth) and by applying appropriate technologies. Adaptation strategies would recognise the linkages between beaches, dunes and surf zones and maintain sand movement and storage and allow for the landward migration of beaches. Failing this, the active maintenance of beaches in their present location by soft engineering (e.g., the transport of sand to the intertidal beach from elsewhere, a process called beach nourishment) is far preferable to hard engineering (e.g., sea-walls) from the nature conservation and socio-economic points of view. Since beach ecosystems are poorly understood even at basic descriptive levels, future management, monitoring, and predictions of the possible impacts of large-scale phenomena (such as global climate change) will be assisted by basic research into documenting biodiversity, community dynamics, autecology, and eco-physiology of beach fauna and the linkages with adjacent ecosystems. As well, the use of human interventions (e.g., beach nourishment) as scientific experiments combined with optimised monitoring is recommended.

AB  - This work analyses data from the OMEX core KSGX 40 (164-cm long) collected in the Galicia Mud Deposit, from the NW Iberian outer continental shelf, off the Ria de Vigo (North Spain). Sediment grain-size and benthic foraminifera distribution patterns indicate a number of substantial changes in sedimentation and also food/oxygen availability to the benthic ecosystem during the last ∼4.8 ka cal BP. Cluster analysis (Q-mode and R-mode) based on the most abundant taxa was used to recognize similarities within the data set. Three main clusters were established by Q-mode cluster analysis. The species distribution pattern of two of these three clusters is clearly related with changes in texture of the sediments. Textural data and benthic foraminifera proxies suggest that between ∼4.8 and 2.2 ka cal BP there was a period of higher hydrodynamism, with more energetic oceanic currents associated with shelf mixed waters. The period since ∼2.2 ka cal BP until present was characterized by generally lower bottom energetic conditions and by a supply of finer sediment, which was richer in organic matter leading to more eutrophic conditions in the benthic environment, mainly between ∼2.2 and 1.2 ka cal BP and since ∼0.5 ka cal BP until the present. Eutrophication was probably determined by strong water column stratified conditions and by coastal upwelling-dominated depositional intervals and/or by higher lateral flux of organic carbon. Since the upwelling increasing periods are in general due the intensification of northerly winds, both most productive upwelling-dominated periods may be attributed to climatic/oceanographic induced changes during the Sub-Atlantic climate. Small sea levels oscillations also should contribute to these results. Eutrophication since the end of Little Ice Age may be related to human influence in coastal areas.

AB  - Climate change will disturb the Earth's physical systems (e.g. weather patterns) and ecosystems (e.g. disease vector habitats); these disturbances, in turn, will pose direct and indirect risks to human health. Direct risks involve climatic factors that impinge directly on human biology. Indirect risks do not entail direct causal connections between climatic factors and human biology. The Third Assessment Report (TAR) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change elucidates the potential human health impacts of global climate change at both a population and regional level. The impacts on child health, adult health, and the health of the elderly, however, remain largely unexplored. A paucity of research regarding women's health is also extant, despite increasing interest in the issue. According to the TAR, climate change is projected to affect such key issues as air quality, food yields and nutrition, water-related infectious diseases, and water supply. Exposure to cooking fuels, access to food, distribution of food within the family, and choice of water sources is often determined by gender. Thus, women's contributions may, in some cases, make them more vulnerable than their male counterparts to climate change. Moreover, it is anticipated that health care will significantly help people adapt to climate change. Unfortunately, not everyone has adequate health care. In some countries, fewer than 25 % of women visit health-care professionals. Climate change is likely to have a strong, positive (worsening) effect on smog and acidic deposition; climate change is likely to have some effect on suspended particulates. In light of the foregoing, this paper addresses the interrelated and neglected areas of global climate change, air pollution, and women's health.

AB  - Traditional household fuels involving crop residue and animal dung have severe adverse impacts on soil quality, air quality, water quality, climate and human health. The use of crop residues for fuel and non-use of animal dung for manure have exacerbated the problem of soil and environmental degradation. The attendant decline in soil quality, reduction in agronomic productivity and environment moderation capacity are biophysical processes driven by socio-economic and political forces. The problem is widespread in developing countries where extractive farming practices of mining soil fertility are widely used by resource-poor farmers. Biomass productivity of these degraded soils/wasteland is too low and uneconomic. With rapid increase in population in Asia and Africa, the per capita arable land area is decreasing and is already 0.1 ha in several densely populated countries, and arable land cannot be converted to biofuel plantations. Establishing biofuel plantations (e.g., Jatropha, Pongamia) on degraded soils can be a win-win strategy provided that these soils are adequately restored and specific problems (e.g., nutrient and water imbalance, loss of topsoil, shallow rooting depth, drought stress, salinization, compaction, crusting) are alleviated. Another strategy is to adopt practices of land-saving technologies, such as agricultural intensification on prime agricultural lands to improve crop yields, so that surplus land can be converted to biofuel plantations. Production of biofuels can reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and advance food security, while achieving energy security, improving environment quality and sequestering carbon in biota and soil. The global potential for soil carbon sequestration is 0.7 to 1.5 Pg C/yr, which can offset 20 to 40 % of the annual increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2. Trading carbon credits under the CDM or World Bank funds can provide another source of income for resource-poor farmers. The sustainability of a biofuel production system must be assessed through evaluation of the ecosystem carbon budget, accounting for carbon-based inputs in all on-farm operations and industrial processes. © 2006 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - Estuaries are among the most productive, resourceful, and dynamic aquatic ecosystems on Earth. Their productive nature is linked to the fact that they process much of the world's riverine and coastal watershed discharge. These watersheds support more than 75% of the human population and are sites of large increases in nutrient loading associated with urban and agricultural expansion. Increased nutrient loading has led to accelerated primary production, or eutrophication; symptoms include increased algal bloom activity (including harmful taxa), accumulation of organic matter, and excessive oxygen consumption (hypoxia and anoxia). While nutrient-enhanced eutrophication is a "driver" of hypoxia and anoxia, physical-chemical alterations due to climatic events, such as stormwater discharge, flooding, droughts, stagnancy, and elevated temperatures are also involved. The complex interactions of anthropogenic and climatic factors determine the magnitude, duration, and aerial extent of productivity, algal booms, hypoxia, and anoxia. Using the eutrophic Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, USA, as a case study, the physical-chemical mechanisms controlling algal bloom and hypoxia dynamics were examined. Because primary production in the NRE and many other estuaries is largely nitrogen (N) limited, emphasis has been placed on reducing N inputs. Both the amounts and chemical forms of N play roles in determining the composition and extent of phytoplankton blooms that supply the bulk of the organic carbon fueling hypoxia. Biomass from bloom organisms that are readily grazed will be readily transferred up the planktonic and benthic food chain, while toxic or inedible blooms frequently promote sedimentary C flux, microbial mineralization, and hence may exacerbate hypoxia potential. From a watershed perspective, nutrient input reductions are the main options for reducing eutrophication. Being able to distinguish the individual and cumulative effects of physical, chemical and biotic controls of phytoplankton productivity and composition is key to understanding, predicting, and ultimately managing eutrophication. Long-term collaborative (University, State, Federal) monitoring, experimental assessments, and modeling of eutrophication dynamics over appropriate spatial and temporal scales is essential for developing realistic, ecologically sound, and cost-effective nutrient management strategies for estuarine and coastal ecosystems impacted by both anthropogenic and climatic perturbations. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In rivers benthic diatom assemblages are controlled by many environmental variables, such as climate, geology or nutrients (Stevenson 1997, Snyder et al. 2002). It is therefore often difficult to understand the relationships between the different diatom taxa and the environmental parameters. Classically, multivariate analyses, such as principal component analysis, are used to project the abundance of diatom data on a two dimensional graph. The first two axes are in general used, but they represent only a part of the explained variability. Cluster analysis based on Bray-Curtis distances (Bray and Curtis 1957) or Twinspan ordinations (Hill 1979b) are also very often used techniques to sort samples of diatom assemblages into groups of homogeneous composition. The Self Organizing Maps (SOM; Kohonen 1982) are able to cluster the sites and to summarise a database on a two dimensional graph. The projection is made in a non-linear way with an artificial neural network onto a map composed of hexagons (Fig. 5.7.1), the Kohonen map. In contrast to multivariate analysis, the Kohonen map represents all the explained variability of the dataset. The projection is made thanks to an artificial neural network composed of two layers: the first one (input layer) is connected to the samples, the second one (output layer) to the hexagons of the map. The projection is made respecting the similarities between the samples. Samples with homogeneous assemblages are placed in a same hexagon or in neighbouring hexagons and samples with very different assemblages are placed in distant hexagons. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), are models that function somewhat like a human brain as they have a learning ability. They establish links between information and solutions. Only a few studies have already used this kind of techniques and have demonstrated their clustering properties for biological communities (Chon et al. 1996, Foody 1999, Giraudel and Lek 2001). Artificial Neural Networks using backpropagation algorithms (ANN-BP) are models that can be used for predicting one or several variables using other, predictive, variables. This kind of model is composed of processing elements called "neurons" which are arranged in three layers (Fig. 5.7.2). The first layer, the "input layer", is corresponding to the input variables, as, for instance, environmental parameters. The last layer, the "output layer", is composed of neurons providing a prediction for the expected variables. The layer between both, the "hidden layer", is composed of neurons composed of a non-linear function. These neurons receive information from the input neurons, transform it with the nonlinear function (log sigmoid for instance), and send this new information to the output neurons. Connections between neurons are weighted in order to modulate the importance of the information fluxes. Output neurons collect the information and give a prediction. The network is trained with a part of the database. Predictions are given and compared with the reality. The aim of the training is to find the best weights for the connections in order to get a minimal error between predictions and observations. The other part of the database, which is not used for the learning phase, is used to test the network with fixed weights (validation procedure). Several studies have already shown the ability of ANN-BP to predict the structure of macro-invertebrate or fish communities in rivers (Brosse and Lek 2000a, Chon et al. 2000c among others), density (Chon et al. 2000c) or species richness (Park et al. 2003a) of macroinvertebrate in rivers, Pacific sardine biomass (Cisneros-Mata et al. 2000) or fish species abundance in the Seine basin in France using stream order, slope, width, water quality, habitat quality and the ecoregion as input parameters (Boët and Fuhs 2000). Several studies showed that ANN-BP gives better results than other techniques such as multiple regressions (Lek et al. 1995, Brosse and Lek 2000b, Scardi 2000). This can be partly explained by the ability of artificial neural networks "to take into account the non-linear relationships between dependent variables and each independent variable" (Lek et al. 1995). Few applications exist for algal communities, besides prediction of blue-green algae blooms in rivers (Recknagel 1997) or in lakes (French and Recknagel 1994). Scardi (2000) used ANN to predict phytoplankton productivity in the Gulf of Napoli from temperature, irradiance, geographical coordinates and the day of the year as predictive variables. The structure of benthic diatom assemblages is potentially determined by many environmental factors acting at different spatial scales (Stevenson 1997, Snyder et al. 2002). Several studies established correlations between diatoms and physico-chemical variables (Stoermer and Smol 1999), and, among other applications, these observations led to the development of biotic indices to assess the water quality. These biotic indices are generally calculated with species sensitivity to pollution, their indicator value and their relative abundance. They are now routinely used in Europe (Prygiel et al. 1999) and some of them are standardized (Kelly et al. 1998, AFNOR 2000). Recently, the European Parliament (2000) required to develop new assessment tools for inland waters, which must comply to the Water Framework Directive (WFD). This directive aims to restore surface and underground waters to a good ecological status, which implies to define typologies and reference conditions for several water bodies. The WFD specifies that the ecoregional setting has to be taken into account. Ecoregions (Omernik 1987, 1995, Wasson in Cemagref 2001) classify landscapes on the basis of climates, geology, soil topography and potential vegetation. River typology can be defined for instance on the basis of distance to the source, river width, slope and maximal annual temperature (Verneaux and Leynaud 1974). The reference conditions should be defined in each river type in each ecoregion, and this can be done using modelling techniques. The first aim of this study was to explore benthic diatom assemblages in headwater streams of Luxembourg in order to propose type assemblages for unpolluted rivers of this typological level. The interest to work on a spatially reduced region and on homogeneous typological levels lies in the homogeneity of diatom and environmental data and in the precision of the classification developed. A priori, such an approach should provide more detail than studies carried out at a wider scale using data coming from very different regions and river types. Different assemblages were defined using SOM (Kohonen 1982) and could be related to distinct regions of Luxembourg. The second objective was to test whether diatom assemblages of the headwater streams of Luxembourg can be accurately predicted by using environmental parameters, in order to assess the use predictive models for defining the reference conditions as required by the WFD. ANN-BP was used to predict the groups of samples formerly defined by SOM. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

AB  - A diversified food supply is contingent on underlying biodiversity in the locality where one lives or at a distance from it, if trade routes are established. Indigenous people generally settled at the water's edge so that aquatic foods made up part of their diversified diet, with the rest of the diversity dependent on how much they hunted and gathered, on herded animals, engagement in subsistence agriculture, the ability to process and preserve food and/or food commodities traded. The rapid urbanization of much of the world's population distances people from the origin of their food, the understanding of the required commodities in the human diet (e.g., aquatic food, plant foods, lean animal foods, what animals are fed, basics of freshness). At the same time, adequacy of food intake may be more reliably achieved when the food supply can continue irrespective of season, climate or distant conflict. Urban gardens partly rectify this discord between urbanization and a genuinely varied diet, replaced by purported variety where the same basic commodity is presented in many different forms (e.g., wheat grains such as bread, breakfast cereal of various kinds, pasta and baked goods). However, diversified processing may 'dilute out' health adverse techniques. The health benefits of a diversified diet relate in part to the environmental integrity, which the required biodiversity provides, in part to minimizing adverse factors, which may exceed acceptable thresholds in a narrow diet, and to the need for the wide spectrum of food components, macronutrients, micronutrients and phytochemicals, which Homosapiens' physiology requires. Whilst most food diversity is attributable to plant sources, animal sources often provide significant nutritional security (e.g., fish and eggs for vitamin D, fish for n-3 fatty acids, lean meat for iron and zinc and in readily assimilable forms). Food diversity assumes greater importance with aging populations as their physical activity usually (if not necessarily) declines and the required food component diversity of the diet increases correspondingly. There are ways in which the required food diversity (probably 20-30 biologically different distinct foods over the course of a week) can be reduced. This is by the inclusion of more food component dense foods - like fish, lean meat, eggs, seeds and nuts. Not only does food diversity have relevance in a public health and food policy sense, but also in individual counseling in clinical practice. Assessment of a patient's food variety can be rapid and semi-quantitative, encouraging small and consequential changes in diet. When ethnicity is taken into account, in the clinical setting, this process can be even more rewarding for the practitioner and patient. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG.

AB  - Polar organisms have adapted their seasonal cycles to the dynamic interface between ice and water. This interface ranges from the micrometre-sized brine channels within sea ice to the planetary-scale advance and retreat of sea ice. Polar marine ecosystems are particularly sensitive to climate change because small temperature differences can have large effects on the extent and thickness of sea ice. Little is known about the interactions between large, long-lived organisms and their planktonic food supply. Disentangling the effects of human exploitation of upper trophic levels from basin-wide, decade-scale climate cycles to identify long-term, global trends is a daunting challenge facing polar bio-oceanography. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - Most of Australia's largest mammals became extinct 50,000 to 45,000 years ago, shortly after humans colonized the continent. Without exceptional climate change at that time, a human cause is inferred, but a mechanism remains elusive. A 140,000-year record of dietary δ13C documents a permanent reduction in food sources available to the Australian emu, beginning about the time of human colonization; a change replicated at three widely separated sites and in the marsupial wombat. We speculate that human firing of landscapes rapidly converted a drought-adapted mosaic of trees, shrubs, and nutritious grasslands to the modern fire-adapted desert scrub. Animals that could adapt survived; those that could not, became extinct.

AB  - A Sea Change in a Changing Sea The oceans, seas and coastal areas encompass over 70% of the earth's surface. They are a critical driver of the earth's hydrologic cycle and climate system, important for c- merce, transport, and tourism, a source of economically important living marine resources, minerals such as hydrocarbons, as well as new pharmaceutical compounds. The marine environment provides essential habitats for thousands of marine living 1 2 resources, which in turn contribute significantly to global food security, employment, 3 and trade. Overall, the sea's contribution to human welfare, in terms of market and non-market resources and environmental services, has been estimated at US$21 trillion/year (Costanza, 2000). However, despite the importance of the ocean realm to humans, there is a growing sense that human impacts are destabilizing this system. Some experts believe that current fishing levels are approaching or exceeding the total 4 productivity of the ocean ecosystem (National Research Council, 1999). © 2005 Springer. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - On average, Earth’s climate has warmed significantly (0.6°C) over the last century, and additional rapid changes are anticipated (Houghton et al., 2001). General circulation models for assessing future climate, coupled to direct measurements, predict that atmospheric CO2 levels will continue to increase (Schneider et al., 1992; Vitousek, 1994). More locally, significant regional climate changes in the primary agricultural regions of North America are anticipated (Rind et al., 1990; Schneider et al., 1992; Schneider, 1993; Reddy and Hodges, 2000), including increased summer temperatures (4°C to 8°C), decreased precipitation, and a significant drop in available soil water (ca. 40% to 50%), each associated with a significant change in seasonality. Some analyses indicate that both environmental changes and system responses can be sudden rather than gradual, further exacerbating the impact (Rietkerk and van de Koppel, 1997; van de Koppel et al., 1998; Alley et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2003). Human activity has greatly affected atmospheric concentrations of patterns of deposition of gaseous pollutants (e.g., SOx, NOx) that could affect insects in agro-ecosystems (Brown, 1995). In this context, important questions remain about responses of important natural and agricultural systems, including the issue of how agricultural pests and resulting food security will be affected. Diverse arthropod pests and plant pathogens significantly reduce agricultural production at present (Pimentel, 1991). How pests and their interactions with other organisms and the environment will respond to these changes, and whether such changes can be predicted is a big concern - one that requires consideration of regional and local climate changes that transcend global averages (Cammell and Knight, 1992; Lansberg and Smith, 1992; Harrington and Stork, 1995; Walther et al., 2002). The problem is complex and there are many possible ways that climate change from increased CO2 can affect the outbreak potential of insect herbivores in agricultural systems. In general, if CO2 continues to rise, average temperatures will also increase and precipitation will become more variable, suggesting that effects from temperature-dependent processes and plant responses to environmental stresses are the keys for understanding insect pests. One must also be cognizant of altered land use in the face of climate change as farmers and ranchers are likely to adapt and plant the most appropriate crops for new environmental and economic conditions. © 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - One of the most pressing global issues currently facing mankind is the increase in world population and its impact on the availability of freshwater. Recent estimates of water stocks and flows through the world's hydrologic cycle and their spatiotemporal variability illustrate the nature of current and projected water disparities throughout the world. As all such problems manifest themselves at smaller scales, a major challenge in freshwater assessments is how to handle this on different geographical scales. Increasing use of water is creating water shortages in many countries that are projected to have significant population increases in the next 25 years. Humankind is projected to appropriate from 70% to 90% of all accessible freshwater by 2025. Agriculture is the dominant component of human water use, accounting for almost 70% of all water withdrawals. Hence, many of the solutions to water-related food and environmental security come from within agriculture by increasing the efficiency and productivity of water use. Many factors significantly impact the increasing water demand, including population growth, economic growth, technological development, land use and urbanization, rate of environmental degradation, government programs, climate change, and others. Demand management, not increasing supply availability, is the realistic way forward. Although, thanks to market forces, the threatened exhaustion of nonrenewable resources has not happened, renewable resources, such as freshwater, remain problematic because they are vulnerable to human overuse and pollution. Climate change adds further risks and uncertainties to the global picture requiring the adoption of adaptive management in water resources based on monitoring and reevaluation. Although climate change may be perceived as a long-term problem, it needs to be addressed now because decisions today will affect society's ability to adapt to increasing variability in tomorrow's climate. If we are to balance freshwater supply with demand, and also protect the integrity of aquatic ecosystems, a fundamental change in current wasteful patterns of production and consumption is needed. Recognition of the links between rapidly growing populations and shrinking freshwater supplies is the essential first step in making water use sustainable. © 2004 International Association for Mathematical Geology.

AB  - Ensuring food security has been one of the major national priorities of Bangladesh since its independence in 1971. Now, this national priority is facing new challenges from the possible impacts of climate change in addition to the already existing threats from rapid population growth, declining availability of cultivable land, and inadequate access to water in the dry season. In this backdrop, this paper has examined the nature and magnitude of these threats for the benchmark years of 2030 and 2050. It has been shown that the overall impact of climate change on the production of food grains in Bangladesh would probably be small in 2030. This is due to the strong positive impact of CO2 fertilization that would compensate for the negative impacts of higher temperature and sea level rise. In 2050, the negative impacts of climate change might become noticeable: production of rice and wheat might drop by 8% and 32%, respectively. However, rice would be less affected by climate change compared to wheat, which is more sensitive to a change in temperature. Based on the population projections and analysis of future agronomic innovations, this study further shows that the availability of cultivable land alone would not be a constraint for achieving food self-sufficiency, provided that the productivity of rice and wheat grows at a rate of 10% or more per decade. However, the situation would be more critical in terms of water availability. If the dry season water availability does not decline from the 1990 level of about 100 Bm3, there would be just enough water in 2030 for meeting both the agricultural and nonagricultural needs. In 2050, the demand for irrigation water to maintain food self-sufficiency would be about 40% to 50% of the dry season water availability. Meeting such a high agricultural water demand might cause significant negative impacts on the domestic and commercial water supply, fisheries, ecosystems, navigation, and salinity management. © 2004 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - The carbon sink capacity of the world's agricultural and degraded soils is 50 to 66% of the historic carbon loss of 42 to 78 gigatons of carbon. The rate of soil organic carbon sequestration with adoption of recommended technologies depends on soil texture and structure, rainfall, temperature, farming system, and soil management. Strategies to increase the soil carbon pool include soil restoration and woodland regeneration, no-till farming, cover crops, nutrient management, manuring and sludge application, improved grazing, water conservation and harvesting, efficient irrigation, agroforestry practices, and growing energy crops on spare lands. An increase of 1 ton of soil carbon pool of degraded cropland soils may increase crop yield by 20 to 40 kilograms per hectare (kg/ha) for wheat, 10 to 20 kg/ha for maize, and 0.5 to 1 kg/ha for cowpeas. As well as enhancing food security, carbon sequestration has the potential to offset fossil-fuel emissions by 0.4 to 1.2 gigatons of carbon per year, or 5 to 15% of the global fossil-fuel emissions.

AB  - Of all of humankind's endeavours, agriculture has led to the most pressure on land, its resources and biodiversity. Over the past 50 years, the need to increase food production has resulted in the loss of one-fifth of the world's topsoil, one-fifth of its agricultural land and one-third of its forests. To slow down, and ideally reverse, this trend in the face of a predicted population increase of 50 per cent, a water shortage and climate change, new approaches will be needed. In this context, crop biotechnology and genomics have a major contributory role to play in the sustainable improvement of crop and livestock productivity, human and animal health and the development of renewable resources such as fibres, plastics, biofuels and plant-made pharmaceuticals. Manifestly, this will require both political will and international agreement. © Henry Stewart Publications.

AB  - Minerals, organic matter, and microorganisms are integral parts of the pedosphere and related environments. These three components are not separate entities but rather a united system constantly in association and interactions with each other in the terrestrial environment. Interactions of these components mediated by soil solution and atmosphere govern mechanisms of mineral weathering reactions, formation of short-range ordered (SRO) metal oxides, abiotic catalysis of the formation of humic substances, formation of organo-mineral complexes, microbial ecology, enzymatic activity, soil structure stability, dynamics of aggregate turnover, biogeochemical cycling of C, N, P, and S, and transformations and dynamics of metals and organic pollutants in the terrestrial environment. Foreseeable impacts of these interactions include global ion cycling and climate change, biodiversity, biological productivity and human nutrition, geomedicine, ecotoxicology and human health, biotechnology in relation to food production and security, risk assessment, and ecosystem restoration. Therefore, soil mineral-organic matter-microorganism interactions play a key role in influencing agricultural sustainability and ecosystem health. Fundamental understanding of these interactions at the molecular level is essential for developing innovative management strategies for land and water resources. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper quantifies the eco-hydrological challenge up until 2050 of producing food in balance with goods and services generated by water-dependent ecosystems in nature. Particular focus is given to the savannah zone, covering 40% of the land area in the world, where water scarcity constitutes a serious constraint to sustainable development. The analysis indicates an urgent need for a new green revolution, which focuses on upgrading rain-fed agriculture. Water requirements to produce adequate diets for humans are shown to be relatively generic irrespective of hydro-climate, amounting to a global average of 1300 m3 cap-1 yr-1. Present food production requires an estimated 6800 km3 yr-1 of consumptive green water (5000 km3 yr-1 in rain-fed agriculture and 1800 km3 yr-1 from irrigated crops). Without considering water productivity gains, an additional 5800 km3 yr-1 of water is needed to feed a growing population in 2050 and eradicate malnutrition. It is shown that the bulk of this water will be used in rain-fed agriculture. A dynamic analysis of water productivity and management options indicates that large 'crop per drop' improvements can be achieved at the farm level. Vapour shift in favour of productive green water flow as crop transpiration could result in relative water savings of 500 km3 yr-1 in semi-arid rain-fed agriculture.

AB  - Global food security will remain a worldwide concern for the next 50 years and beyond. Recently, crop yield has fallen in many areas because of declining investments in research and infrastructure, as well as increasing water scarcity. Climate change and HIV/AIDS are also crucial factors affecting food security in many regions. Although agroecological approaches offer some promise for improving yields, food security in developing countries could be substantially improved by increased investment and policy reforms.

The deep-sea floor ecosystem is one of the largest on the planet, covering roughly 60% of the Earth's solid surface. Despite this vast size, our knowledge of the deep sea is poor relative to other marine ecosystems, and future human threats are difficult to predict. Low productivity, low physical energy, low biological rates, and the vastness of the soft-sediment deep sea create an unusual suite of conservation challenges relative to shallow water. The numerous, but widely spaced, island habitats of the deep ocean (for example seamounts, hydrothermal vents and submarine canyons) differ from typical deep-sea soft sediments in substrate type (hard) and levels of productivity (often high); these habitats will respond differently to anthropogenic impacts and climate change. The principal human threats to the deep sea are the disposal of wastes (structures, radioactive wastes, munitions and carbon dioxide), deep-sea fishing, oil and gas extraction, marine mineral extraction, and climate change. Current international regulations prohibit deep-sea dumping of structures, radioactive waste and munitions. Future disposal activities that could be significant by 2025 include deep-sea carbon-dioxide sequestration, sewage-sludge emplacement and dredge-spoil disposal. As fish stocks dwindle in the upper ocean, deep-sea fisheries are increasingly targeted. Most (perhaps all) of these deep-sea fisheries are not sustainable in the long term given current management practices; deep-sea fish are long-lived, slow growing and very slow to recruit in the face of sustained fishing pressure. Oil and gas exploitation has begun, and will continue, in deep water, creating significant localized impacts resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings. Marine mineral extraction, in particular manganese nodule mining, represents one of the most significant conservation challenges in the deep sea. The vast spatial scales planned for nodule mining dwarf other potential direct human impacts. Nodule-mining disturbance will likely affect tens to hundreds of thousands of square kilometres with ecosystem recovery requiring many decades to millions of years (for nodule regrowth). Limited knowledge of the taxonomy, species structure, biogeography and basic natural history of deep-sea animals prevents accurate assessment of the risk of species extinctions from large-scale mining. While there are close linkages between benthic, pelagic and climatic processes, it is difficult to predict the impact of climate change on deep-sea benthic ecosystems; it is certain, however, that changes in primary production in surface waters will alter the standing stocks in the food-limited, deep-sea benthic. Long time-series studies from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that even seemingly stable deep-sea ecosystems may exhibit change in key ecological parameters on decadal time scales. The causes of these decadal changes remain enigmatic. Compared to the rest of the planet, the bulk of the deep sea will probably remain relatively unimpacted by human activities and climate change in the year 2025. However, increased pressure on terrestrial resources will certainly lead to an expansion of direct human activities in the deep sea, and to direct and indirect environmental impacts. Because so little is known about this remote environment, the deep-sea ecosystem may well be substantially modified before its natural state is fully understood.

AB  - Human activities are significantly altering nutrient regimes and the abundance of consumers in coastal ecosystems. A field experiment in an open-coast, upwelling ecosystem showed that small increases in nutrients increased the biomass and evenness of tide pool macrophytes where consumer abundance and nutrient loading rates were low. Consumers, when abundant, had negative effects on the diversity and biomass of macrophytes. Nutrient loading increases and consumers are less abundant and efficient as wave exposure increases along open coastlines. Experimentally reversing the natural state of nutrient supply and consumer pressure at a wave-protected site to match wave-exposed sites caused the structure of the macrophyte assemblage to converge on that found naturally in wave-exposed pools. The increases in evenness and abundance were driven by increases in structurally complex functional groups. In contrast, increased nutrient loading in semienclosed marine or estuarine ecosystems is typically associated with declines in macrophyte diversity because of increases in structurally simple and opportunistic functional groups. If nutrient concentration of upwelled waters changes with climatic warming or increasing frequency of El Niños, as predicted by some climate models, these results suggest that macrophyte abundance and evenness along wave-swept open-coasts will also change. Macrophytes represent a significant fraction of continental shelf production and provide important habitat for many marine species. The combined effects of shifting nutrient regimes and overexploitation of consumers may have unexpected consequences for the structure and functioning of open-coast communities.

AB  - Interest in the quality and health of soil has been stimulated by recent awareness that soil is vital to both production of food and fiber and global ecosystems function. Soil health, or quality, can be broadly defined as the capacity of a living soil to function, within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and animal health. Soil quality and health change over time due to natural events or human impacts. They are enhanced by management and land-use decisions that weigh the multiple functions of soil and are impaired by decisions which focus only on single functions, such as crop productivity. Criteria for indicators of soil quality and health relate mainly to their utility in defining ecosystem processes and in integrating physical, chemical, and biological properties; their sensitivity to management and climatic variations; and their accessibility and utility to agricultural specialists, producers, conservationists, and policy makers. Although soils have an inherent quality as related to their physical, chemical, and biological properties within the constraints set by climate and ecosystems, the ultimate determinant of soil quality and health is the land manager. As such, the assessment of soil quality or health, and direction of change with time, is the primary indicator of sustainable management. Scientists can make a significant contribution to sustainable land management by translating scientific knowledge and information on soil function into practical tools and approaches by which land managers can assess the sustainability of their management practices. The first steps, however, in our communal journey towards sustainable land management must be the identification of our final destination (sustainability goals), the strategies or course by which we will get there, and the indicators (benchmarks) that we are proceeding in the right direction. We too often rush to raise the sails of our 'technological' ship to catch the wind, before knowing from where it comes or in properly defining our destination, charting our course, and setting the rudder of our ship. Examples are given of approaches for assessing soil quality and health to define the sustainability of land management practices and to 'translate our science into practice'. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Management of trees in agroecosystems such as agroforestry, ethnoforests, and trees outside forests can mitigate green house gas (GHG) emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. Agroforestry systems are a better climate change mitigation option than oceanic, and other terrestrial options because of the secondary environmental benefits such as helping to attain food security and secure land tenure in developing countries, increasing farm income, restoring and maintaining above-ground and below-ground biodiversity, corridors between protected forests, as CH4 sinks, maintaining watershed hydrology, and soil conservation. Agroforestry also mitigates the demand for wood and reduces pressure on natural forests. Promoting woodcarving industry facilitates long-term locking-up of carbon in carved wood and new sequestration through intensified tree growing. By making use of local knowledge, equity, livelihood security, trade and industry, can be supported. There is need to support development of suitable policies, assisted by robust country-wide scientific studies aimed at better understanding the potential of agroforestry and ethnoforestry for climate change mitigation and human well-being. © 2002 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Health is a focus reflecting the combined impacts of climate change on the physical environment, ecosystems, the economic environment and society. Long-term changes in the world's climate may affect many requisites of good health - sufficient food, safe and adequate drinking water and secure dwelling. The current large-scale social and environmental changes mean that we must assign a much higher priority to population health in the policy debate on climate change. Climate change will affect human health and wellbeing through a variety of mechanisms. Climate change can adversely impact on the availability of flesh water supply and the efficiency of local sewerage systems. It is also likely to affect food security. Cereal yields are expected to increase at high and mid latitudes but decrease at lower latitudes. Changes in food production are likely to significantly affect health in Africa. In addition, the distribution and seasonal transmission of several vector-borne infectious diseases (such as malaria and dengue) may be affected by climate change. Altered distribution of some vector species may be among the early signals of climate change. A change in the world climate could increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. The impacts on health of natural disasters are considerable - the number of people killed, injured or made homeless from such causes is increasingly alarming. The vulnerability of people living in risk-prone areas is an important contributor to disaster casualties and damage. An increase in heatwaves (and possibly air pollution) will be a problem in urban areas, where excess mortality and morbidity is currently observed during hot weather episodes. We can assume that climate change will affect the most vulnerable in developing countries. These might be socio-economic deprived populations, people who lack access to a health care system, technology and communication, as well as immuno compromised persons. The health community has, however, difficulties in clearly attributing changes in ranges of diseases or mortality to climatic changes. The main reasons are the gradual process of climate change, the multiple causes of diseases, the many factors that permit human population health to adapt and the lack of retrospective and prospective studies from developing countries. Adaptation is a key response strategy to minimise potential impacts of climate change. A primary objective of adaptation is the reduction, with the least cost, of death, disease, disability and human suffering. The ability to adapt to climate change impacts, and specifically of health, will depend on many factors including existing infrastructure, resources, technology, information and the level of equity in different countries and regions.

AB  - Large mammalian herbivores occupy half of the earth's land surface and are important both ecologically and economically1, but their diversity is threatened by human activities2. We investigated how the diversity of large herbivores changes across gradients of global precipitation and soil fertility. Here we show that more plant-available moisture reduces the nutrient content of plants but increases productivity, whereas more plant-available nutrients increase both of these factors. Because larger herbivore species tolerate lower plant nutrient content but require greater plant abundance, the highest potential herbivore diversity should occur in locations with intermediate moisture and high nutrients. These areas are dry enough to yield high quality plants and support smaller herbivores, but productive enough to support larger herbivores. These predictions fit with observed patterns of body size and diversity for large mammalian herbivores in North America, Africa and Australia, and yield a global map of regions with potentially high herbivore diversity. Thus, gradients of precipitation, temperature and soil fertility might explain the global distribution of large herbivore diversity and help to identify crucial areas for conservation and restoration.

AB  - Human society has used freshwater from rivers, lakes, groundwater, and wetlands for many different urban, agricultural, and industrial activities, but in doing so has overlooked its value in supporting ecosystems. Freshwater is vital to human life and societal well-being, and thus its utilization for consumption, irrigation, and transport has long taken precedence over other commodities and services provided by freshwater ecosystems. However, there is growing recognition that functionally intact and biologically complex aquatic ecosystems provide many economically valuable services and long-term benefits to society. The short-term benefits include ecosystem goods and services, such as food supply, flood control, purification of human and industrial wastes, and habitat for plant and animal life - and these are costly, if not impossible, to replace. Long-term benefits include the sustained provision of those goods and services, as well as the adaptive capacity of aquatic ecosystems to respond to future environmental alterations, such as climate change. Thus, maintenance of the processes and properties that support freshwater ecosystem integrity should be included in debates over sustainable water resource allocation. The purpose of this report is to explain how the integrity of freshwater ecosystems depends upon adequate quantity, quality, timing, and temporal variability of water flow. Defining these requirements in a comprehensive but general manner provides a better foundation for their inclusion in current and future debates about allocation of water resources. In this way the needs of freshwater ecosystems can be legitimately recognized and addressed. We also recommend ways in which freshwater ecosystems can be protected, maintained, and restored. Freshwater ecosystem structure and function are tightly linked to the watershed or catchment of which they are a part. Because riverine networks, lakes, wetlands, and their connecting groundwaters, are literally the "sinks" into which landscapes drain, they are greatly influenced by terrestrial processes, including many human uses or modifications of land and water. Freshwater ecosystems, whether lakes, wetlands, or rivers, have specific requirements in terms of quantity, quality, and seasonality of their water supplies. Sustainability normally requires these systems to fluctuate within a natural range of variation. Flow regime, sediment and organic matter inputs, thermal and light characteristics, chemical and nutrient characteristics, and biotic assemblages are fundamental defining attributes of freshwater ecosystems. These attributes impart relatively unique characteristics of productivity and biodiversity to each ecosystem. The natural range of variation in each of these attributes is critical to maintaining the integrity and dynamic potential of aquatic ecosystems; therefore, management should allow for dynamic change. Piecemeal approaches cannot solve the problems confronting freshwater ecosystems. Scientific definitions of the requirements to protect and maintain aquatic ecosystems are necessary but insufficient for establishing the appropriate distribution between societal and ecosystem water needs. For scientific knowledge to be implemented science must be connected to a political agenda for sustainable development. We offer these recommendations as a beginning to redress how water is viewed and managed in the United States: (1) Frame national and regional water management policies to explicitly incorporate freshwater ecosystem needs, particularly those related to naturally variable flow regimes and to the linking of water quality with water quantity; (2) Define water resources to include watersheds, so that freshwaters are viewed within a landscape, or systems context; (3) Increase communication and education across disciplines, especially among engineers, hydrologists, economists, and ecologists to facilitate an integrated view of freshwater resources; (4) Increase restoration efforts, using well-grounded ecological principles as guidelines; (5) Maintain and protect the remaining freshwater ecosystems that have high integrity; and (6) Recognize the dependence of human society on naturally functioning ecosystems.

AB  - It is now widely accepted that biodiversity is the measure of biological variety at many scales, from the gene to the ecosystem. Much attention has been given to diversity of species within forests, especially trees that are being harvested. The challenge is to see the forest for the trees: How can the idea of biodiversity at the ecosystem level be translated into practical action for better management of forest ecosystems? The definition of "ecosystem" is reasonably well agreed. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) defines the term as "a dynamic complex of plant, animal and micro-organism communities and their non-living environment interacting as a functional unit". The living components of an ecosystem interact in very complex food webs (Schoener, 1989). Ecosystem approaches to forest management take into consideration the complexity of these interactions and seek both to maintain the productivity of forest ecosystems and to enhance their capacity to adapt to change. Focusing on the ecosystem level provides a strong basis for solving critical problems in resource management. For example, conserving forest biodiversity at the ecosystem level helps to support services such as maintaining the balance of atmospheric gases, recycling nutrients, regulating climate, maintaining hydrological cycles and creating soil (Daily, 1997). While scientists are still developing their understanding of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, productivity, stability and adaptability of ecosystems, new research indicates that species diversity enhances the productive capacity of many forest ecosystems and their ability to adapt to changing conditions (Johnson et al., 1996). Another important implication of considering forest biodiversity at the ecosystem level is the potential of mismanagement leading to the essentially permanent transformation of a highly productive forest into a much less productive system (such as a grassland). Recent research has indicated that even gradual changes in climate, the flow of nutrients, extraction of natural resources and habitat fragmentation can lead to sudden drastic switches in the character of a forest ecosystem (Scheffer et al., 2001). While many different factors can lead to such shifts, a critical factor is a loss of resilience (the ability to recover from external events) through declining biodiversity at the ecosystem level. In seeking to apply ecosystem approaches to forest biodiversity, especially forests that are being influenced by increasing levels of use by people, it is helpful to focus on some key questions. First, are people part of forest ecosystems? Second, what are the impacts of human harvesting on forest ecosystems? Third, how can forest ecosystems be managed so that they provide both the goods and the services that are required by modern society? This article briefly explores these key issues, and indicates appropriate lines of action to be taken in future.

AB  - Agricultural production in Turkey is not sustainable due to degradation and loss of croplands, rapid population growth, and inequitable economic growth (poverty and overconsumption). Degrading land uses and management practices disturb the life-supporting biogeochemical cycles within croplands and between croplands and natural ecosystems by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs: CO2, CH4, N2O, CFCs, and tropospheric O3), pollution of water, soil and air, loss of soil organic matter and biodiversity, erosion, salinization and desertification. Sustainability-oriented management practices in croplands include maintenance of soil organic matter by conservation tillage and residue management, windbreaks, selection of crops ecologically adapted to local climate regimes, effecient crop rotation, enhancement of agrobiodiversity (e.g. intercropping and agroforestry), and adoption of proper drainage techniques. Implementation of these preventive and mitigative measures necessitates internalization of ecological principles into agricultural policy and management processes. This study explores the opportunities and limitations of agricultural sustainability in Turkey in a holistic manner. A multiple linear regression (MLR) model was developed to relate CO2 emissions to energy intensity (energy use/gross domestic product), affluence (gross domestic product/population) and population growth. Our MLR model with a high R2 of 97 per cent revealed that stabilization of human population growth, and increasing energy efficiency in economic growth are essential to decreasing GHG emissions and enhancing environmental quality.

AB  - The global forest ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon cycle and in the preservation of biological diversity. The dissertation presents a qualitative analysis of non-sustainable civilisation-nature interaction patterns relevant for global deforestation and forest degradation. Since this problem is closely linked to other core problems of Global Change (GC), e.g. Soil Degradation, World Food security, Climate Change, etc., it is not to be tackled separately. Therefore a novel transdisciplinary approach to analyse non-sustainable civilisation nature interactions in the context of GC is utilised in the investigation. The approach rests on the decomposition of the intricate dynamics of GC into patterns of problematic civilisation nature interactions ("Syndromes") by an iterative process of observations, data and system theoretical analysis, and GIS based modelling attempts. These Syndromes characterise endangering and risky developments of civilisation nature interaction and represent a baseline for measuring and indicating 'non-sustainability' - in order to have a sustainable development it is necessary to have a far-reaching absence of Syndromes. The patterns are defined as characteristic constellations of interacting socio-economic and physical phenomena ("Symptomes" of GC), which build complex dynamical systems of civilisation-nature interaction. The cause-effect schemes of Symptomes and their interrelations are constituted as complex phenomena resulting from interactions over the different spheres of the Earth System. The approach is illustrated by a detailed analysis of those civilisation nature interaction patterns relevant for global deforestation. Human activities cause a wide extent of deforestation and threaten the important role of the remaining global forest within the earth system. Global deforestation and forest degradation is made up by a limited number of cause effect patterns observed in different parts of the world. The main syndromes identified causing large scale deforestation are: • The overexploitation of natural ecosystems - the Overexploitation Syndrome. Examples of this pattern are the exploitation of forests for timber or fuelwood and charcoal. • The rural poverty driven overuse of natural resources - the Sahel Syndrome. Examples are the exploitation of forests via slash and burn cultivation by smallholders, particular in tropical developing countries. • Non-sustainable agro-industrial use of soils and bodies of water - the Dust Bowl Syndrome. Examples are the conversion of forest for large cattle farming or cash crop agriculture. Besides these mayor cause-effect schemes of global deforestation, there are several other Syndromes that contribute on a minor scale, e.g. the development and destruction of nature for recreational ends (Mass Tourism Syndrome), the environmental damage of natural landscapes as a result of large-scale projects like dams (Aral Sea Syndrome), the environmental degradation related to mining and extraction of non-renewable resources (Katanga Syndrome) or the environmental degradation through large-scale diffusion of long-lived substances (Smokestack Syndrome) as in the case of acid rain. The geographical analysis of a Syndrome is performed in several steps integrating GIS with concepts of fuzzy logic and qualitative reasoning. In the first step a syndrome specific network of interactions is formulated by analysing case studies, theories and expert assessments. Based on this systemic representation the natural and socio-economic conditions under which the syndrome specific mechanisms can be active are identified. This evaluation is called the disposition of a region towards a specific Syndrome. The resulting indicator can be used as an early warning indicator for the possible germination of a non-sustainable development. Based on the constituting elements of the Syndrome, a complex indicator for the intensity of the active Syndrome is derived in the next step of the analysis. This indicator assesses the critical states in the dynamical evolution of the non-sustainable patterns of civilisation nature interaction. Complete Syndrome analyses are performed for the main Syndromes of deforestation. The resulting spatial distribution of the combined dispositions and intensities of the different Syndromes present a unique global assessment describing the current damage and future regional threats to forests by their underlying global cause-effect patterns of civilisation-nature interaction. Specially the assessment of the threat by coupling of momentarily active and potentially active cause-effect patterns provides a previously not achieved systematic insight into the complex interaction of different patterns of global deforestation and forest degradation.

AB  - Authors present the hypothesis that freshwater fish diversity, recruitment and production depend greatly on riparian ecotones. These boundary environments are usually the most diverse elements of aquatic systems. Riparian ecotones moderate the transfer of energy and materials from the land, provide a high load of organic matter including invertebrate food, and moderate competition and predation among animals living in them. Riparian ecotones provide feeding places and shelter for fish, and are particularly important for their reproduction and earliest life-history stages. The complexity and biological importance of riparian ecotones depend on the extent to which the system is self-regulating, which depends in turn on geology, physiography, climate, vegetation, human activity and the age of the system. By changing riparian ecotone character, fish density can be regulated through controlling reproduction and recruitment, and energy flow through the food chain can be controlled for management of water quality.

AB  - Trends in water consumption indicate that demand for water for household and industrial uses in developing countries could double as a proportion of total water demand in the next 25 years. Scope for expansion of water supply will, at the same time, be limited because development of irrigation and urban water supplies is becoming increasingly expensive, and often involves high costs in terms of environmental degradation and human resettlement. Without fundamental reform of water management, the rapid growth in urban water demand will require large transfers of water from irrigated agriculture, thereby threatening food security. Hence, water supply and demand should be managed in an integrated fashion, simultaneously considering all uses and sources. This will call for the establishment of community centred food and water security systems and national water trusts. Once such systems and Trusts are established there could be a legally binding Global Water Convention on the model of the Global Convention on Climate and Biodiversity. The details of such a Global Water Conventions can be finalized at one of the future Stockholm Water Symposia. There are uncommon opportunities today for a water-secure world through synergy between technology, public policy and peoples' participation.

AB  - The World Development Report 1999/2000, the 22nd in this annual series, addresses the changing development landscape of the early 21st century. Development thinking has evolved into a broad pragmatism, realizing that development must move beyond economic growth to encompass important social goals - reduced poverty, improved quality of life, enhanced opportunities for better education and health, and more. Experience has also taught that sustainable progress toward these goals requires integrated implementation and must be firmly anchored in processes that are open, participatory, and inclusive. In the absence of a strong institutional foundation, the outcomes of good policy initiatives tend to dissipate. These lessons and insights are incorporated into the Comprehensive Development Framework, recently initiated by the World Bank to address the challenges of development in a more holistic, integrated way by bringing in aspects such as governance, legal institutions, and financial institutions, which were too often given short shrift earlier. Looking ahead, this report explores the environment in which the major issues of the 21st century - poverty, population growth, food security, water scarcity, climate change, cultural preservation - will be faced. Many powerful forces, both glacial and fast-paced, are reshaping the development landscape. These include innovations in technology, the spread of information and knowledge, the aging of populations, the financial interconnections of the world, and the rising demands for political and human rights. The report focuses in particular on two clusters of change - globalization and localization - because of their immense potential impact. They open up unprecedented opportunities for growth and development, but they also carry with them the threats of economic and political instability that can erode years of hard-earned gains.

AB  - During the 17th and 18th centuries, tens of thousands of Greenland right whales were killed as a result of extensive European whaling in the coastal waters of the Svalbard archipelago. The author reconstructed these whaling activities, examined how the changing climate affected whaling productivity, and considered the consequences of climate and whaling on the species and on the North Atlantic ecosystem. Annual catch records made it possible to calculate the original size of the whale population; its natural migration pattern in the Greenland Sea could be reconstructed using shipping logs and itineraries. Other written sources revealed that besides human hunting activities, climate change played an important role in the elimination of the Greenland right whale from the Arctic marine ecosystem. This elimination made millions of plankton available for other marine mammals, polar cod and plankton-feeding birds. This has caused a major shift in the food web, changing the marine ecosystem in Svalbard.

AB  - Rice is a staple food for about 2.4 billion people all over the world and accounts for more than 23% of the total per capita daily calorie intake. In South and South-east Asia, 35-79 of the per capita daily calorie intake comes from rice alone. To meet the projected demand, it is estimated that rice production must increase from the current level of about 520 million tones to 880 million dtones by 2025. With the ever-increasing growth rate in population especially in South and South-east Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, continued degradation of resource base and decline in suspport of agricultural research, the task does not seem to be easy. Moreover, the challenge is not only to produce more, but to produce more rice on less land wit less water, less pesticide use and less labour. In addition, rice in some circles, is being condemned as the major culprit for the global warming, climate change, and environmental degradation, although these changes are also a threat to rice production itself. Decline in total factor productivity especially in long and intensive rice-rice and rice-wheat cropping systems, increased use of pesticides and their adverse impact on soil, water, animal and human health, erosion of genetic diversity etc. are cited as examples. It is a fact that in quest of producing more, the high yielding varieties are fast replacing the landraces, the storehouse of valued and rare genes. Similarly, the intensive rice cultivation has led to poor soil-health and water-quality resulting into yield decline even with higher inputs use. Question, therefore, is as how to plan for the increased production of rice on a sustainable basis without having any adverse effects on the environment, in general, and on the resource base in particular. The paper analyses the current scenarios and outlines the strategies for a balance approach to avoid any conflict between food security through increased rice production and sustainability of resource-base and global climate.

AB  - During the past four decades the authors perceive that an increasing non-sustainability (Disintegration) within the agriculture, human nutrition, waste management complex has occurred both in Germany and the European Union. Compared to the basic needs of the population for nutritive energy, fat and protein, we estimate that the production and consumption of food and feed is more than 50% higher than necessary. Using nitrogen (N) input into German agriculture in 1991/92 as an example, we estimated that the N input of 191 kg ha-1 was 2 to 3 times too high. This high N input resulted in the net biomass production of 45 kg ha-1, a 25% efficiency. This inefficiency causes emissions of reactive N and other nutrient compounds into the hydrosphere and atmosphere that were 2 to 8 times too high. For example the contributions of agriculture to the total annual N2O-N emissions of Germany (during 1990-1992), Europe (1990) and of the world (1989) were 110, 691 Gg and 6.7 Tg or 52, 62 and 41%, respectively. The authors demonstrate that emissions of N and P from Germany and EU waste water management systems are also higher than necessary because nutrient recycling is not practiced extensively. Excessive food production and consumption has made the agriculture/human nutrition/waste and waste water complex, like the energy/transportation complex, a main cause of new transboundary environmental damage such as soil and water acidification, hypertrophication of near-natural terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and climate change. We propose that a sustainable food production/consumption system can be developed that is based both on need-oriented production and consumption with no net exports and on recovery, recycling and more efficient use of nutrients. Using N as an example, the authors show which short and long term action aims must be set and realized by the year 2015, to meet environmental, economical and social sustainability requisites. The suggested, assumed sustainable N balance for German agriculture is characterized by a critical annual input and surplus maximum of 80 and 45 kg N ha-1 respectively, which should almost double biomass production efficiency for N utilization. This estimate is based on reducing animal stocking rates to 0.5 gross weight unit ha-1 to attain no net mineralization or immobilization of N in the soil.

AB  - Considerable attention has been devoted to monitoring heavy metals in temperate zones of the world, largely due to the concentration of industries and populations in these regions. With increases in global transport of mercury, it has become important to examine the effects of mercury on components of tropical ecosystems, and to design biomonitoring schemes to assess environmental changes involving mercury. Tropical ecosystems differ from temperate ones in fundamental ways, including increased species diversity, and decreased niche width, spatial heterogeneity, food web lengths and complexity, productivity and soil laterization. Because of these differences, the fate and transport of mercury may differ in temperate and tropical systems, and it is suggested in this paper that bird feathers be used as a biomonitoring tool to assess broad-scale trends in mercury exposure, as well as being indicative of adverse effects on the birds themselves. In many ecosystems, some species of birds occupy top trophic levels. It is apparent that the mercury level in feathers of some tropical birds are as high as those from temperature regions, exceeding levels associated with adverse effects in laboratory studies.

AB  - The "green revolution" was desirable because of increased crop yields, but 25 years later after the results of land degradation, groundwater contamination, and environmentally harmful practices were revealed, there is a return to sustainable agriculture. The aim is to minimize agriculture's harmful effects on the environment and to maintain water ad soil resources. Present and future food production depends on suitable land, water, climate, and finances. Unfortunately, the timing is wrong. Population growth is putting pressure on farmers to increase yields. The current conditions are the 11% of the earth's vegetative land surface has diminished productivity due to human activity. There is loss of biodiversity and genetic material. CAttle grazing is inefficient and adds to desertification; animal waste contributes to pollution. Pesticides and fertilizers are the largest US water pollutants. Sustainable agriculture means new tilling methods, reducing pesticide use, and crop rotation. The National Research Council in 1989 reported on alternative agriculture: 1) making the most of natural biological processes; 2) reducing or eliminating pesticides and other chemicals; 3) conserving soil, water, and energy; and 4) matching crops with land to ensure sustainable production levels. Reeducation is needed. Operation SAVE (Sustainable Agriculture that's Voluntary and Economical) produces an annual directory and guide for farmers adopting new methods. Land trusts and conservation easements are being established to preserve farmland. Reclamation of degraded land is being promoted by distribution of tree seedlings to developing countries. Community supported agriculture groups share in the cost of raising crops and receive organic, fresh produce. There are fears about economic feasibility. Conventional farmers argue for pesticide use to increase yields, but a Cornell University study refutes this for organically grown corn. High technology research is not likely to yield a new variety of seed before 2000. Research is needed for poor subsistence farmers. Food distribution is not a problem if everyone is vegetarian. Global warming could also precipitously change climate and affect crops. Population growth will play a significant role in determining the outcome of the world's struggle to feed people and protect the planet.

AB  - Several government agencies are evaluating policy options for addressing global climate change. These include planning for anticipated effects and developing mitigation options where feasible if climate does change as predicted. For fisheries resources, policy questions address effects on international, national, and regional scales. Climate change variables expected to affect inland and offshore fisheries include temperature rise, changes in the hydrologic cycle, alterations in nutrient fluxes, and reduction and relocation of spawning and nursery habitat. These variables will affect resources at all levels of biological organization, including the genetic, organism, population, and ecosystem levels. In this context, changes in primary productivity, species composition in the food-web, migration, invasions, synchrony in biological cycles, shifts in utilization of niches, and problems of larvae entrainment in estuaries have been identified. Maintaining ecosystem robustness (i.e., high biodiversity) is another component of the problem. Action requires establishing priorities for information needs, determining appropriate temporal and spatial scales at which to model effects, and accounting for interactive changes in physical and biological cycles. A policy response can be derived when these results are integrated with social needs and human population constraints. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
