Various water harvesting techniques are used by farmers to reduce the impact of climate variability, but are not sufficient in the case of a prolonged drought lasting 2–3 weeks. The farmers believe supplemental irrigation is a good way to adapt rainfed agriculture to dry spells. In this study, we evaluated the food contribution and profitability of supplemental irrigation of rainfed crops comparing various farm ponds that collect runoff water from the surrounding landscape. Methods: We analyzed the contribution of supplemental irrigation to food security and compared the profitability of different types of ponds constructed by farmers in northern Burkina Faso. Human cereal requirement was used as indicators to analyze the contribution of supplemental irrigation to food security. The criteria for analyzing the profitability of the selected ponds were gross margin (GM), net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and payback period (PBP). Results: Our results show that the additional yield of corn obtained with supplemental irrigation makes it possible to meet the monthly cereal needs of at least 17 people and generates an additional GM of FCFA 178,483 (US$ 309.26) compared to no irrigation. The estimate of the NPV, from IRR and PBP showed that the profitability of supplemental irrigation in 15 agricultural seasons varies between the type of ponds constructed. Conclusions: Given the up-front cost and the farmers’ lack of resources, the ponds require a subsidy or a credit policy to facilitate the adoption of supplemental irrigation in Sahelian countries. However, the irrigation strategies to optimize agricultural income remain a field of research to be explored. © 2022, The Author(s).","Cereal need; Dry spells; Profitability; Rainfed agriculture; Runoff water",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123101625

Due to the extreme humanitarian situation, the effects on the environment have been overlooked. However, due to the intense fighting, the impacts will be dramatic and produce an environmental disaster. The war is already affecting areas beyond Ukraine (explosions in Russia and Moldova territory). This discussion paper aims to shed light on the potential effect of this vast conflict on the ecosystems and their services. Although the war is still ongoing, there is evidence of severe air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the intense fights. Also, warfare activities were conducted in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (the biggest in Europe) and Chernobyl, increasing the fear of radiation leaks. The biodiversity is being drastically affected due to intense deforestation and habitat destruction with potential implications for wildlife. Bombing, trench and tunnel excavations will likely negatively impact soil degradation and landscape morphology. This assumes particular importance since Ukraine has some of the most fertile soils globally (Chernozem), affecting food production. Water availability and quality are likely to be affected due to infrastructure destruction and the transport of pollutants to water reserves. The ecosystem services supplied will likely be strongly damaged since deforestation will decrease the capacity of the ecosystems to regulate air pollution or climate. Soil degradation will hamper food production, and landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage and social cohesion destruction drastically affects cultural services. Finally, the impacts on human health are already tremendous. However, it can be even higher due to exposure to high levels of contamination and sanitary conditions degradation. The war is still ongoing, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the impacts. However, we may expect a dramatic effect on the total environment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Environment; Russian Ukrainian war; Soil; Water",,Note,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130577677

However, current agroecosystem management lacks the support of high-resolution crop-type-specific HANPP information. To this end, this study integrated multi-source data of crop type, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series, irrigation and climate, and multiple methods of the Miami model, the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, and process parameters to map the 30-m resolution spatial distribution of agroecosystem HANPP in the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in 2007 and 2012. We then analyzed the influences of climate condition, irrigation, and crop type on the HANPP. The average HANPP in the HRB decreased from 762.4 to 712.1 g C/m2 from 2007 to 2012, with a decrease by 6.6%. The HANPP values of wheat, barley, and oilseed rape decreased by more than 10.0%, whereas that of corn only decreased by 3.1%. The ratio of HANPP to potential NPP (NPPpot) dropped from 82.7% to 81.4% and that of land-use-induced HANPP (HANPPLUC) to HANPP from 61.9% to 58.5%, whereas that of crop-harvest-induced HANPP (HANPPharv) to HANPP increased from 38.1% to 41.5%. These changes indicated that crop productivity increased whereas NPP loss decreased. Crop type conversion accounted for 84.7% of the HANPP changes in HRB, with a value of −93.6 × 109 g C. Due to irrigation supplementation, the HANPP in high-temperature areas was higher than that in low-temperature areas with high precipitation. However, irrigation above 1000 mm no longer promoted HANPP, indicating that the irrigation efficiency in the HRB is low. Reducing HANPPLUC and carbon-water inputs while increasing HANPPharv is the key approach to obtain food security and sustainable agroecosystem development. Effective irrigation strategies and scientific crop planting adjustment should take into account their spatially heterogeneous and crop-specific impacts on the HANPP to help achieve these goals. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Crop-type-specific HANPP; Food-ecological security; Human appropriation of net primary production; Remote sensing; Spatially heterogeneous impacts; Sustainable agroecosystem development","agricultural ecosystem; food security; mapping method; NDVI; net primary production; remote sensing; spatial distribution; sustainable development; China; Gansu; Hei River",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129738199

Here, we examine the sources of uncertainty in drought assessment using multiple observational and future projections datasets, methods, and hydrological models. Moreover, we discuss potential ways to overcome the challenges associated with drought assessment in India. The drought assessment without considering uncertainty may cause overestimation or underestimation of risk in the observed and projected future climate, which further affects the planning and management of water resources.

One of the most abundant, diverse and impactful parts of this microbiome is arguably fungal spores. They can be very potent outdoor aeroallergens and pathogens, causing an enormous socio-economic burden on health services and annual damages to crops costing billions of Euros. We find through hypothesis testing that an expected warmer and drier climate has a dramatic impact on the atmospheric microbiome, conceivably through alteration of the hydrological cycle impacting agricultural systems, with significant differences in leaf wetness between years (p-value <0.05). The data were measured via high-throughput sequencing analysis using the DNA barcode marker, ITS2. This was complemented by remote sensing analysis of land cover and dry matter productivity based on the Sentinel satellites, on-site detection of atmospheric and vegetation variables, GIS analysis, harvesting analysis and footprint modelling on trajectory clusters using the atmospheric transport model HYSPLIT. We find the seasonal spore composition varies between rural and urban zones reflecting both human activities (e.g. harvest), type and status of the vegetation and the prevailing climate rather than mesoscale atmospheric transport. We find that crop harvesting governs the composition of the atmospheric microbiome through a clear distinction between harvest and post-harvest beta-diversity by PERMANOVA on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (p-value <0.05). Land cover impacted significantly by two-way ANOVA (p-value <0.05), while there was minimal impact from air mass transport over the 3 years. The hypothesis suggests that the fungal spore composition will change dramatically due to climate change, an until now unforeseen effect affecting both food security, human health and the atmospheric hydrological cycle. Consequently the management of crop diseases and impact on human health through aeroallergen exposure need to consider the timing of crop treatments and land management, including post harvest, to minimize exposure of aeroallergens and pathogens. © 2022","eDNA; GIS; HYSPLIT; Metabarcoding; Remote sensing; Spores","Climate change; Crops; DNA sequences; Food supply; Fungi; Gene encoding; Geographic information systems; Harvesting; Health; Urban transportation; Vegetation; Aeroallergens; EDNA; Fungal spores; HYSPLIT; Land cover; Metabarcoding; Microbiome; P-values; Remote-sensing; Spore; Remote sensing; internal transcribed spacer 2; aerosol; climate change; climate effect; DNA; fungus; GIS; remote sensing; Sentinel; spore; air mass transport; airborne fungus; Article; atmospheric microbiome; atmospheric transport; biomass production; climate change; climate warming; DNA barcoding; environmental parameters; food security; fungal plant disease; fungus spore; geographic information system; harvest; health status; high throughput sequencing; human; human activities; land use; leaf wetness; microbial diversity; microbiome; nonhuman; pathogen load; plant damage; plant parameters; postharvest period; remote sensing; seasonal variation; socioeconomics; telecommunication; urban rural difference; vegetation; water cycle",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127217631

In the Brazilian portion of the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB) that encompasses the Pantanal, one of the largest tropical wetlands in the world, in addition to the high biodiversity found there, fisheries are an important ecosystem service mostly supported by migratory fishes. We estimated the current range of migratory fish of commercial interest, also assessing the climate change effects predicted on the distribution patterns. Then, we assessed the effects of future climate on fish richness, and combining species ranges with routes blocked by artificial dams investigated possible impacts on fishery and food security in the UPRB. Climate change will induce range contraction between 47% and 100% for the species analyzed, and only four migratory fish may have suitable habitat until the end-of-century. The local richness will reduce about 85% in the basin. River fragmentation by dams acting together with climate change will prevent upstream shifts for most fish species. About 4% of present range and up to 45% of future range of migratory fish should be blocked by dams in UPRB.

The outlined climate and environmental history of the coastal and continental zones of southern Primorye, based mainly on vegetation reconstructions derived from the study of fossil pollen from sedimentary deposits from various archives, is compared with the archaeological cultural sequence of the region. This shows synchronicity between several phases of climate change and cultural transition, migration and changes in population numbers and/or subsistence strategies. The pronounced warming trend during the Early Holocene (Preboreal and Boreal stages) is associated with increasing numbers of long-term camp sites of the Late Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers and a growing importance of aquatic food resources. The Holocene maximum temperature and moisture conditions during the Atlantic stage were paralleled by the emergence and flourishing of the Neolithic Rudnaya, Vetka and Boisman cultures (ca. 7.7–5.5 14C ka BP/8.5–6.2 cal ka BP). The latter was a specialised maritime forager culture distributed along the Sea of Japan coast, which likely reflects climate conditions and sea water temperatures that promoted a broad spectrum of marine food resources. Towards the end of the Atlantic stage, sea levels decreased and transformed the coastal landscape of southern Primorye, which probably contributed to the decline of the Boisman culture. At the same time, the climate started to become cooler, which is likely related to the eastward migration of Zaisanovskaya culture groups from more continental (cooler) regions to milder southern Primorye. Continuous cooling during the Subboreal was accompanied by further immigrations of Zaisanovskaya people and an increase in millet cultivation, which probably occurred in the region between ca. 4.6–4.1 14C ka BP/5.3–4.6 cal ka BP. With the emergence of the Palaeometal Epoch cultures (ca. 3.6 14C ka BP/4.0 cal ka BP), food production diversified (growing number of cultivated crops, animal husbandry) and intensified, which probably decreased the people's dependence on climatic conditions unfavourable for food procurement. However, the maximum flourishing (ca. 2.8–2.6 14C ka BP/2.9–2.6 cal ka BP) of the Palaeometal Epoch Yankovskaya culture, represented by a maximum number of documented settlement sites in Primorye's prehistoric sequence, was likely related to a coeval short phase of climate amelioration with higher air and sea water temperatures and an increased sea level, which promoted agriculture and a higher productivity of coastal waters. © 2022 The Authors","Archaeological sites; Cultural shifts; Human population dynamics; Palaeoclimate; Sea of Japan level; Vegetation change",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125451735

Under these conditions, shifting to substitute crops with minor water necessities, abiotic stress tolerance, greater yield, or biological substance per unit of water is critical for long-lasting farming. With its dual purposes implications like a staple food for humans and a major feed crop for animal feeding, sorghum can adjust to a diversity of agronomic and environmental circumstances, principally little precipitation, inadequate irrigation water availability, and salinity.

It is a global threat that has embarked on to put stress on various sectors. This study is aimed to conceptually engineer how climate variability is deteriorating the sustainability of diverse sectors worldwide. Specifically, the agricultural sector’s vulnerability is a globally concerning scenario, as sufficient production and food supplies are threatened due to irreversible weather fluctuations. In turn, it is challenging the global feeding patterns, particularly in countries with agriculture as an integral part of their economy and total productivity. Climate change has also put the integrity and survival of many species at stake due to shifts in optimum temperature ranges, thereby accelerating biodiversity loss by progressively changing the ecosystem structures. Climate variations increase the likelihood of particular food and waterborne and vector-borne diseases, and a recent example is a coronavirus pandemic. Climate change also accelerates the enigma of antimicrobial resistance, another threat to human health due to the increasing incidence of resistant pathogenic infections. Besides, the global tourism industry is devastated as climate change impacts unfavorable tourism spots. The methodology investigates hypothetical scenarios of climate variability and attempts to describe the quality of evidence to facilitate readers’ careful, critical engagement. Secondary data is used to identify sustainability issues such as environmental, social, and economic viability. To better understand the problem, gathered the information in this report from various media outlets, research agencies, policy papers, newspapers, and other sources.

This timely study reports on a novel, paludiculture-based, integrated-multi-trophic-aquaculture (IMTA) system for sustainable food production in the Irish midlands. This freshwater IMTA process relies on a naturally occurring ecosystem of microalgae, bacteria and duckweed in ponds for managing waste and water quality that is powered by wind turbines; however, as it is recirculating, it does not rely upon end-of-pipe solutions and does not discharge effluent to receiving waters. This constitutes the first report on the effects of extreme weather events on the performance of this IMTA system that produces European perch (Perca fluviatilis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiis) during Spring 2020. Sampling coincided with lockdown periods of worker mobility restriction due to COVID-19 pandemic. Observations revealed that the frequency and intensity of storms generated high levels of rainfall that disrupted the algal and bacterial ecosystem in the IMTA leading to the emergence and predominance of toxic cyanobacteria that caused fish mortality. There is a pressing need for international agreement on standardized set of environmental indicators to advance paludiculture innovation that addresses climate-change and sustainability. This study describes important technical parameters for advancing freshwater aquaculture (IMTA), which can be future refined using real-time monitoring-tools at farm level to inform management decision-making based on evaluating environmental indicators and weather data. The relevance of these findings to informing global sustaining and disruptive research and innovation in paludiculture is presented, along with alignment with UN Sustainable Development goals.

However, ecosystem models are generally much better at representing top-down impacts from fishing than bottom-up impacts due to warming or changes in nutrient loading. Bottom-up processes often have to be parameterised with little data or worse still taken as a system input rather than being represented explicitly. In this study we use an end-to-end ecosystem model (StrathE2E2) for the North Sea with 18 broad functional groups, five resource pools, and representations of feeding, metabolism, reproduction, active migrations, advection, and mixing. Environmental driving data include temperature, irradiance, hydrodynamics, and nutrient inputs from rivers, atmosphere, and ocean boundaries, so the model is designed to evaluate rigorously top-down and bottom-up impacts and is ideal for looking at possible changes in energy flows and “big picture” ecosystem function. In this study we considered the impacts of warming (2 and 4°C) and various levels of fishing, by demersal and pelagic fleets, on the structure and function of the foodweb. A key aim is to demonstrate whether monitoring of broad ecosystem groups could assist in deciding whether GES was being achieved. We found that warming raised primary productivity and increased the size (total biomass) of the ecosystem. Warming raised metabolic demands on omnivorous zooplankton and reduced their abundance, thus favouring benthivorous and piscivorous demersal fish at the expense of planktivorous pelagic fish but otherwise had modest effects on energy pathways and top predators, whereas changes in fishing patterns could materially alter foodweb function and the relative outcomes for top predators. We suggest that GES should be defined in terms of an unfished state and that abundances of broad groupings and the balance between them can help to assess whether indicator outcomes were consistent with GES. Our findings underwrite the need for an ecosystem approach for the management of human activities supported by relevant monitoring. We also highlight the need to improve our basic understanding of bottom-up processes, improve their representation within models, and ensure that our ecosystem models can capture growth limitation by nitrogen and other elements, and not just food/energy uptake.

The sustainable development goals and the planetary boundaries define targets to manage this challenge. Many of these are linked to the land system, such as biodiversity, water, food, nutrients and climate, and are strongly interconnected. A key question is how measures can be designed in the context of multi-dimensional sustainability targets to exploit synergies. To address this, a nexus approach is adopted that acknowledges the interconnectedness between the important sub-systems water, land, food, and climate. This study quantifies synergies and trade-offs from ambitious interventions in different components of this water-land-fod-climate nexus at the global scale. For this purpose, a set of six harmonized scenarios is simulated with the model of agricultural production and its impact on the environment and Integrated model to assess the global environment models. The multi-model approach improves robustness of the results while shedding light on variations coming from different modelling approaches. Our results show that measures in the food component towards healthy diets with low meat consumption have synergies with all other nexus dimensions: Increased natural land improving terrestrial biodiversity (+4% to +8%), lower greenhouse gas emissions from land (-45% to -58%), reduced irrigation water withdrawals to protect or restore hydrological environmental flows (-3% to -24%), and reductions in nitrogen surpluses (-23% to -35%). Climate mitigation measures in line with the Paris Agreement have trade-offs with the water and food components of the nexus, as they adversely affect irrigation water withdrawals (+5% to +30% in 2050 compared to reference scenario) and food prices (+1% to +20%). The analysis of a scenario combining all measures reveals how certain measures are in conflict while others reinforce each other. This study provides an example of a nexus approach to scenario analysis providing input to the next generation of pathways aiming to achieve multiple dimensions of sustainable development. © 2022 The Author(s).

Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques can utilize soil-landscape information from remote sensing data to predict the spatial pattern of soil nutrients, and it is important to explore the effects of remote sensing data types on DSM. This research utilized Landsat 8 (LT), Sentinel 2 (ST), and WorldView-2 (WV) remote sensing data and employed partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to characterize the spatial pattern of soil total nitrogen (TN) in smallholder farm settings in Yellow River Basin, China. The overall relationships between TN and spectral indices from LT and ST were stronger than those from WV. Multiple red edge band-based spectral indices from ST and WV were relevant variables for TN, while there were no red band-based spectral indices from ST and WV identified as relevant variables for TN. Soil moisture and vegetation were major driving forces of soil TN spatial distribution in this area. The research also concluded that farmlands of crop rotation had relatively higher TN concentration compared with farmlands of monoculture. The soil prediction models based on WV achieved relatively lower model performance compared with those based on ST and LT. The effects of remote sensing data spectral resolution and spectral range on enhancing soil prediction model performance are higher than the effects of remote sensing data spatial resolution. Soil prediction models based on ST can provide location-specific soil maps, achieve fair model performance, and have low cost. This research suggests DSM research utilizing ST has relatively high prediction accuracy, and can produce soil maps that are fit for the spatial explicit soil management for smallholder farms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Digital soil mapping; Food security; Soil management; Soil nitrogen; Soil nutrients; Spatial prediction","Agronomy; Climate change; Farms; Food supply; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Mapping; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Support vector machines; Watersheds; Digital soil mappings; Food security; LANDSAT; Remote sensing data; Soil management; Soil nitrogen; Soil nutrients; Spatial prediction; Total nitrogen; Worldview-2; Decision trees; nitrogen; soil total nitrogen; unclassified drug; agricultural soil; food security; Landsat; least squares method; mapping; nitrogen; prediction; smallholder; soil management; soil moisture; soil nutrient; support vector machine; accuracy; Article; calibration; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; crop rotation; digital soil mapping; garlic; maize; nonhuman; partial least squares regression; peanut; precipitation; prediction; random forest; soil management; support vector machine; Triticum aestivum; agricultural land; environmental monitoring; human; river; soil; China; Environmental Monitoring; Farms; Humans; Nitrogen; Rivers; Soil",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126279601

The Peruvian upwelling system is exceptionally productive and is comprised of subsystems at different scales along the coast. We aimed to understand the differences between two shallow coastal systems along a latitudinal gradient: Sechura Bay in the north (at the convergence of Humboldt and tropical waters) and Independencia Bay in the central-south (under typical upwelling conditions). We compared their biodiversity, trophic dynamics, community energetics, resource use and underlying abiotic conditions. Our analysis revealed that over the past two decades, Sechura has shown a warming trend, while Independencia has maintained its cold water conditions. Chlorophyll concentrations have risen significantly in both systems, higher values in Sechura suggesting there is an increase in local pressures that could lead to eutrophication. Trophic models of the La Niña 07/08 period revealed that both systems are bottom-up driven with high biomass and production at the lower trophic levels, though top-down controls were also shown, particularly in Sechura. While primary productivity was similar in both systems, differences were found in the structure and size of energy flows. More cycling and higher transfer efficiency were found in Independencia, where phytoplankton-based food chains played the main role in the overall dynamic. In contrast, the detritus food chain appears to be more relevant for energy flow in Sechura. Differences in biota and flow structure relate to the systems’ environmental conditions, i.e., more diverse warm-water species in the north and mostly cold water adapted species (mainly invertebrate filter-feeders and their predators) in the central-south. Catches in both systems were dominated by the diving fisheries and comprised mostly scallops (bottom-cultured), snails and fish in Sechura, and mussels, clams, crabs and fish in Independencia. Overall, system indicators suggest that Sechura is a comparatively less developed system. Independencia shall likely maintain its general highly productive system features, whereas Sechura will continue to be more frequently disturbed by El Niño and ongoing human-driven activities, reducing its overall stability and functionality. In the context of climate change, acknowledging these differences is essential for future adaptive management regimes.

Healthy and productive soils as well as the availability of freshwater resources are critical for agricultural productivity. On the other hand, climate change and variability make the water scarcity problem even worse. Agriculture, being the biggest consumer of fresh water, is expected to be affected significantly. Yet, agriculture is expected to play a significant role in achieving greater food, and fiber needs to meet the growing global population. In addition, soil and water quality are also becoming a bigger threat to soil productivity and freshwater availability. Some portion of nutrients applied to agriculture and urban landscapes end up in runoff and leaching water that feeds streams, rivers, lakes, groundwater, etc. These excess nutrient loadings are causing soil and water quality deterioration, which could have severe impacts on human health, aquatic ecosystems, and environmental sustainability. In addition to nutrient and chemical pollutions, emerging contaminants such as heavy metals are showing an increasing trend in soil and freshwater bodies. These emerging contaminants not only impair soil quality and freshwater sources but could also get into the food chain and affect human and animal health. While growing evidence is becoming available on the increasing threats from emerging contaminants, research and understanding are still limited. This mini-review paper summarizes available research on types of emerging contaminants and their impacts on soil and water quality.

AM fungi are found in most ecosystems including rangelands currently under increasing pressures from human activities. Southern Patagonia (Argentina) is a semiarid region influenced by extensive livestock production in rangelands. There is a lack of information about the environmental conditions and functionality of AM fungi in plant species of Patagonia ecosystems associated with livestock grazing. We assessed how soil properties, climatic conditions, and grazing intensities influence the response of AM fungi colonization. We studied most palatable and representative plant species (Poa dusenii, Rytidosperma virescens, Festuca gracillima, Nardophylum bryoides, Mulguraea tridens, and Carex argentina) growing in main ecological areas of Southern Patagonia. Most of the studied plant species (except C. argentina) presented AM symbiosis. AM colonization showed a negative relationship with soil organic carbon and nitrogen and a positive relationship with soil bulk density and pH. Results suggest that plants promoted a higher root AM colonization when soil nutrients and water availability (rainfall) are limiting. Sheep stocking rates had a differential impact depending on the ecological areas and plant life forms. High grazing decreased the AM colonization in the ecological areas with palatable plant dominance, suggesting that the impacts of grazing could lead to further negative effects on the ecosystem. Moderate grazing allows to maintain higher AM colonization, which would probably benefit the aboveground production of palatable plant and, consequently, to herbivores, particularly in degraded rangelands like Patagonian steppes. This study improves the knowledge of AM association in Patagonian semiarid rangelands by increasing our understanding of the impacts of grazing on belowground ecology. This information becomes relevant for grazing sustainable management, which may contribute to food security. © 2021 The Society for Range Management","Drylands; Life strategy; Livestock; Soil characteristic; Symbiosis","aboveground production; arbuscular mycorrhiza; bulk density; climate conditions; colonization; dicotyledon; ecosystem function; environmental conditions; fungus; grazing; human activity; livestock; rangeland; sheep; soil nutrient; symbiosis; water availability; Argentina; Patagonia",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123242017

Therefore, this study is aimed at providing a generalised quantitative and qualitative synthesis of drought-related research publications from 1861 to 2019 in the Scopus database, using bibliometric and science mapping analytics. Title-speciﬁc field drought-related articles were mined and analysed for explanatory characteristics to identify different research trends, global and national interests and their contributions’. The results of the synthesis revealed a total of 26,221 articles from 45,329 authors and 3181 journals. The annual research production in drought-related research thus exhibited a 7.87% annual growth rate during this period from 1861 to 2019. Drought as a central theme witnessed a mean growth rate (MGR) of 8170% in the last 3 years (2017–2019). The prevailing topics include drought tolerance, resilience, climate change, and drought resistance, which had MGRs of 1100%, 530%, 2030% and 70% in 2017–2019, respectively. With an MGR of 1030%, remote sensing appeared to be a widespread method used in the monitoring of meteorological drought (600%), agricultural drought (730%), and hydrological drought (330%). Four trending thematic areas identified in drought-related research from 1861 to 2019 were climate change-related; physiology and biochemistry in plant/herb photosynthesis; molecular genetics and mechanisms of drought impacts (stress), tolerance and resistance in crops/plants; and emerging concept related to the circadian rhythms of biological systems in drought conditions. It also emerged from an analysis of the thematic areas that drought-related research in South Africa focused on agriculture and food-security, water-security, environmental sustainability, socioeconomics (among others) during the relevant period. © 2021","Drought; Drought resistance; Drought tolerance; Environmental sustainability; Food security; Science mapping; Water security",,Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122524593

However, the fate and consequences of aflatoxin in soil and on soil organisms providing essential ecological services remain unclear and could potentially pose a risk to soil health and productivity. The protection of soil biodiversity and ecosystem services are essential for the success of the declared United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. The focus of this study was to investigate the toxicological consequences of aflatoxins to earthworms’ survival, growth, reproduction and genotoxicity under different temperature and moisture conditions. Results indicated an insignificant effect of aflatoxin concentrations between 10 and 100 µg/kg on the survival, growth and reproduction but indicated a concentration-dependent increase in DNA damage at standard testing conditions.

It then uses systematic review methods, including the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative, to analyse 240 articles and identify adaptation characteristics of planned and autonomous responses to water scarcity across Africa. The most common impact drivers responded to are drought and participation variability. The most frequently identified actors responding to water scarcity include individuals or households (32%), local government (15%) and national government (15%), while the most common types of response are behavioural and cultural (30%), technological and infrastructural (27%), ecosystem-based (25%) and institutional (18%). Most planned responses target low-income communities (31%), women (20%), and indigenous communities (13%), but very few studies target migrants, ethnic minorities or those living with disabilities. There is a lack of coordination of planned adaptation at scale across all relevant sectors and regions, and lack of legal and institutional frameworks for their operation. Most responses to water scarcity are coping and autonomous responses that showed only minor adjustments to business-as-usual water practices, suggesting limited adaptation depth. Maladaptation is associated with one or more dimension of responses in almost 20% of articles.

Driven by needs to sustain economic performance and reduce poverty, the LMB countries are embarking on significant land use changes in the form of more hydropower dams, to satisfy growing energy demands. This pathway could lead to irreversible changes to the ecosystem of the Mekong River, if not properly managed. Given the uncertain environmental externalities and trade-offs associated with further hydropower development and operation in the LMB, this research develops four plausible scenarios of future hydropower operation, and assesses their likely impact on streamflow and instream total suspended solids and nitrate loads of the Mekong River. The findings suggest that further hydropower operations on either tributary or mainstream could result in annual and wet season flow reduction between 11 and 25% while increase dry season flows by 1 to 15%, when compared to a business-as-usual scenario. Conversely, hydropower operation on both tributary and mainstream could result in dry season flow reduction between 10 and 15%. Both instream TSS and nitrate loads are forecasted to reduce under all three scenarios by as much as 78 and 20%, respectively, compared to the business-as-usual one. These effects are predicted to magnify under extreme climate conditions with dry season flow, TSS, and nitrate levels reduced by as much as 44, 81 and 35%, respectively, during a projected extreme dry climate condition, but less severe under improved operational alternatives. With further hydropower development in the LMB being highly unavoidable, these findings can inform effective transboundary management pathways for balancing electricity generation and protection of riverine ecology, water and food security, and people livelihoods. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","eWater's source modelling framework; Lower Mekong Basin; Nitrate; Streamflow; Total suspended solids; Transboundary river basin management","Developing countries; Drought; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Hydroelectric power; Land use; Nitrates; Rivers; Stream flow; Water management; Climate condition; Dry seasons; Ewater source modeling framework; Hydro-power development; Low mekong basin; Mekong river basins; River basins; Total suspended solids; Transboundary river basin management; Transboundary rivers; Watersheds; nitrate; nitric acid derivative; electricity generation; extreme event; hydroelectric power plant; nitrate; river basin; river management; streamflow; transboundary cooperation; Article; climate; controlled study; dry season; ecosystem; extreme environment; food security; hydropower; prediction; rainy season; reduction (chemistry); river basin; stream (river); suspended particulate matter; uncertainty; climate change; ecosystem; human; river; Mekong Basin; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Humans; Nitrates; Rivers",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114247310

Liberal democracies had consolidated on conquest, slavery, racism, sexism, colonialism, raw material extraction and female exploitation. Additional burdens came from neoliberal globalization with the massive burning of fossil oil, changing the Earth's history from the Holocene toward the Anthropocene. Multiple nexus between the human and environmental system requires an epistemology from the Global South. The paper explores alternative peace paradigms enabling poor and exploited people to overcome the destructive outcomes of patriarchal violence and extractivism. Regionally and locally, they are experimenting with just, safe, equal and sustainable alternatives of free societies. Design/methodology/approach: The nexus approach focuses on system efficiency, internal and external feedbacks and allows decision-making processes with stronger cross-sectoral coordination and multi-level governance. It includes the understanding of the policy agenda and the political actors at different levels, explaining the discrimination of gender from local to global. The analysis establishes complex relations between theory and political actions, due that all actions are inherently mediated by gender. A key focus is a relationship and the outcomes of policies, where communication and collaboration at the local level grant efficient peaceful resource management with gender equity. Findings: An engendered-sustainable peace approach is culturally decentralized and may offer alternatives to the ongoing destruction process of neoliberal corporatism and violence. Drastic systemic change requires massive changes from bottom-up and top-down before 2030–2050. Global solidarity among all excluded people, especially women and girls, promotes from childhood an engendered-sustainable peace-building process, where positive feedbacks may reduce the tipping points on Earth and among humankind. Engendered-sustainable peace can mitigate the upcoming conflicts and catastrophes, limiting the negative feedbacks from abusive, selfish and destructive corporations. A greater self-regulating sustainable system with a HUGE-security could promote a decolonized, engendered and sustainable peace for everybody. Research limitations/implications: The interconnected risks are cascading across different domains, where systemic challenges have intensified conflicts and violence, due to uncertainty, instability and fragility. Cascading effects not only demand prevention for sudden disruptions (hurricanes, floods) but also for slow-ongoing processes (drought, sea-level rise, lack of water availability, etc.), which are equally or more disruptive. Women suffer differently from disasters and are prone to greater impacts on their life and livelihood. An engendered peace is limited by the deep engrained patriarchal system. Only a culture of peace with gender recognition may grant future peace and also the sustainable care of ecosystems. Practical implications: The Global South is exploring alternative ways to overcome the present violent and destructive globalization by promoting deep engrained indigenous values of Aymaras’ living well, the shell model of commanding by obeying of the Zapatistas or Bhutan’s Happiness Index. Globally, critical women and men are promoting subsistence agriculture, solidarity or gift economy, where local efforts are restoring the equilibrium between humans and nature. An engendered-sustainable peace is limiting the destructive impacts of the Anthropocene, climate change and ongoing pandemics. Social implications: An engendered-sustainable peace is culturally decentralized and offers alternatives to the ongoing destruction process of neoliberal corporatism, climate change and violence. The text explores how to overcome the present hybrid warfare with alternative HUGE security and peace from the bottom-up. Regional reinforcement of food security, safe water management, local jobs and a concordian economy for the most vulnerable may change the present exploitation of nature and humankind. Growing solidarity with people affected by disasters is empowering women and girls and dismantling from the bottom-up, the dominant structures of violence and exploitation. Originality/value: The military-industrial-scientific corporate complex and the exploitation of women, men and natural resources, based on patriarchy, has produced climate change, poverty and global pandemics with millions of unnecessary deaths and suffering. A doughnut engendered peace looking from the outside and inside of the system of globalization and environmental destruction proposes to overcome the growth addiction by a growth agnostic society. Engendered peace explores alternative and sustainable values that go beyond the dominant technological changes. It includes a culturally, politically and institutionally ingrained model where everybody is a participant, reinforcing an engendered-sustainable peace and security for everybody. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anthropocene; Decolonizing peace; Engendered-sustainable peace; Global South; HUGE peace and security; Systemic alternatives",,Article,"Article in Press",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126366088

The systems, product of local traditional knowledge, are mainly devoted to coffee production but, thanks to the interaction with other species, farmers provide different food products both for self-consumption and to be sold. Furthermore, the adoption of shade trees in order to reach a better quality of the coffee cultivated creates particular microclimate conditions favorable for microorganisms, fauna species and also for spontaneous flora species. According to this it is clear the relationships between traditional knowledge and biodiversity preservation which is fundamental also for improving the surrounding environment, avoiding floods or hydrogeological instability damages, concurring to climate change mitigation and carbon storage. Traditional agroforestry systems are one of the best example of coexistence and coevolution between man and nature, being an historical system adopted by local communities to satisfy their needs in total respect of the surrounding environment. Considering this, the promotion and maintenance of this kind of systems and knowledge related might constitute a valid example to actively preserve biodiversity while respecting human needs for food and livelihood security. These systems are also of particular importance considering the importance of coffee as a beverage served in many countries of the world, but often produced in intensive plantations. This paper shows the high sustainability of coffee production under the shade of trees and support a new concept of food quality contributing to preserve local cultures and environments. © 2022, The Author(s).","Agricultural heritage; Agrobiodiversity; Agroforestry; Coffee; Traditional knowledge",,Article,"Article in Press",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124738654

Understanding the contribution of different agricultural practices to supply ESs would help inform choices about the most beneficial land use management. Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are defined by IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) as actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges (e.g., climate change, food and water security, or natural disasters) effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human wellbeing and biodiversity benefits. Some actions farmers can implement in the new Rural Development Programs (RDP 2021–2022 and 2023–2027) can be considered as NbS and could affect the quantity, quality, and time of some ESs related to water regulation and supply, N adsorption and erosion protection. This study aims to evaluate these ESs in different scenarios in the upper Foglia river basin (Italy) and at a local scale (farming), and to highlight the issue to compensate farmers for the production of public goods which benefit the whole society (ESs) by the implementation of RDP’s actions. These scenarios highlight how actions have positive effects on ecosystem services and their economic value related to land use management, on maintaining agricultural practices by integrating Water Frame Directive (2000/60/EC), Directive 2007/60/EC on the management of flood risks and highlighting the potential role of farmers in a high diversity landscape. This study highlights a new way to evaluate the processes of natural capital in the production of public goods, which benefits the whole society (ESs), by emphasizing the economic and environmental role of farmers in producing them and putting on the table data to trigger a PES (Payment for Ecosystem Services) mechanism. To facilitate decision making, robust decision support tools are needed, underpinned by comprehensive cost-benefit analyses and spatially modeling in which agriculture can be a strategic sector to optimize food production and environmental protection in harmony with the Farm to Fork (F2F) strategy. © 2021 by the authors.

The human population in drylands, currently estimated at 2.7 billion, faces limited access to sufficient, affordable, and nutritious food. We discuss the interlinkages among water security, environmental security, energy security, economic security, health security, and food security governance, and how they affect food security in drylands. Reliable and adequate water supply, and the prevention of water contamination, increase the potential for ample food, fodder, and fiber production. Protecting woodlands and rangelands increases food security by buffering the slow onset effects of climate change, including biodiversity loss, desertification, salinization, and land degradation. The protection of natural lands is expected to decrease environmental contamination, and simultaneously, reduce the transfer of diseases from wildlife to humans. Biofuel production and hydroelectric power plants increase energy security but generate land-use conflicts, deforestation, and ecosystem degradation. Economic security generally positively correlates with food security. However, economic growth often degrades the environment, changes tenure rights over natural resources, and stimulates migration to urban areas, resulting in lower food and health security. Moreover, civil unrest, political instability, and armed conflicts disrupt local economies in drylands. Maintaining food security is crucial for health security; conversely, malnourished populations and unresponsive health systems decrease economic security, and adversely affect environmental, energy, and food security. Climate change is expected to deteriorate health security by spreading vector-borne diseases. Effective governance and timely interventions can substantially shorten periods of food insecurity, lower their intensities, and accelerate recovery from inevitable crises, and are therefore crucial in preventing humanitarian crises. Since global drylands population will nearly double by 2050, and since drylands are among the most susceptible areas to climate change, integrated multi-hazard approaches to food security are needed. © 2021 by the authors.

In this review, we examine the impact of CMF use on planetary health, considering in particular its effects on climate change, water use and pollution and the consequences of these effects for human health. Milk is the main ingredient in the production of CMF, making the role of the dairy sector a key area of attention. We find that CMF use has twice the carbon footprint of breastfeeding, while 1 kg of CMF has a blue water footprint of 699 L; CMF has a significant and harmful environmental impact.

A study protocol is presented aiming to determine the occurrence and levels of PPP residues in plants (crops), animals (livestock), humans and other non-target species (ecosystem representatives) for exposure modelling and impact assessment. To achieve this, we designed a cross-sectional study to compare conventional and organic farm systems across Europe. Environmental and biological samples were/are being/will be collected during the 2021 growing season, at 10 case study sites in Europe covering a range of climate zones and crops. An additional study site in Argentina will inform the impact of PPP use on growing soybean which is an important European protein-source in animal feed. We will study the impact of PPP mixtures using an integrated risk assessment methodology. The fate of PPP in environmental media (soil, water and air) and in the homes of farmers will be monitored. This will be complemented by biomonitoring to estimate PPP uptake by humans and farm animals (cow, goat, sheep and chicken), and by collection of samples from non-target species (earthworms, fish, aquatic and terrestrial macroinvertebrates, bats, and farm cats). We will use data on PPP residues in environmental and biological matrices to estimate exposures by modelling. These exposure estimates together with health and toxicity data will be used to predict the impact of PPP use on environment, plant, animal and human health. The outcome of this study will then be integrated with socio-economic information leading to an overall assessment used to identify transition pathways towards more sustainable plant protection and inform decision makers, practitioners and other stakeholders regarding farming practices and land use policy. © 2021 Silva et al.

Moreover, changing climate resulted in a substantial loss in agricultural productivity (both in quantity and in quality) mainly due to diverse abiotic and biotic stresses. This draws public awareness about depleting natural resources, viz., soil, land, and water due to unsustainable agricultural practices and equivalently concerns for food-related animal and human health risks. Modern organic agriculture has shown positive impacts in terms of food/biomass production, climate resilience, soil health, biodiversity, nutritional security, and good quality of life; and is of prodigious demand for nutrient-rich organic food products. In the ensuing decade, owing to the principal focus for the quality aspects or health benefits of organic agriculture, this review explores how organic interventions affect the nutritional value and yield quality in a production system; enable plants to adapt to adverse futuristic environmental conditions, and address the global food and nutritional security challenges. The chronological emergence, current global status, public perceptions, and key components of organic agriculture with their attached health benefits are inextricably synthesized herein. Fostering the ethos of organic agriculture under the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030) is highly imperative for agroecosystem restoration and its sustainable management. Moreover, the multidimensional paybacks of organic agriculture help in attaining important global goals and targets such as the Bonn Challenge and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) by the year 2030.

Amid competitive water needs for agricultural, domestic, and industrial sectors, water allocations for environmental requirements are critical to ensure the sustainability of the ecosystems. This study takes stock of water availability trends per capita across countries and proposes a water scarcity indicator to quantify the amount of water available for agricultural, domestic, and industrial activities after the needs of freshwater ecosystems (environmental flow requirements, EFR) are ideally fulfilled. The study reveals that by 2050, 87 out of 180 countries will have annual renewable water resources (ARWR) per capita below 1700 m3/year. The number of countries with absolute water scarcity – ARWR per capita below 500 m3/year is projected to increase from 25 in 2015 to 45 by 2050. Population growth is projected to cause a sharp decline in water availability in many low-income and lower-middle-income countries, while economic development will push water use upwards, making the water supply gap more complicated and challenging to address. After the Middle East and North Africa region, Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to become the next hotspot of water scarcity along with several countries from Asia. In response, water-scarce countries need to promote water conservation, water recycling, and reuse; ensure sustainable water resources augmentation via harnessing the potential of unconventional water resources; support productivity enhancement of underperforming land and water resources; and address challenges beyond technical solutions.

Research on China's climate change in the context of global climate change is of great significance for global and Chinese food security as well as the sustained and stable development of the social economy. Compared with surface temperature data obtained via thermal infrared remote sensing, information regarding the maximum surface temperature is of increased significance as it removes the influence of clouds and rain. The annual variation of the maximum surface temperature is relatively stable; however, it is highly sensitive to changes in land use, drought, and heat waves. This study uses moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface temperature data and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to obtain the annual maximum surface temperature using the maximum value synthesis method. On the basis of the MODIS LST data from 2003 to 2018, the temporal and spatial distribution and variation characteristics of annual LST maxima in China were analyzed using techniques including the climate trend rate and linear correlation coefficient, and regional analyses were conducted according to the agricultural climate regionalization of China. The correlation between the annual maximum change of the LST and land cover types in China is established. The correlation between the annual maximum LST and the maximum NDVI in the regions with significant trend changes is studied, and the factors that influence the annual maximum LST change in China are investigated. The results obtained indicate the following: (1) The annual maximum value of China's surface temperature presents a higher spatial distribution characteristic in the north and lower in the south; its highest value was observed in the Turpan Basin of Xinjiang. (2) According to the analysis of the spatial distribution of the annual maximum surface temperature in China's climate zoning, the annual maximum surface temperature is the highest in the temperate continental climate zone, with an average of 325.39 K over 16 years. The second hottest region is the temperate monsoon climate zone, where the average annual maximum surface temperature over 16 years is 312.84 K. The plateau mountain, subtropical monsoon, and tropical monsoon climate zones have lower values of annual maximum surface temperature. The spatial distribution pattern of the annual maximum surface temperature is related to the type of surface cover. (3) During the period of 2003-2018, the temporal variation of the annual maximum surface temperature in China showed a slight cooling trend, with a climate tendency rate of -0.06 K·(10a)- 1; the area in which a cooling trend was observed accounted for 50.45% of the country's total area. (4) The climate tendency rate of the annual maximum surface temperature and the linear correlation coefficient are high in the west and low in the east, and the warming trend in the west is clearer than that in the east. Some areas showed a significant cooling trend; these areas included central northern China, southern China, and the edge of the Tarim Basin. The cooling in these areas is related to changes in the vegetation cover. The maximum surface temperature contains a large amount of geographic information, which reflects the impact of human activities on the geographic environment and provides theoretical support for decisions related to transforming the geographic environment. © 2021 Arid Land Geography.

The analysis of spatial variability allowed for the determination of four different subregions based on the differences in the average values of precipitation and the degree of rainfall variability. The trend analysis indicates that the current rainfall patterns contradict previous estimates of a progressive decrease in annual averages due to climate change in the study region, as most of the department does not exhibit statistically significant trends, except for the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta area, where this study found reductions between 10 mm yr−1 and 30 mm yr−1.

Conversely, livestock is associated with negative impacts on human health, animal welfare, and ecosystems. Thereby, a broad knowledge of the impacts of pasture-based beef production is essential for proposing sustainable practices and systems, particularly in Brazil, due to its importance. In this context, this study aims to assess the environmental impacts of beef production systems characteristic of different Brazilian biomes and, thus, provide baselines that support the future development of differentiated mitigation alternatives. Four systems were defined based on the relevance of the livestock activity in the Amazon, Cerrado, Pampa, and Pantanal biomes. Its main environmental impacts and components were identified using the life cycle analysis - LCA method, during the entire productive lives of the animals. GHG emissions resulted in mean values for Brazilian beef production of 13.32 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of live weight gain. The Cerrado presented higher values of terrestrial acidification, depletion of metals and fossil fuels, freshwater and marine ecotoxicity, and particulate matter formation. The Pantanal was more impacting in terms of climate change, water depletion, freshwater and marine eutrophication, and the photochemical oxidants formation. The Pampa was the region with the highest agricultural land occupation. Human toxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity were negative in all systems. Occupation of urban areas, ozone depletion, natural areas transformation, and ionizing radiation were not significant, concerning other human activities after normalization. The inclusion of different impact categories in the analysis offers new perspectives to minimize the impacts of Brazilian livestock on the planet. Pasture-based animal production systems with greater ecological, water, and carbon footprints show better results in indicators related to human health and environmental conservation. The intensification of grazing and the introduction of more productive forage species may represent new opportunities for adding value, improving life quality, and conservation of sensitive areas found in different environments that make up the diversity of Brazilian livestock production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agro-ecological zoning; Agroecosystems; Global warming; Grassland management; Meat supply chain; Sustainable intensification","Agriculture; Animals; Carbon footprint; Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Food supply; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Meats; Ozone layer; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Water; Agro-ecological zoning; Agro-ecosystems; Beef production; Cattle production; Cerrado; Grassland management; Human health; Meat supply chain; Pantanal; Sustainable intensification; Global warming",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107750583

This was not the case some few decades ago where indigenous technologies were used in exploiting natural resources. Unfortunately, the effects of climate change on the planet are no more distant reality. The melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, extreme rainfall, and prolonged drought are already being experienced. These have affected water resources, land, and food security across the world. The limits of conventional climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies call for the integration of indigenous knowledge and technologies for tackling climate change issues. This is because of the importance that indigenous knowledge and technologies have for identifying the impacts and as well providing effective adaption and mitigation strategies to climate change. Thus, this chapter explores the potential of indigenous knowledge and technologies for the sustainable management of water, land, and food security amidst climate change. The applications of indigenous technologies and knowledge such as agroforestry, the use of sacred groves to conserve water, land, and biodiversity resources, and the practising of conservation-agriculture are discussed as solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, water shortages, land degradation, and pollution. However, these indigenous technologies will be less useful in today's world if not harnessed. Thus also in this chapter, the scientific know-how available to improve the effectiveness of indigenous technologies for the sustainable use of water, land, and food resources have been identified (Robotics, sensors/detectors, internet of things) and discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Imoro, Imoro, Duwiejuah and Abukari.","adaptation; climate-change; indigenous; mitigation; sustainable-agriculture",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113720301

Food systems account for 21–34% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Over the past half-century, water and land-use changes have significantly impacted ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles, biodiversity, and climate. At the same time, food production is falling behind consumption, and global grain reserves are shrinking. Some predictions suggest that crop yields must approximately double by 2050 to adequately feed an increasing global population without a large expansion of crop area. To achieve this, “quantum-leap” improvements in crop cultivar productivity are needed within very narrow planetary boundaries of permissible environmental perturbations. Strategies for such a “quantum-leap” include mutation breeding and genetic engineering of known crop genome sequences. Synthetic biology makes it possible to synthesize DNA fragments of any desired sequence, and modern bioinformatics tools may hopefully provide an efficient way to identify targets for directed modification of selected genes responsible for known important agronomic traits. CRISPR/Cas9 is a new technology for incorporating seamless directed modifications into genomes; it is being widely investigated for its potential to enhance the efficiency of crop production. We consider the optimism associated with the new genetic technologies in terms of the complexity of most agronomic traits, especially crop yield potential (Yp) limits. We also discuss the possible directions of overcoming these limits and alternative ways of providing humanity with food without transgressing planetary boundaries. In conclusion, we support the long-debated idea that new technologies are unlikely to provide a rapidly growing population with significantly increased crop yield. Instead, we suggest that delicately balanced humane measures to limit its growth and the amount of food consumed per capita are highly desirable for the foreseeable future. © 2021 by the authors.

This review article aims to highlight the relevance and knowledge gaps regarding GBI from the perspective of the food–energy–water (FEW) nexus, these being key resources for the survival of human communities. In particular, this review was focused on publications on urban ecosystem services (positive effects) and dis-services (negative effects) associated with different GBI typologies. The review proved that GBI can contribute environmentally, socially, and economically to FEW security and urban sustainability. Yet, such positive effects must be considered against ecosystem dis-services tradeoffs, including urban food production, commonly connected with heavy water and energy consumption, specifically under dry climate conditions, and sometimes related to an excessive use of manure, pesticides, or fertilizers. These conditions could pose either a risk to water quality and local insect survival or serve enhanced mosquito breeding because of irrigation. Up to now, the review evidenced that few nexus modeling techniques have been discussed in terms of their benefits, drawbacks, and applications. Guidance is provided on the choice of an adequate modeling approach. Water, energy, and food are intrinsically associated physically. However, depending on their management, their tradeoffs are often increased. There is a need to minimize these tradeoffs and to build up synergies between food, energy, and water using a holistic approach. This is why the FEW nexus approach offers good insights to address the relation between three important individual resource components of sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

This benthic productivity is supporting secondary production and supplying important services to humans including food provisioning. Increased frequencies of extreme events in weather (such as heatwaves, storm surges and cloudbursts) are expected to strongly impact the spatiotemporal dynamics of the microphytobenthos and subsequently their contribution to coastal food webs. Within north-western Europe, the years 2018 and 2019 were characterized by record-breaking summer temperatures and accompanying droughts. Field-calibrated satellite data (Sentinel 2) were used to quantify the seasonal dynamics of microphytobenthos biomass and production at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution during these years. We demonstrate that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) should be used with caution in depositional coastal intertidal systems, because it may reflect import of remains of allochthonous pelagic productivity rather than local benthic biomass. We show that the reduction in summer biomass of the benthic microalgae cannot be explained by grazing but was most probably due to the high temperatures. The fivefold increase in salinity from January to September 2018, resulting from reduced river run-off during this exceptionally dry year, cannot have been without consequences for the vitality of the microphytobenthos community and its resistance to wind stress and cloud bursts. Comparison to historical information revealed that primary productivity of microphytobenthos may vary at least fivefold due to variations in environmental conditions. Therefore, ongoing changes in environmental conditions and especially extreme events because of climate change will not only lead to changes in spatiotemporal patterns of benthic primary production but also to changes in biodiversity of life under water and ecosystem services including food supply.

While emissions of green-house gasses (GHG) from cattle have significant global warming potential, these are biogenic sources and substantially involve carbon in natural cycles, rather than fossil fuel. Cattle use human inedible feeds and by-products of human food production to produce nutrient-dense foods of great value to humans. Interventions to reduce GHG production: Reductions in land clearing and burning of grasslands and increased carbon sequestration in soils and trees have potential to substantially reduce GHG emissions. Increased efficiencies of production through intensified feeding and enteric modification have markedly reduced intensity of GHG emissions for cattle in Australia. Genetic selection for lower emissions has modest, but cumulative potential to reduce GHG (mostly CH4) emissions and intensity. Improved reproductive performance can reduce intensity of GHG emissions, especially in beef production. Feeds and technologies that reduce GHG production and intensity include improved pastures, grain feeding, dietary lipids, nitrates, ionophores, seaweed, 3-NOP, hormonal growth promotants in beef, and improved diets for peri-parturient dairy cattle. There is considerable potential to further reduce emissions from cattle using the technologies reviewed. Interventions to reduce heat stress: Cattle are susceptible to heat stress and ameliorating interventions include tree and shelter belts, shade, housing, cooling with fans and water and dietary manipulations. Conclusions: Numerous interventions can reduce GHG emissions and intensity from cattle. There are opportunities to increase carbon capture and maintain biodiversity in Australia's extensive rangelands, but these require quantification and application. We can reduce the intensity of CH4 emissions for cattle in Australia and simultaneously improve their well-being. © 2021 Australian Veterinary Association.","beef; cattle; dairy; emissions; green-house gasses; intensity","abrucomstat; arachidonic acid; beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; docosahexaenoic acid; growth promotor; icosapentaenoic acid; ionophore; linoleic acid; linolenic acid; lipid; mineral; nitrate; protein; recombinant growth hormone; tannin; methane; agronomy; animal food; animal husbandry; Article; Australia; beef cattle; carbon footprint; cattle farming; cattle manure; climate change; dairy cattle; dairy industry; dietary supplement; dry matter intake; environmental impact; food industry; food quality; food security; genetic selection; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; livestock; meat industry; milk production; nonhuman; organoleptic property; production efficiency; radiative forcing; reproductive success; seaweed; water supply; animal; bovine; climate; diet; Animals; Australia; Cattle; Climate; Diet; Food Security; Methane",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105609799

Human-induced environmental change in Indonesian lakes has considerably increased since the new order in 1970. In general, many Indonesian lakes had deteriorated due to sedimentation and eutrophication, which induced the blooming of aquatic plants, mostly by water hyacinth. Water security becomes a problem, particularly in the dry seasons, but water overflow and flooding occur in many places during wet seasons. Landscape and climate changes, pollution, species diversity, preserved in lake sediment, provide long-term proof of environmental changes. This paper will discuss a paleolimnological approach to reconstruct past environmental changes. Paleolimnology is learning about stratigraphy sediment of the lakes where fossils are well preserved in the sediment and provide information about the past conditions of the catchment area. Lakes' sediment records the changes in condition of the catchment area, like a diary book. Paleolimnology had been studied for Rawapening Lake and Telaga Warna Lake, Dieng.

Large uncertainties still plague quantitative assessments of climate change impacts and water resource management, but what is known for certain is that the climate is changing and that it will have an effect on water resources. Therefore, increased efforts will be needed to plan and manage water supplies in the future through increased monitoring and understanding of the interrelationships between population size, climate change, and water availability. The focus of water management is gradually shifting from developing new water sources to using existing water sources more effectively and efficiently. The world needs policy change in water management. Respect for water resources and their value is the starting point of deliberations. Governments have the essential water management function: to protect and allocate water resources to allow both individual and collective interests to benefit from water. Societies must also lead in understanding, provisioning for mitigating the impact of disasters, ranging from extreme droughts to unprecedented floods, caused by climate change and poor management of water and land. Public funds will likely remain the main source of water sectoral funding. It is up to governments to invest wisely to enhance the crucial role that water has for social and economic development in a country. Integrated water resource management strategy is accepted as a global model for achieving the objective of a sustainable water management system. © 2021 by IGI Global.

Here we summarize the known negative effects of IA on pollinator biodiversity and illustrate these problems by considering the case of Chile, a “world biodiversity hotspot” (WBH) where food exports account for a considerable share of the economy in this country. Most of Chile’s WBH area is currently being replaced by IA at a fast pace, threatening local biodiversity. We present an agroecological strategy for sustainable food production and pollinator conservation in food‐producing WBHs. In this we recognize native pollinators as internal inputs that cannot be replaced by IA technological packages and support the development of agroecological and biodiversity restorative practices to protect biodiversity. We suggest four fundamental pillars for food production change based on: (1) sharing the land, restoring and protecting; (2) ecological intensification; (3) localized knowledge, research, and technological devel-opment; and (4) territorial planning and implementation of socio‐agroecological policies. This approach does not need modification of native pollination services that sustain the world with food and basic subsistence goods, but a paradigm changes where the interdependency of nature and human wellbeing must be recognized for ensuring the world’s food security and sovereignty. © 2021 by the authors.

Inadequate intake can negatively affect development and result in a wide range of adverse health outcomes. Rice, maize, and wheat provide over 60% of the world's food energy intake. Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), water, nitrogen, and soil micronutrients are the basis of this plant material. Since 1850-1900, CO2 concentrations have increased about 50%, with most of that increase since 1950. Higher CO2 concentrations increase photosynthesis, which then increases plant biomass, but also alters the nutritional quality of wheat, rice, and other C3 plants. We review the possible impacts of rising CO2 concentrations on human health, highlight uncertainties, and propose a research agenda to maintain the nutritional quality of C3 plants. We also synthesize options for addressing this critical challenge to nutritional safety and security. A complete research agenda requires addressing data and knowledge gaps surrounding plant biology and policy responses. Data on key nutrients are lacking, leading to a limited mechanistic understanding of the response of the plant ionome to elevated CO2 concentrations. Regular data are largely missing on nutritional status and food safety in low- and middle-income countries, limiting assessments of the magnitude of the risks. Research opportunities to fill gaps in data and understanding include herbaria studies, field-based natural and manipulative studies, leveraging natural plant variability, and innovations in seed quality. Improved models of cereal crop nutritional quality can project the magnitude and direction of possible future challenges; incorporating the effects of climate change into those models can further improve their robustness. Transdisciplinary research involving at least ecologists, plant physiologists, economists, and experts in human nutrition is essential for developing a systems-based understanding of the potential impacts of rising CO2 concentrations for human nutrition and the attendant consequences for achieving the sustainable development goal on food security. © 2021 The Author(s).

The necessity to realize SDGs by 2030 also inspires a greater sense of responsibility and care for soils. Sustainable management of soil health is important to achieving several SDGs. Pertinent SDGs intricately connected with soil health include SDG 1 (End Poverty), 2 (Zero Hunger), 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), 5 (Gender Equality), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 9 (Industry Innovation and Infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), 13 (Climate Action), and 15 (Life on Land). Some of these SDGs rely considerably on plant production and others depend on soil processes. Pertinent among soil processes are water movement, heat transfer, sorption and physical filtration, ion exchange, and biochemical and biophysical transformations. In terms of specific accomplishments, 130 countries have aligned with the Zero Hunger Challenge, the globally available fresh water has decreased to 71% of needs, Technosols (soils whose formation is influenced by anthropogenic based materials) are used in urban ecosystems, food wastes are composted, specific targets of Land Degradation Neutrality have been signed by several countries, and soil C sequestration targets are widely implemented through initiatives such as the 4 Per Thousand (4P1000) initiative, Platform on Climate Action in Americas (PLACA), Adapting African Agriculture (AAA), Living Soils of the Americas (LiSAM), etc. In addition, policy and regulatory frameworks being widely promoted by several U.N. agencies (e.g., U.N. SDGs,limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2 °C) can be supported by innovations in soil science including forensic soil science, remote sensing and other innovations. Soil health is becoming a central element of the research and innovation program of the EU, aiming to reach a 75% of healthy soils by 2030. In addition, the importance of soil health to human health and environmental issues is being widely promoted through educational books on soil science and secondary schools, as well as the revision of curricula. With continuous progress in movement into the digital world, transfer and communication of knowledge of the soil sciences can improve for the end users, policymakers, and the general public but additional efforts are needed.

Extensive areas of the Americas are at significant risk of water insecurity, resulting from global-change processes coupled with regional and local impacts. Drought, flooding, and water quality challenges pose significant threats, while at the same time, rapid urban expansion, competing water demands, river modifications, and expanding global markets for water-intensive agricultural products drive water insecurity. This paper takes a social-ecological systems perspective, aiming to identify examples and pathways towards resilient ecosystems and social development. It draws on lessons from two science-policy network projects, one focusing on water scarcity in arid and semi-arid regions of Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Peru, Mexico and the United States; and the second addressing river and lake basins as sentinels of climate variability and human effects on water quantity and quality in Canada, the United States, Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay and Chile. Together, these ‘complementary contrasts’ provide an analytical basis to empirically examine stakeholder engagement, knowledge co-production and science-policy interaction supporting decision-making to achieve water security. The paper identifies four tenets for decision-making based on water-security-focused global-change science in the Americas: 1) Decision makers should focus on protecting ecosystems because water security (along with food and energy security) depend on them; 2) Water-use and allocation decisions ought to be made considering future environmental and societal vulnerabilities, especially climate projections; 3) Holistic approaches (at basin or other appropriate levels) are best suited to ensure social-ecological system resilience and reduce vulnerability; and 4) It is essential to support local/traditional livelihoods, and underserved populations to achieve equitable water security and ecosystem resilience. © 2020","Decision-making; Ecosystem resilience; River basins; Social vulnerability; Water security",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099507175

In contrast, RQ use in understanding physiology and nutrition of aquatic ectotherms has been restricted due to technical challenges in measuring total CO2 in water. With technical advances in measuring total CO2 in water, RQ in aquatic ectotherms can be accurately determined and is potentially available as a valuable method. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of studies on RQ and metabolic energy substrate use in aquatic ectotherms. Metabolic energy substrate use is evaluated by a reliable stoichiometric bioenergetic approach, based on measuring RQ and nitrogen quotient (NQ) simultaneously. Stoichiometry provides a non-destructive and unequivocal way to quantify the instantaneous oxidation of each major energy substrate (protein, lipid or carbohydrate). This review aims to refine knowledge about bioenergetics of aquatic ectotherms under different conditions including nutritional aspects of sustainable aquaculture. Notably, stoichiometry provides a promising approach to optimize feeds and feeding regimes to realize sustainable aquaculture under differing conditions and with differing feed ingredients. It also provides an approach to consider climate change impacts and physiological adaptation mechanisms for survival and development in farmed environments and natural ecosystems. Stoichiometric bioenergetics knowledge in aquatic ectotherms has relevance to commercial impacts in the face of overfishing and food security, and ecological significance in the face of environmental change scenarios.

Although a common framework is used, each ecosystem has its own characteristics. The agroecosystem, for example, is an anthropised ecosystem where ecosystem service flows are highly interrelated with the environment, positively or negatively. Therefore, agroecosystem services are usually accompanied by disservices. The valuation of agroecosystem services and disservices requires adaptation of existing ecosystem services paradigms to accommodate the innate agroecosystem idiosyncrasies. To this end, in this study, a comprehensive approach for valuation of agroecosystem services and disservices was proposed and validated in a semi-arid western Mediterranean agricultural area through stakeholder assessment, using a choice experiment. The results suggest that all categories of services (provisioning, regulating, and cultural) should be taken into account when valuing agroecosystem services and disservices. In particular, food provision (a provisioning service), water (a provisioning disservice), local climate regulation and biodiversity (regulating services), waste treatment and water purification (regulating disservices), and recreation and tourism (cultural services) are relevant for this purpose. Their relative importance in agroecosystems valuation reached 70% for agroecosystem services and 30% for disservices. Specifically, biodiversity (38%) emerged as the most relevant agroecosystem service to be valued, followed by recreation and tourism (20%), local climate regulation (7%), and food provision (5%). Among the agroecosystem disservices, water and waste treatment (15%), and water purification (15%) together contributed to 30% of the total importance. Agroecosystems should be valued considering their multifunctional character and the integration of agroecosystem services and disservices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropised ecosystems; Choice experiment; Human well-being; Mediterranean agroecosystems; Stakeholder assessment","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Purification; Tourism; Waste treatment; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Agricultural areas; Agro ecosystems; Choice experiments; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem services; Valuation of ecosystem services; Water purification; Western Mediterranean; Ecosystems; agricultural ecosystem; anthropogenic effect; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; experiment; quality of life; stakeholder; valuation; agroecosystem; agroecosystem disservice; agroecosystem service; air quality; Article; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; controlled study; environmental sustainability; fertilizer application; food security; human; priority journal; questionnaire; rural area; social status; thermodynamics; validation study; waste management; water management; water pollution; wellbeing; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099152706

We carried out 35 semi-structured, qualitative in-depth interviews with SDPs, representing national governmental institutions, international organizations, and civil society organizations. The interviews were analyzed using content analysis. SDPs shared similar perceptions of CC and concurred with three ideas (1) CC is a real and lived experience in BF; (2) the population is aware of climatic changes in their environment; (3) CC is intertwined with the agricultural and economic development of the country. SDPs identified biodiversity loss, floods, droughts, and extreme heat as posing the highest risk to health. They elaborated five exposure pathways that are and will be affected by CC: water quality and quantity, heat stress, food supply and safety, vector borne diseases, and air quality. In conclusion, SDPs in Burkina Faso are highly aware of CC hazards, relevant health exposure pathways, and their corresponding health outcomes. Mental health and the interplay between social factors and complex health risks constitute perception gaps.

Despite considerable inter-individual variation across bacterial species, the dominant phyla are generally highly conserved. There are several exogenous and gut environmental factors that play a role in modulating the composition and activities of colonic bacteria including diet with intakes of different macronutrients, including protein, accounting for approximately 20% of the microbial variation. Certain bacterial species tend to be considered as generalists and can metabolise a broad range of substrates, including both carbohydrate- and protein-derived substrates, whilst other species are specialists with a rather limited metabolic capacity. Metabolism of peptides and amino acids by gut bacteria can result in the formation of a wide range of metabolites several of which are considered deleterious to health including nitrosamines, heterocyclic amines and hydrogen sulphide as some of these products are genotoxic and have been linked to colonic disease. Beneficial metabolites however include SCFA and certain species can use amino acids to form butyrate which is the major energy source for colonocytes. The impact on health may however depend on the source of these products. In this review, we consider the impact of diet, particularly protein diets, on modulating the composition of the gut microbiota and likely health consequences and the potential impact of climate change and food security.

As long-standing interactions between people and nature are modified by global environmental change, dynamic and diversified livelihood strategies that enable seasonal adaptation will be critical for vulnerable coastal communities. However, the success of such strategies depends on a range of poorly understood influences. Gleaning, the hand-based collection of marine organisms from littoral habitats, provides an interesting case study of dynamic change in social-ecological interactions. It is an important coastal livelihood strategy, yet seasonal gleaning dynamics have not been empirically explored in contemporary communities. We examined seasonal gleaning in eight coastal communities on Atauro Island, Timor-Leste, using household surveys and satellite-derived maps of shallow-water benthic habitats. Our analysis explored the factors affecting household decisions to glean in each season, the relationship between gleaning and seafood consumption, and seasonal gleaning pressure on near-shore coastal resources. Dynamic marine harvesting strategies differed among households and gleaning activity was seasonally heterogeneous. Not all gleaning households gleaned during the season characterised by rough sea conditions despite rough season gleaning being associated with greater seafood consumption stability among seasons. Households also gleaned less regularly, and catches were smaller, in the rough season. Differences in seasonal participation in gleaning were explained mostly by type and extent of shallow habitat proximate to a community. In the calm season, household gleaning was positively related to the total area of shallow habitat, and in the rough season the percentage of hard-bottom shallow habitat was also an important predictor of gleaning activity. Our findings illustrate how changes in the biophysical environment mediate human–nature interactions at fine scales through time and space. Consequently, this research highlights the importance of context-specific perspectives for understanding drivers and dynamics in fishing pressure on littoral ecosystems, access to ecosystem benefits and limits to adaptation. Factors influencing when livelihood activities are feasible and desirable are important for evaluating the social impacts of climate change, particularly in the context of rural communities in the Global South.

In this study, we employed life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) modeling to evaluate the environmental impacts and economic competitiveness of biodiesel production from WCO in China. The endpoint impacts, including the damage to human health, ecosystem quality, and resource availability, and relevant midpoint impacts were examined. The results show that compared to conventional fossil diesel, the overall endpoint environmental impacts of WCO-based biodiesel are lower, particularly in terms of resource depletion. However, for the midpoint impacts, WCO-based biodiesel has higher impacts on climate change, particulate matter generation, photochemical oxidant formation, human toxicity, and water depletion. The majority of the environmental impacts are due to transesterification, except for water depletion, which is mainly derived from the transportation of the biodiesel fuel. The LCC of the biodiesel is estimated to be 6460 RMB per ton, which is about 31% higher than that of fossil diesel (4921 RMB per ton). The LCC of WCO-based biodiesel is mainly determined by the WCO collection, with a share of 83%. The high purchasing price of WCO feedstock and the fluctuations in international oil prices lead to difficulties in biodiesel industry development. Additionally, the multiple consumers of WCO, the low energy conversion rate, and the immature utilization of the by-products also hinder the massive deployment of WCO-based biodiesel in China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; LCA; LCC; Waste cooking oil","Biodiesel; Climate change; Cooking; Costs; Crude oil price; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Energy conversion; Energy security; Life cycle; Oils and fats; Sustainable development; Economic competitiveness; Economic feasibilities; Energy conversion rates; Environmental pollutions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle costs (LCC); Photochemical oxidants; Resource availability; Environmental impact",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099653763

Here, we examine the various types of factors influencing fasciolosis transmission and burden and the interrelations that may exist between them. We present the arsenal of molecules, 'adjusting' capabilities and parasitic strategies of Fasciola to infect. Such features define the high adaptability of Fasciola species for parasitism that facilitate their transmission. We discuss current environmental perturbations (increase of livestock and land use, climate change, introduction of alien species and biodiversity loss) in relation to fasciolosis dynamics. As Fasciola infection is directly and ultimately linked to livestock management, living conditions and cultural habits, which are also changing under the pressure of globalization and climate change, the social component of transmission is also discussed. Lastly, we examine the implication of increasing scientific and political awareness in highlighting the current circulation of fasciolosis and boosting epidemiological surveys and novel diagnostic techniques. From a joint perspective, it becomes clear that factors weight differently at each place and moment, depending on the biological, environmental, social and political interrelating contexts. Therefore, the analyses of a disease as complex as fasciolosis should be as integrative as possible to dissect the realities featuring each epidemiological scenario.

Ecological restoration, when it was implemented effectively, contributes to improving food and water security, mitigating climate change, protecting biodiversity, boosting economic prosperity and benefiting human health and well-being. Thus, ecological restoration is fundamental for the success of ecological civilization and sustainable development. Ecological restoration theories in developed countries usually require restoring the ecosystem to the status prior to degradation, and this requirement is difficult to achieve in regions with serious degradation, especially in developing countries. We developed a new theory of ecological restoration, or stepwise ecological restoration (STERE), which comprises three modes in different restoration stages: Environmental remediation in the initial stage with serious degradation, ecological rehabilitation for moderately degraded ecosystems, and natural restoration for slightly degraded ecosystems. Environmental remediation aims to reduce environmental pollution through the removal or detoxification of pollutants or excess nutrients from soil and water. Ecological rehabilitation is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed through various physical, chemical and biological restoration strategies. Natural restoration aims to restore ecosystem functions and services and improve ecosystem resilience without much human assistance. Environmental remediation is fundamental and needs to be implemented prior to ecological rehabilitation and natural restoration in places where pollution is severe. Only the former is successfully carried out; however, when the ecosystem is moderately degraded, ecological rehabilitation can be effectively implemented. In places where the ecosystem is slightly degraded, natural restoration is recommended. The processes of ecological rehabilitation and natural restoration will result in ecological functions that are more complete, an increase in biodiversity, and improved ecosystem resilience. For STERE, appropriate restoration goals should be formulated based on the degree of degradation, local funding support, and technological development. The new theory proposed in this study emphasizes the application of reference ecosystems in restoration projects and the importance of ecological monitoring. It also requires an adaptive restoration management framework that considers the influence of global climate change. STERE should be implemented for future ecosystems rather than only for restoring an ecosystem to a status similar to the condition prior to degradation. Moreover, STERE promotes systematic large-scale landscape restoration by considering the interactions between individual small scales (e.g., field scale) and large scales (e.g., catchment scale). In addition, technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles and remote sensing should be more widely used in future STERE projects. Ecological restoration databases should be established for restorative activities in mountains, waters, forests, farms, lakes and other ecosystems. The newly proposed STERE theory would play an important role in developing restoration projects worldwide, especially in developing countries. © 2021, Science Press.

This paper reviews the developments in global aquaculture from 1997 to 2017, incorporating all industry sub-sectors and highlighting the integration of aquaculture in the global food system. Inland aquaculture—especially in Asia—has contributed the most to global production volumes and food security. Major gains have also occurred in aquaculture feed efficiency and fish nutrition, lowering the fish-in–fish-out ratio for all fed species, although the dependence on marine ingredients persists and reliance on terrestrial ingredients has increased. The culture of both molluscs and seaweed is increasingly recognized for its ecosystem services; however, the quantification, valuation, and market development of these services remain rare. The potential for molluscs and seaweed to support global nutritional security is underexploited. Management of pathogens, parasites, and pests remains a sustainability challenge industry-wide, and the effects of climate change on aquaculture remain uncertain and difficult to validate.

Resources and ecosystem services, provided by the marine environment, contribute nutrition, income, and health benefits for communities. One threat to these securities is ciguatera poisoning; worldwide, the most commonly reported non‐bacterial seafood‐related illness. Ciguatera is caused by the consumption of (primarily) finfish contaminated with ciguatoxins, potent neurotoxins produced by benthic single‐cell microalgae. When consumed, ciguatoxins are biotransformed and can bioaccumulate throughout the food‐web via complex path-ways. Ciguatera‐derived food insecurity is particularly extreme for small island‐nations, where fear of intoxication can lead to fishing restrictions by region, species, or size. Exacerbating these com-plexities are anthropogenic or natural changes occurring in global marine habitats, e.g., climate change, greenhouse‐gas induced physical oceanic changes, overfishing, invasive species, and even the international seafood trade. Here we provide an overview of the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century regarding the many facets of ciguatera, including the complex nature of this illness, the biological/environmental factors affecting the causative organisms, their toxins, vectors, detection methods, human‐health oriented responses, and ultimately an outlook towards the future. Ciguatera research efforts face many social and environmental challenges this century. However, several future‐oriented goals are within reach, including digital solutions for seafood supply chains, identifying novel compounds and methods with the potential for advanced diagnostics, treatments, and prediction capabilities. The advances described herein provide confidence that the tools are now available to answer many of the remaining questions surrounding ciguatera and therefore protection measures can become more accurate and routine. © 2021 by the authors.

The concept of pedodiversity (biotic + abiotic) is highly complex and can be broadly interpreted because it is formed from the interaction of atmospheric diversity (abiotic + biotic), biodiversity (biotic), hydrodiversity (abiotic + biotic), and lithodiversity (abiotic) within ecosphere and the anthroposphere. Pedodiversity is influenced by intrinsic (within the soil) and extrinsic (outside soil) factors, which are also relevant to ES/ED. Pedodiversity concepts and measures may need to be adapted to the ES framework and business applications. Currently, there are four main approaches to analyze pedodiversity: taxonomic (diversity of soil classes), genetic (diversity of genetic horizons), parametric (diversity of soil properties), and functional (soil behavior under different uses). The objective of this article is to illustrate the application of pedodiversity concepts and measures to value ES/ED with examples based on the contiguous United States (U.S.), its administrative units, and the systems of soil classification (e.g., U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Taxonomy, Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database). This study is based on a combination of original research and literature review examples. Taxonomic pedodiversity in the contiguous U.S. exhibits high soil diversity, with 11 soil orders, 65 suborders, 317 great groups, 2026 subgroups, and 19,602 series. The ranking of “soil order abundance” (area of each soil order within the U.S.) expressed as the proportion of the total area is: (1) Mollisols (27%), (2) Alfisols (17%), (3) Entisols (14%), (4) Inceptisols and Aridisols (11% each), (5) Spodosols (3%), (6) Vertisols (2%), and (7) Histosols and Andisols (1% each). Taxonomic, genetic, parametric, and functional pedodiversity are an essential context for analyzing, interpreting, and reporting ES/ED within the ES framework. Although each approach can be used separately, three of these approaches (genetic, parametric, and functional) fall within the “umbrella” of taxonomic pedodiversity, which separates soils based on properties important to potential use. Extrinsic factors play a major role in pedodiversity and should be accounted for in ES/ED valuation based on various databases (e.g., National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) databases). Pedodiversity is crucial in identifying soil capacity (pedocapacity) and “hotspots” of ES/ED as part of business decision making to provide more sustainable use of soil resources. Pedodiversity is not a static construct but is highly dynamic, and various human activities (e.g., agriculture, urbanization) can lead to soil degradation and even soil extinction. © 2021 by the authors.

This article discusses the opportunities and benefits of applying the concepts of regreening and rewilding of cities. The article engages with key sources and summarizes the background and development of regreening and nature‐based solutions and important policies, concerns and perspectives of international and national organizations. It introduces the integration of nature‐based solutions (NBS) as a strategy in urban planning with the aim to strengthen urban resilience and to slow down the biodiversity de-cline. Rewilding areas in cities has become a powerful strategy to bring back butterflies, insects, birds, and wildlife. In contrast to highly managed parks and gardens, these rewilding initiatives are leaving allotted spaces mostly uncultivated and self‐regulated. Contact to nature is essential for human existence, urban wellbeing, and good quality of life. Green spaces in cities—big or small—all contribute to the health and wellbeing of residents. However, many cities do not offer residents easy access to green space within the city. Improving the better distribution of and access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks is likely to deliver a large number of benefits, such as: ecosystem services, better water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, and restoring damaged ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and NBS help to keep cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microcli-mate. Rewilding has emerged as an important part of new public parks and gardens. The next step is to up‐scale citywide climate intervention strategies deployed to keep cities cool. However, as the discussion of this article shows, it is essential that the design of these NBS strategies is fully integrated with other complementary planning interventions and seeks synergies across all sectors. © 2021 by the author.

As global temperatures continue to increase, they impact on public health, migration, food security and land conflict, and as new environments become favorable, exposure to disease carrying vectors. Increased forests or natural habitat clearance for land repurposing, urbanization, road building, and water management are related to an increase in emerging vector borne parasitic diseases. The East African region remains one of the most impacted regions globally for leishmaniasis, a vector borne disease that impacts significantly on the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of affected communities and for which a lack of reporting and control interventions hinder progress toward elimination of this neglected tropical disease. As our world continues to transform, both politically and climatically, it is essential that measures are put in place to improve surveillance and disease management with implementation of control measures, including vector control, especially in low- and middle-income countries that are expected to be most impacted by changes in climate. Only through effective management, now, can we be sufficiently resilient to preventing the inevitable spread of vectors into suitable habitat and expansion of the geographical range of leishmaniasis.

This study tested the hypothesis that beekeeping can result in net-positive impacts, if pollination services and protein-containing by-products are utilised. As a case example, Finnish beekeeping practices were used. The study was performed using two different approaches. In both approaches, the evaluated impacts were related to climate change, land use, and freshwater use, and were scaled down to represent one beehive. The first approach considered honey production with pollination services and the replacement of alternative products with co-products. The impacts were normalised to correspond with planetary boundary criteria. The second approach evaluated the impacts of the different products and services of beekeeping separately. In the first approach the honey production system moved towards a safe operational space. Freshwater use was the impact category with the largest shift towards a safe operational space (39% shift). The second approach caused a global warming potential of honey production of 0.65 kgCO2-eq kg−1, when pollen and drone broods were considered as by-products and the influence of pollination services were not included. When honey, pollen, and drone broods were considered as co-products and pollination services were included, the impacts regarding land use and climate change were net-positive. The impact of freshwater use was relatively small. For honey, the impacts on the climate change, land use, and freshwater use were −0.33 kgCO2-eq kg−1, −7.89 m2 kg−1, and 14.01 kg kg−1, respectively. The impact allocation with co-products and pollination services was conclusive. A lack of consideration for the impact reduction of pollination led to beekeeping having a negative impact on the environment. Based on these results, beekeeping enhances food security within planetary boundaries, provided that pollination services and protein-containing by-/co-products are utilised. © 2020 The Authors","Beekeeping; Food system; Insect; Life cycle assessment; Netpositive; Planetary boundary","Drones; Economics; Food supply; Global warming; Proteins; Water; Environmental benefits; Global warming potential; Honey production; Impact on the environment; Impact reduction; Operational space; Products and services; Yield-increasing; Land use; apiculture; ecosystem service; environmental impact assessment; food supply; honeybee; hypothesis testing; life cycle analysis; pollination; apiculture; Article; bee pollination; climate change; environmental factor; food industry; food safety; food security; greenhouse effect; honey; honeybee; human; land use; nonhuman; priority journal; protein content; water supply; animal; bee; pollen; pollination; Finland; Hexapoda; Animals; Beekeeping; Bees; Climate Change; Honey; Pollen; Pollination",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097551812

A very persistent pattern is loss of biodiversity caused by human activities all over the world, mainly due to deforestation and agricultural expansion. One very important challenge for human societies is to find the equilibrium between economic growth and environmental sustainability. In this contribution we address the role developed by spatial heterogeneity due to resource distribution and fragmentation on the species diversity. We propose a spatial model in which species compete on a lattice that is divided in habitats containing different amount of resources. The landscape here is a fractal structure which changes gradually from highly fragmented to highly clumped. Fractal landscapes are constructed through the use of fractional Brownian motion and characterized by the Hurst exponent. We found from our simulation results that there is an optimum number of habitats in which the fragmentation level has no effect. As habitat number drift away from optimal value, fragmentation has a growing effect on biodiversity promotion, mostly for small values of the Hurst exponent H. We observed two power law regimes describing the species–area relationship, in which the exponent for small areas is always smaller than the one observed for large areas. We also observe for the majority of the cases we studied, that the value of species–area exponent in both regimes grows with the number of habitats and then drops when the number of habitats becomes large. The number of habitats revealed to be the most important variable to foster and control the biodiversity in all scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Computer simulation model; Ecosystems; Resource competition; Spatial heterogeneity; Species–area relationship","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Deforestation; Economics; Fractals; Sustainable development; Agricultural expansion; Biodiversity patterns; Environmental sustainability; Fractional brownian motion; Habitat fragmentation; Resource competitions; Resource distribution; Spatial heterogeneity; Ecosystems",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096220679

Multiple ecosystem services have widely been coupled to explore the ESP in recent years. Generally speaking, most previous studies reported that there was no trade-off relationship between ecosystem services, where different ecological processes were independent of each other. In the process of ecological node identification, it is often ignored to identify the ecological obstacle points that hinder the movement or communication between organisms, or the ecological pinch points that are more likely or very frequent in the process of biological migration. The Yellow River Basin is the main birthplace of Chinese civilization, serving as an important ecological barrier in China. It is necessary to identify the patches and corridors on regional ecological security and optimize the ecological space, thereby improving the ecosystem service function for the high-quality development of the basin. In this study, five typical ecosystem services were selected: the food supply, carbon sequestration, oxygen release, water production, and soil conservation in the Gansu section of the Yellow River Basin in 2019. A multi-scenario Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) model was used to evaluate the priority protection areas of ecosystem service in the study area in 2019 as the ecological source areas. The minimum cumulative resistance model was used to construct the basic resistance surface. The circuit theory model was selected to extract the ecological corridor and identify the ecological pinch points. The ESP was constructed for the Gansu section of the Yellow River basin with the ecological source as the core, the ecological protection priority areas with different gradients as the benchmark framework, and the ecological corridor pinch points as the axis. An optimal ecological space was achieved during the optimization. The results showed that there were 169 ecological source patches in the study area, with an area of 27 460.56 km2, accounting for 19.2% of the total study area. Five ecosystem services showed a collaborative relationship from an overall perspective. Three natural regions of Gannan Plateau, Longzhong Plateau, and Longdong Loess Plateau were significantly affected by topographic climate, vegetation cover, and human activities. There were some differences in ecosystem services in different regions. In the combination of rank weight, seven schemes were given for the ecosystem service protection, where the extracted priority reserve was the core and comprehensiveness of ecological sources, to achieve the goal of high efficiency and balanced allocation of ecosystem service protection. Considering the trade-off degree (0.935), the priority conservation areas under scenario 4 were selected as the ecological source of the study areas. The minimum cumulative resistance model was used to identify the ecological corridor, whereas, the circuit model was introduced to identify the spatial scope of the ecological corridor. A total of 441 ecological corridors with a length of 6 774.9 km were identified in the study area. 49 ecological pinch points were identified by the current density of the ecological corridor. An optimal system was proposed for the space layout of ecological safety in the Gansu section of the Yellow River Basin with ""four axes, six regions, and multiple centers"", in order to form an ecological space structure with the functional, networked and regional layout. The findings can provide decision-making support for sustainable and ecosystem management in the upstream ecosystem of the Yellow River Basin. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The aim of the paper is twofold: i) to provide subject-specific insights by analyzing the current knowledge base in Africa given water-related challenges due to climate change, and ii) to offer methodological insights into how a knowledge base can be studied comprehensively. This study overcomes the limitations of existing studies by combining two different perspectives, namely a thematic focus on six societal challenges and a conceptual focus on five social innovation dimensions. It does so by undertaking an innovative qualitative analysis that combines both top-down and bottom-up perspectives. Top-down, it explores the extent to which five social innovation dimensions are included and addressed in policy agendas and action plans. Bottom-up, it explores the perception of African experts and practitioners in how these knowledge gaps should be addressed. The research identifies a strong bias in the policy arena towards water security versus other water-related societal challenges. Our research suggests that rather than focusing on traditional policy instruments, water-related societal challenges should be addressed by joint attention to all five social innovation dimensions.

Some of the recent scenarios warn that environmental salinization processes will continue to be exacerbated due to global climate change. The most relevant implications and side-effects in ecosystems under excessive salinity are destructive and long lasting (e.g. soil dispersion, water/soil hypersalinity, desertification, ruined biodiversity), often with non-feasible on site remediation, especially at larger scales. Agro-ecosystems are very sensitive to salinization; after a certain threshold is reached, yields and food quality start to deteriorate sharply. Additionally, salinity often coincides with numerous other environmental constrains (drought, waterlogging, pollution, acidity, nutrient deficiency, etc.) that progressively aggravate the threat to food security and general ecosystem resilience. Some well-proven, widely-used and cost-effective traditional ameliorative strategies (e.g. conservation agriculture, application of natural conditioners) help against salinity and other constraints, especially in developing countries. Remotely-sensed and integrated data of salt-affected areas combined with in situ and lab-based observations have never been so easy and rapid to acquire, precise and applicable on huge scales, representing a valuable tool for policy-makers and other stakeholders in implementing targeted measures to control and prevent ecosystem degradation (top-to-bottom approach). Continued progress in biotechnology and ecoengineering offers some of the most advanced and effective solutions against salinity (e.g. nanomaterials, marker-assisted breeding, genome editing, plant-microbial associations), albeit many knowledge gaps and ethical frontiers remain to be overcome before a successful transfer of these potential solutions to the industrial-scale food production can be effective. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agroecosystems; Alkalinity; Salinity; Salt stress; Soil amelioration","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Developing countries; Food supply; Water pollution; Conservation agricultures; Ecosystem degradation; Ecosystem resilience; Global climate changes; Marker-assisted breeding; Microbial associations; Nutrient deficiency; Salinization process; Ecosystems; calcium; magnesium; sodium; sodium chloride; agricultural ecosystem; alkalinity; environmental stress; salinity; salinization; soil remediation; acidity; concentration (parameter); desertification; drought; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem restoration; electric conductivity; electric current; environmental management; environmental protection; environmental salinization; evapotranspiration; food contamination; food industry; food quality; food security; greenhouse effect; hydraulic conductivity; magnetic field; measurement accuracy; osmotic stress; particle size; pH; physical chemistry; porosity; precipitation; priority journal; remote sensing; Review; salinity; seasonal variation; soil erosion; soil moisture; soil structure; soil temperature; vegetation; water content; waterlogging",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092091801

The approach is based on three steps. The following report describes each step and the application of the approach to a real case study in Tunisia. Water is a vital resource for our planet and for humankind. Biodiversity and ecosystems' preservation, human health, and food security as well as energy production, industrial development and economic growth are all dependent on water. The consequences of climate change and the actual projections of increasing water demand will affect water availability and quality in the coming years. About the Oil & Gas sector, this industry consumes and produces significant volumes of water. For this reason, energy companies must consider sustainable options for the use of this resource, especially in water stress areas. This can be achieved through: • A deep knowledge of the site water streams and of the context where the site is located. • Identification of improvements and initiatives that could reduce the water risk of the site. About water safeguarding, Eni is committed to pursue the following practices: • Water Conservation: Upstream Oil & Gas operations need significant quantities of water; a key element for its conservation includes the reduction of withdrawals and the efficiency in water use. • Water Reuse and Valorization: Upstream Oil & Gas operations must manage large volumes of wastewater, mainly Produced Water. Design solutions shall introduce and maximize the recycle of water with the adoption of suitable treatments, to make discharges compatible with the reuse in the same production cycle or by third parties (e.g., other plants, local communities), and pursue the opportunity to reuse industrial water, instead of discharging it as wastewater. For their deployment, Eni has defined and applied a methodological approach to support the definition of improvement and optimization initiatives of water management at the site level. The approach represents an application of a ""convergence approach"" which, starting from an overall view of the site, identifies opportunities, further and more detailed areas of analysis, and design projects that can improve water use, management, and reuse. The methodological approach is based on the following steps: • A country-based framework study on water resources, and water-related risks analysis at country and local level. • A Water Balance Assessment, gathering water qualitative and quantitative information and site framework details. • Definition of site initiatives for wastewater reuse and valorization, and for the optimization of water withdrawals, based on the above steps and considering local legislation. Through this approach, operational water risks exposure is analyzed in detail, allowing to address a wide range of opportunities for the improvement of water management, also through the development of new synergies with local communities. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Biodiversity; Climate change; Economics; Food supply; Gas industry; Gases; Oils and fats; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Rivers; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water recycling; Local community; Methodological approach; Oil gas; Optimisations; Real case; Reuse; Water balance; Water reuse; Water use; Waters managements; Water conservation",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127720355

The Ganga River enriches the fertility of floodplain through flooding every year. Farmers have been utilizing this fertility for growing crops by flood recession farming (FRF) since antiquity. In this practice, farmers use moisture and nutrient rich soil of the floodplains for growing crops after water levels recede and harvest them before flooding in the river. This ancient method of food production plays a pivotal role in human well-being and environmental conservation in the GRB. Using the data collected from the farmers living along the Ganga River in Varanasi, this study explores the potentials of FRF through the dimensions of livelihood provision, food security and environmental sustainability. Field visits, household surveys, and focus group discussions (FGDs) were used to collect data. Results indicated that various practices and methods of FRF system underpin not only the livelihood and food security of small and marginal farmers but also enrich the sustainability of the environment. Environmental sustainability was assessed in the context of agro-biodiversity conservation, water resource management, soil health maintenance, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. The study concludes that the full potentials of flood recession farming can be assessed through a comprehensive research about the different aspects of FRF and mainstreaming this practice in policy-making for sustainable food production. © 2021 The Authors","Flood recession farming; Floodplain; Food security; Ganga River; Livelihood; Sustainable agriculture",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108379891

It introduces Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in urban planning that are integrated with the aim to enhance urban resilience and to slow down the biodiversity decline, which can be applied in two areas: through the conception of new green neighbourhoods; and through the regeneration and re-greening of existing but neglected parts of the city, such as postindustrial brownfields or economically weak districts. Contact to nature is essential for human existence, urban wellbeing and a good quality of life. Green spaces in cities –big or small– all contribute to health and wellbeing. However, many cities, including in the U.S. and in Europe, do not offer residents easy access to green space within the city. Improving better access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks will deliver a large number of benefits, such as ecosystem services, better water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, with the potential to restore damaged ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and NBS help to keep cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microclimate. As most of our cities keep growing and warming, the scale of the issue is significant. For example, in 2020, cities in the European Union were home to over 70 percent of Europe’s population, and this figure is expected to increase to over 80 percent by the middle of the century.

Due to depletion of fossil fuels and undesirable changes of climatic conditions, increase in air and water pollution, mankind started exploring alternate and sustainable means of meeting growing energy needs. One of the options is to use renewable sources of fuel–biofuel. In this chapter the authors have reviewed and presented sustainability impact on production of biofuels. Authors further reviewed state-of-the-art gene editing technologies toward improvement of biofuel crops. The authors recommend a phased transition from first-generation biofuel, and an acceleration toward use of technology to drive adoption of second-generation biofuels.

During this pandemic, significant improvements in the quality of air and water resources have been noted. The tracking of SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, in wastewater allowed wastewater-based epidemiology for this disease. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the increased use of antimicrobials for personal hygiene and environmental disinfection can have serious consequences on the environment and public health. Air pollutants and greenhouse gases have been significantly reduced except for ozone that increased due to the decline in NOx. Tackling air pollution is important due to its role in spreading and worsening the COVID-19. Similarly, this pandemic has a strong impact on crop production systems, livestock industry, food supply chain and global food security. The zoonotic nature of this disease could change human interactions with wildlife and companion animals, but clear strategies are needed to safeguard both human health and biodiversity throughout the COVID-19 recovery.

Pakistan has energy requirements of more than 75 million tons of oil equivalent (MTOE) in 2019 which is experiencing exponential increase due to growing population and changing lifestyle. The country is currently relying on thermal energy and imported fossil fuels to meet energy requirements. The share of coal in primary energy has been increased in recent years. The construction and operational phase of energy projects have significant threats to environmental security due to soil erosion and compaction, chemical spills and debris disposal, air emissions, noise and wildfire. It also shapes the terrain by damaging vegetation cover, terrestrial ecosystems and wetlands. The impacts further include dislocation of species, disturbance in migratory corridors and changes in breeding areas of wildlife. These projects also affect the water quality and modify drainage patterns causing aesthetic disruption and changes. Archeologically and culturally important sites are also being disturbed on the pretext of improving socio-economic conditions. Furthermore, climate change is reshaping the nexus of energy with environmental security in Pakistan. Resultantly, there may be a paradigm shift due to energy insecurity, geopolitical conflicts in the region, consumer’s access to affordable energy, environmental injustice and insecurity.

Levels of production required for future food security cannot be met by further increases in inputs of non-renewable resources. The world’s food crops must therefore be managed in a sustainable way that maintains long-term ecological functioning, including nutrient, carbon and water cycles, soil quality, primary productivity, microbe-plant associations, pest and pathogen regulation, pollination and arable food web resilience. All of these are determined by agronomic practices at local and regional scales, and all are sustained by the abundance, diversity and functional composition of plants, microbes and invertebrates in the farmed ecosystem. Presence of viable populations and communities of these organisms is therefore essential for system resilience. Long-term sustainability must rely more heavily on the internal generation of products and regulatory ecosystem services than on external inputs. Fully closed systems are impossible to achieve in agriculture as the product is removed for human consumption. There is ample evidence, however, that semi-closed, regenerative, systems can harness the ecosystem services provided by functional biodiversity to enhance crop production whilst simultaneously improving environmental quality.

However, this ecosystem is potentially vulnerable to climate change (e.g., precipitation) and human activity (e.g., grazing). Despite this, the influences of precipitation and grazing on ecological functions of drought-prone grasslands in the Tianshan Mountains remain relatively unexplored. Therefore, we conducted a systematic field investigation and a clipping experiment (simulating different intensities of grazing) in a drought-prone grassland on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains in China to examine the influences of precipitation and grazing on aboveground biomass (AGB), soil volumetric water content (SVWC), and precipitation use efficiency (PUE) during the period of 2014–2017. We obtained the meteorological and SVWC data using an HL20 Bowen ratio system and a PR2 soil profile hydrometer, respectively. We found that AGB was clearly affected by both the amount and seasonal pattern of precipitation, and that PUE may be relatively low in years with either low or excessive precipitation. The PUE values were generally higher in the rapid growing season (April–July) than in the entire growing season (April–October). Overall, moderate grazing can promote plant growth under water stress conditions. The SVWC value was higher in the clipped plots than in the unclipped plots in the rapid growing season (April–July), but it was lower in the clipped plots than in the unclipped plots in the slow growing season (August–October). Our findings can enhance the understanding of the ecological effects of precipitation and grazing in drought-prone grasslands and provide data that will support the effective local grassland management. © 2020, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","aboveground biomass; climate change; human activity; precipitation use efficiency; soil volumetric water content; water stress","aboveground biomass; climate change; drought; ecosystem function; grassland; grazing; human activity; precipitation (climatology); soil profile; soil water; water content; water stress; Tien Shan",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090110536

The ever-increasing population pressure and changing climate have grave implications for the sustenance of human health and habitation in the foreseeable future. The region is confronted with numerous challenges related to forest degradation, land productivity, disaster risk, water management, biodiversity loss, erratic climatic patterns, as well as socio-political capacity. The limits of arable land have essentially been reached, while the need for enhancing production to sustain human nutritive requirements and livelihoods continues to increase. Hence, the intensification of agriculture has become a necessity rather than a choice. Yet, producing greater numbers of crops and quantities of food, fiber and other materials on the same parcel of land runs the risk of degrading the soil fertility, productivity and overall quality. Therefore, means to achieve this without irreversibly damaging the soil and land resource base have become imperative. To this end, agro-forestry, agro-slivi-pastoral systems, and the adoption of a variety of regenerative crops, soil and water management and conservation practices offer the potential to deliver multiple benefits without sacrificing the very resource upon which the human population depends. The need for ecologically sound and sustainable management of natural resources in the Himalayan region, as well as the adaptation of local communities to the impacts of climate change and measures for its mitigation, cannot be over-emphasized. This book presents findings on approaches to sustainable land management and the intensification of agriculture and animal husbandry related to soil organic matter management and carbon sequestration for multiple benefits; and the agroforestry as a crop diversification strategy with livelihood and climate mitigation/adaptation benefits, along with other aspects of forest, biodiversity and water resources management. The book deals with technical, socio-economic, policy and biodiversity issues related to the sustainable use and management of natural resources, namely forests, soil/land, water, crops, animal husbandry and diversity of flora/fauna, as well as disaster risk and vulnerability of communities in the Himalayan region.

In spite of spectacular success in food production over the years, it is a great challenge to sustain high production as well as enhance it further to meet the future requirement, as the population continues to grow steadily with an annual growth rate of 1.10% and expected to be 1.42 billion and 1.48 billion by 2025 and 2030, respectively, from 1.32 billion during 2017; coupled with enhanced consumption of food grains due to rising income, necessitating an increase of 4.5% and 15.7% by 2020 and 2030, respectively, over the present food production. It is a great challenge in view of climate change, diminishing and degrading land and water resources, increasing biotic and abiotic stresses and loss of bio-diversity.

Requisite assets such as a strong crop specific cultivar development programmes, 850 high yielding food crop varieties comprising 657 of cereals and 193 of pulses released during the last six years, robust and vibrant seed systems, quality regulatory mechanism, globally competitive seed sector and the largest arable land with 46 soil types across 15 agro-climatic zones favouring seed production of diverse crops are available for sustaining high food production and meet the future demand for seed and food. Ensuring availability of quality seed in adequate quantity though imperative, yet, itself is not enough to trigger the production if it is not coupled with achieving sufficient varietal diversity in seed chain preferably phasing out gradually the old and obsolete varieties and inducting recently developed high yielding and disease resistant varieties.

Fisheries species in tropical waters associate with a wide range of habitats, so assessing the dependency of fisheries on coral reefs is important for guiding fishery responses to coral reef degradation. This study aimed to determine how fisheries catches associate with coral reefs in Queensland, Australia. Queensland’s largest fisheries did not target fish associated with reefs, but specific sectors, particularly aquarium fisheries and commercial fisheries in the mid to northern region had a high dependence on species that use coral reefs. Regions that had a greater relative area of coral reefs had higher catches of species that depend on live coral, suggesting that coral area could be used to predict the sensitivity of a jurisdiction’s fisheries to bleaching. Dynamic analysis of stock trends found that coral trout and red throat emperor, the two largest species by catch for the reef line fishery, were at risk of overfishing if habitat loss caused declines in stock productivity. Management of fisheries that are highly dependent on reefs may need to adapt to declining productivity, but further research to support ongoing reforms in Queensland’s fisheries is needed to quantitatively link reef degradation to stock production parameters is needed. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"article; bleaching; coral reef; fishery; habitat; productivity; quantitative analysis; Queensland; throat; animal; Anthozoa; coral reef; ecosystem; environmental protection; fish; fishery; human; physiology; population dynamics; procedures; Queensland; sea food; tropic climate; Animals; Anthozoa; Conservation of Natural Resources; Coral Reefs; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Fishes; Humans; Population Dynamics; Queensland; Seafood; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093109332

The ecology and biology of locusts make them among the most devastating pests worldwide and hence the calls for actions to prevent the next outbreaks. The most destructive of all locust species is the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria). Here, we review the current locust epidemic 2020 outbreak and its causes and prevention including the green technologies that may provide a reference for future directions of locust control and food security. Massive locust outbreaks threaten the terrestrial environments and crop production in around 100 countries of which Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya are the most affected. Six large locust outbreaks are reported for the period from 1912 to 1989 all being closely related to long-term droughts and warm winters coupled with occurrence of high precipitation in spring and summer. The outbreaks in East Africa, India and Pakistan are the most pronounced with locusts migrating more than 150 km/day during which the locusts consume food equivalent to their own body weight on a daily basis. The plague heavily affects the agricultural sectors, which is the foundation of national economies and social stability. Global warming is likely the main cause of locust plague outbreak in recent decades driving egg spawning of up to 2–400,000 eggs per square meter. Biological control techniques such as microorganisms, insects and birds help to reduce the outbreaks while reducing ecosystem and agricultural impacts. In addition, green technologies such as light and sound stimulation seem to work, however, these are challenging and need further technological development incorporating remote sensing and modelling before they are applicable on large-scales. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the 2020 locust outbreak is the worst in 70 years probably triggered by climate change, hurricanes and heavy rain and has affected a total of 70,000 ha in Somalia and Ethiopia. There is a need for shifting towards soybean, rape, and watermelon which seems to help to prevent locust outbreaks and obtain food security. Furthermore, locusts have a very high protein content and is an excellent protein source for meat production and as an alternative human protein source, which should be used to mitigate food security. In addition, forestation of arable land improves local climate conditions towards less precipitation and lower temperatures while simultaneously attracting a larger number of birds thereby increasing the locust predation rates. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Agriculture; Climate; Food security; Locust; Prevention; Sustainability","biological control; crop production; drought; epidemic; food security; global warming; grasshopper; locust; migratory population; mitigation; nature-society relations; pest damage; pest outbreak; precipitation (climatology); protein; Acrididae; Africa; arable land; Article; auditory stimulation; biological pest control; Caelifera; chronology; climate change; controlled study; crop production; drought; Ethiopia; fat content; food security; greenhouse effect; hurricane; India; Kenya; life cycle; locust plague; meat; nonhuman; Pakistan; photostimulation; precipitation; priority journal; protein content; remote sensing; Somalia; spawning; spring; summer; temperature; United Nations; winter; animal; Caelifera; ecosystem; epidemic; food security; greenhouse effect; human; Ethiopia; India; Kenya; Pakistan; Somalia; Aves; Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus; Glycine max; Hexapoda; Orthoptera; Schistocerca gregaria; Animals; Disease Outbreaks; Ecosystem; Food Security; Global Warming; Grasshoppers; Humans; India; Kenya; Pakistan",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089816351

We find that effects of a climate or land-use driver (e.g., air temperature) on lake environment could be relatively consistent in directions, but consequential changes in a lake-environmental factor (e.g., water temperature) could result in either increases or decreases in fish catch in a given lake. A subsequent correlation analysis indicates that reductions in fish catch was less likely to occur in response to potential climate and land-use changes if a lake is located in a region with greater access to clean water. This finding suggests that adequate investments for water-quality protection and water-use efficiency can provide additional benefits to lake fisheries and food security. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"chlorophyll a; catch statistics; climate change; environmental factor; fish; food security; global change; lacustrine environment; lake; land use change; livelihood; scale effect; water quality; agriculture; air temperature; Article; Bayesian network; climate change; correlation analysis; environmental factor; fish; fishing; food security; human; lake; land use; Markov chain Monte Carlo method; mathematical model; mathematical phenomena; Monte Carlo method; plant water use; population density; precipitation; time series analysis; water quality; water temperature; animal; chemistry; climate change; ecosystem; fishery; growth, development and aging; lake; temperature; Animals; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Fishes; Humans; Lakes; Temperature; Water Quality",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085155511

Prolonged shortage of food had been a substantial challenge to the residents after Maria. Experiencing food insecurity in utero has been associated with negative health outcomes later in life. We aim to examine whether there is any alteration in the infant gut microbiome that is associated with prenatal food insecurity. Methods: We established a cohort of infants aged 2–6 months who were exposed in utero to Hurricane Maria near San Juan, Puerto Rico and examined the gut microbiota (n = 29) using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Results: Among the enrolled infants, 30% of their mothers experienced “post-Maria poor access to food” for at least 1 month during pregnancy. The relative abundance of gut Veillonella spp. is significantly decreased among infants who experienced prenatal food insecurity, compared to those who did not (adjusted p = 0.025). There is no significant difference observed by prenatal food insecurity at the microbial community level in this cohort. Conclusions: Our finding indicated that infants who experienced prenatal food insecurity post hurricane harbor microbial alternations of specific bacterial taxa, which may further influence the microbial maturation and place the individual at a high-risk health trajectory. Impact: We identified that in utero exposure to food insecurity post Hurricane Maria is associated with decreased abundance of Veillonella in the infant gut.Our findings indicated that infants who experienced prenatal food insecurity post hurricane may harbor alterations of specific bacterial taxa in their gut microbiota.This study showed the association between prenatal adverse exposure and alterations of gut microbiome early in life in the context of an extreme event.This study provided insights into the mechanisms underlying prenatal adverse exposure and increased disease risks later in life.Our findings will potentially raise awareness of the negative impact of extreme climate events on the unborn. © 2020, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.",,"bacterial DNA; bacterial RNA; drinking water; genomic DNA; RNA 16S; RNA 16S; Actinobacteria; Article; artificial milk; Bacteroidaceae; Bacteroidetes; Bifidobacteriaceae; breast feeding; breast milk; clinical article; cohort analysis; Enterobacteriaceae; female; Firmicutes; food insecurity; food security; gestational age; household; human; hurricane; infant; infant feeding; intestine flora; male; maternal nutrition; microbial community; microbial diversity; mother; nonhuman; population abundance; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; prevalence; priority journal; Proteobacteria; Puerto Rico; random forest; RNA sequencing; Veillonella; water insecurity; climate; metabolism; microflora; newborn; polymerase chain reaction; treatment outcome; Veillonella; Climate; Cyclonic Storms; Female; Food Insecurity; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Microbiota; Mothers; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Puerto Rico; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Treatment Outcome; Veillonella",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082196033

This fact tends to obscure the reality that most, if not all the global challenges, are closely interdependent and need a holistic approach to deal with them in a coherent and effective way. Likewise, society at large must be made fully aware that there will not be an enduring solution unless there is a change in the level of consumption of goods and energy in affluent countries. There is an increasing perception, understanding and concern in academic circles as well as in other sectors of society that the unsustainable production and consumption of natural resources need to be tackled by novel approaches. These combined efforts should ensure that they will be enacted in policy initiatives and in the actions that pave the way to building a global biodiplomacy.

The very creation and evolution of human civilizations depended on living along shorelines, serving as the source of food, water, and security. However, fear of water is just as deeply grained and cross-cultural as love of water. The unpredictable river and ocean landscapes have been domesticated along history with a special impact on ecosystems since the industrial era. Newcastle's waterfront, including the Hunter river estuary and the ocean shoreline are unique landscapes, which have been strongly modified due to land reclamation leading to the destruction of such a vulnerable ecosystem. As a consequence, city resilience is under threat due to the effects of unpredictable events, dynamics, forces of climate change, amplified without the natural protection of these water ecosystems. The methodology to present this research includes two primary steps. The first step was the creation of a data and map database to study the historic and current conditions, combined with future predictions, on urban, environmental, and flooding conditions in the Newcastle waterfront areas. All predictions are to identify and catalogue the worst scenarios in the event of a dramatic climate change evolution. The second step, which is still under development and contingent on funding, is the compilation of urban and architectonic adaptative strategies and evidence-based design guidelines that can be implemented and integrated with other environmental, urban and social sustainable strategies. The ultimate result will be a data and map catalogue linked with a set of design principles, strategies, and guidelines aligned with sustainable and achievable goals, to ensure coastal and riverbank adaptation and mitigation. The strategies will not only improve resilience, reduce vulnerability and risk, but enhance liveability in urbanised delta throughout an interdisciplinary approach, and also to ensure a more sustainable future. The problem of dynamic forces acting in estuary cities and its conflict with human habitation needs to be faced in an interdisciplinary manner, integrating different perspectives and approaches that consider current capacities, past events, and future predictions. The results of this project aim to meet those goals and is one step to help achieve a sustainable future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ecosystems; Estuaries; Forecasting; Hydrogeology; Land reclamation; Maps; Sustainable development; Current capacity; Design Principles; Evidence-based designs; Future predictions; Human civilization; Human habitation; Sustainable strategies; Vulnerable ecosystems; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097226978

This review paper provides an analysis of agroforestry as an integrated system embedded in complex relations between resource uses in the Water–Energy–Land–Food (WELF) nexus. Using the African Sahel region as a case study, the paper explains the need for understanding land management practices, such as agroforestry, through the lens of trade-offs and benefits inherent in the WELF nexus. Agroforestry practices are demonstrated to be valuable interventions leading to i) resilience to climate stresses, ii) water, energy, and food securities, iii) mitigation of resource-oriented harbingers of conflicts and iv) development opportunities. These goals can also yield valuable results in terms of promoting sustainable development, i.e. functional ecosystems, livelihoods, and human security. Two overarching sub-nexuses, namely agroforestry–food–energy and agroforestry–food–water–climate, are identified in the Sahelian context and conceptualized. Primarily, the trade-offs outlined within these sub-nexuses are fuelwood vs. crops, use of land for more forests vs. more cropping, and water availability for agroforestry vs. agroforestry impacts on the water cycle. Despite the positive outcomes and opportunities, agroforestry systems in the Sahel still face some challenges such as vague land use rights, inadequate capacities and lack of investments. Policy recommendations are synthesized at three levels. This synthesis involves remedies to lessen pressures at the interlinks of WELF resource use, overarching remedies in the two sub-nexuses, and remedies across all the sectors and issues for improving agroforestry outcomes. Optimal remedies stress the importance of choosing the right land, water and plant combinations as well as incorporating efficiency measures and alternative sources. A successful agroforestry system is characterized by a conducive environment at the farm level in terms of institutions, management, enhancing the farmer's capacity, and good infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agroforestry; Climate-smart agriculture; Land-use conflict; Sahel; Sustainable development; Water–Energy–Food nexus","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Investments; Land use; Sustainable development; Water resources; Agroforestry system; Efficiency measure; Integrated systems; Land management practices; Land use conflicts; Policy recommendations; Sustainable land managements; Water availability; Forestry; water; agroforestry; integrated approach; land management; management practice; sustainable development; agroforestry; climate resilience; crop; energy; environmental impact; environmental policy; food security; forest; land use; priority journal; Review; Sahel; sustainable development; water availability; water cycle; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087497651

The aim of this study was to determine the LULC changes of severely degraded land using high-resolution remote-sensing data from the last ~50 years in order to determine whether human activities have led to improvements or further land degradation. An area of 70 km2 near Cherrapunji in Northeast India, which receives 11,000 mm of rainfall annually and was deforested in historical times, was selected for this analysis. Despite severe land degradation, the population density of this area has been continuously increasing, standing at ~300 inhabitants km−2 in 2011. A visual interpretation technique, combined with field surveys, was used for LULC mapping, based on satellite images from the US Corona programme for 1965, pansharpened Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) images IRS-1D for 1998 and Google Earth for 2017. This analysis indicated the dominance of grassland (73.2%), with a small contribution of forest (17.6%), settlements (5.8%), mining (2.3%), cropland (0.7%) and water bodies (0.4%) in 2017. The LULC structure was the result of a largely degraded land contribution inherited from the past and the emergence of new driving forces behind land-use change. The LULC trends in 1965–2017 included a decrease of forest (4%) and grassland (5%), stability of cropland, and an increase of land-use classes which, in non-degraded land under a monsoonal climate, are usually of small extension, such as settlements (85%), mining (132%) and water bodies (525%). These changes reflect both, attempts to utilise existing environmental resources and to adapt to living in a degraded environment caused by growing human population. From the land degradation perspective, the trends in LULC change show two opposing directions––further land degradation mainly associated with the expansion of settlements and mining (accounting for ~79% of the total LULC changes), and land improvement and neutral change, including the recovery of natural vegetation and the construction of water bodies. The relationships between the LULC changes and direct measurements of biomass and carbon stocks of forest and grassland ecosystems indicated that their balance was negative for the Cherrapunji spur in 1965–2017. A strategy aimed at restoring the sustainability of the Cherrapunji spur environment should focus on the replacement of grassland by forest through the abandonment of uncontrolled grass burning, animal grazing and coal mining with the simultaneous provision of alternative gainful employment for the local population such as tourism and aquaculture. © 2020","Degradation; India; Land use; Society",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094978152

To radically redesign food systems to buffer against climatic disruptions, we focus on agroecological function, human health, and community well-being. Using arid North America (“Aridamerica”) as a laboratory for the future, we employed 18 criteria to select 17 desert plant genera with high potential as food crops. When integrated into perennial polycultures modeled after arid ecosystems and traditional knowledge, desert plants can stabilize yields, produce disease-preventing foods, and generate rural livelihoods. We envision food systems that can reduce disparities while enhancing resilience in a hotter, drier world. Summary: Climate disruptions and water scarcity are threatening food security and human well-being. We provide a framework for selecting a more diverse set of arid-adapted food crops to reduce food system vulnerabilities to climate change, climate-related illness, and economic disparities in arid lands. We constructed a list of candidate crops based on the diets of the Comcaac, O'odham, and Pima Bajo peoples of the Sonoran Desert. Representative genera were then screened for traits related to agroecological functionality, human health, community well-being, and agronomic suitability. Of the 154 species (86 genera) used by these Sonoran Desert Indigenous cultures, 101 species (80 genera) were more broadly used in Aridamerica, suggesting wide acceptability and value of desert plants for arid-adapted agriculture in North America. We highlight 17 genera with high potential to simultaneously improve agricultural resilience, human health, and community prosperity in the face of climate change, over a third of which are water-use efficient crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) succulents. Assembling these candidate crops into perennial polycultures coupled with solar energy and rainwater harvesting systems can maximize yield reliability while minimizing fossil fuel, agrichemical, and surface and groundwater use. Now is the time to invest in desert-adapted farming and food systems, with climate change already accelerating damages to agricultural landscapes. Biomimicry and traditional knowledge can aid in designing co-located food, water, and energy provisioning systems adapted to arid climates and scarce resources that improve agroecological and human health.

Ecosystem services from protected areas include producing wild food, supporting biodiversity and water cycles, regulating climate, and providing cultural services like better health, tourism, and legacy for future generations. In economic terms, the flows of ecosystem services provided by protected areas are worth hundreds of billions of dollars each year, well justifying the costs of managing these sites, but protected areas are suffering from environmental problems such as impacts from human population growth, rural poverty, growing demands for natural resources, land use change that degrades ecosystem productivity, invasive non-native species that harm natural ecosystems, and climate change that is affecting all ecosystems. Addressing these linked challenges will require mobilizing all parts of the economy, including the protected area estate. For example, protected areas can take a leadership role in rural development, expand the conservation estate to half of the planet through connectivity and improved management of more of the non-agricultural land, enhance the prominent role of protected areas in contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, encourage productive research on applying modern technology to protected areas management, seek broader private sector participation in conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services, and include protected areas as relevant parties in relevant trade and other international negotiations.

We revisit three widely-used process-based models: DeNitrification DeComposition (DNDC), DayCent, and the Pasture Simulation model (PaSim) and two watershed models: The Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Variable Infiltration Capacity Model (VIC), which are widely used to simulate C, nutrient and water cycles. We review their structures and ability as process-based models in representing key feedbacks among grazing management, SOM decomposition and hydrological processes in grazing lands. Then we review some significant advances in the use of models combining biogeochemical and hydrological processes. Finally, we examine challenges of incorporating spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability into modelling C and nutrient cycling in grazing lands and discuss their weakness and strengths. We also highlight key research direction for improving the knowledge base and code structure in modelling C and nutrient cycling in grazing lands, which are essential to conserve grazing lands and maintain their ecosystem goods and services. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agroecosystem; Coupling biogeochemical and hydrological modelling; Grasslands; Grazing management; Nutrient cycles; Soil carbon","Agriculture; Behavioral research; Biodiversity; C (programming language); Carbon; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Knowledge based systems; Nutrients; Petroleum prospecting; Soils; Sustainable development; Water pollution; Denitrification decompositions (DNDC); Environmental footprints; Hydrological process; Process-based models; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatiotemporal patterns; Temporal variability; Variable infiltration capacity models; Soil pollution; nitrogen; agricultural land; biogeochemistry; denitrification; grazing; greenhouse gas; knowledge; land management; nutrient cycling; soil and water assessment tool; soil carbon; spatiotemporal analysis; agroecosystem; biogeochemistry; carbon footprint; climate change; denitrification; environmental impact; grassland; grazing management; hydrological model; hydrology; leaching; microbial biomass; microbial growth; nutrient cycle; nutrient cycling; plant growth; priority journal; rangeland; Review; root respiration; simulation; soil erosion; water quality; watershed",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085982335

Whereas there are many studies on the resource requirements or environmental impacts of small islands, there are few efforts to integrate information that is often analysed separately. Metabolic analysis, beyond quantifying biophysical flows, studies how society transforms these flows to reproduce the identity of the whole. This study applies the Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) approach, to analyse the environmental and economic performance of different economic activities in the Mediterranean island of Menorca (Spain). The openness of the metabolic system (observed in the dependence on imports) and externalization of environmental impact are illustrated using the examples of the cheese and tourist industry. The results show that a higher economic performance in terms of value added is associated with activities in industry and services with a larger dependence on imports of “external resources” – fuel for transportation, milk for cheese, seasonal workers and “paying capacity” of tourists. This dependence reduces local environmental pressures and also adaptation capacity, since decisions made in Menorca may have limited impact elsewhere. Local agriculture depends less on external resources but it is limited by the low economic productivity of land and labour. An integrated analysis of the relations between metabolic rates and densities of flows in the different compartments of the society provides a holistic picture of sustainability issues and can contribute to decision-making by avoiding partial information. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Energy; Human activities; Mediterranean islands; MuSIASEM; Socio-ecological metabolism; Water","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Dairies; Decision making; Industrial economics; Landforms; Metabolism; Service industry; Sustainable development; Economic performance; Economic productivity; Ecosystem metabolisms; Environmental and economic performance; Environmental pressures; Global environmental problems; Resource requirements; Sustainability issues; Environmental impact; fuel; climate change; ecological economics; energy management; environmental impact; human activity; sustainability; tourism; water management; agriculture; Article; cheese; country economic status; ecosystem metabolic analysis; ecosystem monitoring; environmental impact assessment; environmental sustainability; food industry; milk; priority journal; seasonal worker; socioeconomics; Spain; tourism; traffic and transport; worker; Balearic Islands; Mediterranean Sea; Minorca; Spain",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086736635

Plants, fungi, and animals harvested from forests have long provided multiple benefits—for nutrition, health, income, and cultural purposes. Across the globe, the main element of “forest management” has been industrial wood production. Sourcing food from forests has been not even an afterthought but a subordinate activity that just happens and is largely invisible in official statistics. For many people, forests ensure a secure supply of essential foods and vital nutrients. For others, foraging forests for food offers cultural, recreational, and diversified culinary benefits. Increasingly, these products are perceived by consumers as being more “natural” and healthier than food from agricultural production. Forest-and wild-sourced products increasingly are being used as key ingredients in multiple billion dollar industries due to rising demand for “natural” food production. Consumer trends demonstrate growing interests in forest food gathering that involves biological processes and new forms of culturally embedded interactions with the natural world. Further, intensifying calls to “re-orient” agricultural production provides opportunities to expand the roles of forests in food production; to reset food systems by integrating forests and trees. We use examples of various plants, such as baobab, to explore ways forests and trees provide for food security and nutrition and illustrate elements of a framework to encourage integration of forests and trees. Forests and trees provide innovative opportunities and technological and logistical challenges to expand food systems and transition to a bioeconomy. This shift is essential to meet the expanding demand for secure and nutritious food, while conserving forest biodiversity. © 2020 by the authors.

However, unlike other components of the climate system, the impact of climate change on the groundwater system has only recently received attention. This focus is due to the realization that groundwater is a vital freshwater resource crucial to global food and water security, and is essential in sustaining ecosystems and human adaptation to climate variability and change. This paper synthesizes findings on the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the entire groundwater system and each component. Also, we appraise the use of coupled groundwater-climate and land surface models in groundwater hydrology as a means of improving existing knowledge of climate change-groundwater interaction, finding that most models anticipate decreases in groundwater recharge, storage and levels, particularly in the arid/semi-arid tropics. Reducing uncertainties in future climate projections and improving our understanding of the physical processes underlying models to improve their simulation of real-world conditions remain a priority for climate and Earth scientists. Despite the enormous progress made, there are still few and inadequate local and regional aquifer studies, especially in less developed regions. The paper proposes two key considerations. First, physical basis: the need for a deeper grasp of complex physical processes and feedback mechanism with the use of more sophisticated models. Second, the need to understand the socioeconomic dimensions of climate-groundwater interaction through multidisciplinary synergy, leading to the development of better groundwater-climate change adaptation strategies and modeling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation modeling; Climate change; Future considerations; Groundwater; Models; Physical basis; Socioeconomic dimension","Aquifers; Climate models; Earth (planet); Groundwater resources; Climate change adaptation; Climate variability and change; Complex physical process; Direct and indirect impacts; Future climate projections; Ground-water hydrology; Groundwater interaction; Less-developed regions; Climate change; aquifer; climate change; feedback mechanism; groundwater; hydrology; land surface; recharge; simulation",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086988336

Since the world's major crops are proving inadequate to supply the calories and nutrients for people in these areas, new crops are sought that can withstand harsh ecological environmental conditions. In the current trial, we assessed the growth and productivity of Tetragonia tetragonioides (Pallas) Kuntz. in a floating hydroponic system supplied with different seawater proportions (i.e. 15% and 30% seawater, EC = 9.8 and 18.0 dS m−1). Moreover, the effects of different salinity levels on mineral elements accumulation, production of osmotic solutes and secondary metabolites were determined, along with the salt removal capacity of the crop. The results indicated that plant growth was not affected by either of the seawater treatments used in this study. The increased leaf succulence and the reduction of both leaf area and specific leaf area with increasing salinity might represent an essential feature of this salt-tolerant species associated to the plants need of limiting transpiration. Low seawater treated plants showed a significantly higher biomass yield per liter of (sea)water used (117%) than the control. Under these conditions plants accumulated the highest amount of Mg (+31% and 48% in medium and high seawater treated plants compared with the control) and Cu (+14% and 30%, respectively) along with increasing proline and decreasing nitrate concentrations. By contrast, we found that seawater supply resulted in a Na-enriched leaf biomass that may represent an issue for human health. We concluded that Tetragonia tetragonioides can be grown in saline agriculture up to a salinity level characterized by an EC of 18 dS m-1 but further investigation is required to address Na accumulation in leaves. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Hydroponics; New Zealand spinach; Saline agriculture; Salt removing crop; Salt-tolerant crop; Seawater footprint; Seawater irrigation","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Crops; Ecosystems; Metabolites; Mineral industry; Minerals; Salt removal; Seawater; Water resources; Agricultural ecosystems; Environmental conditions; Essential features; Hydroponic systems; Nitrate concentration; Seawater supplies; Secondary metabolites; Specific leaf area; Plants (botany); agricultural ecosystem; biomass; crop production; food production; growth; salinity; vegetable; Tetragonia tetragonioides",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086407292

Agricultural scientists recognize that one of the best ways of alleviating the twin scourges of poverty and hunger is through agriculture, i.e., by increasing food production. JCI published a special issue on ‘Agricultural and Environmental Sustainability’ in 2007. In 2009–2010, several articles were published, which specifically addressed important water and agricultural sustainability strategies. In 2013–2014, numerous articles on combating climate change from the standpoint of agriculture were published. The issues at the core of JCI have also been enshrined in the United Nations’ ‘Sustainable Development Goals’ (SDGs), which were established in 2015.

Other than the general footprints, climate change negatively impacts the overall performance of the plants either directly or indirectly by changing the intensity and frequency of abiotic stress factors. As diverse plant species growing in higher altitudes of the region are open to very unfavourable and harsh conditions, especially low temperature, these provide insights into different adaptive mechanisms for abiotic stress tolerance and can be dissected for the same. From time to time, efforts have been made to develop stress resilient crops or climate smart agriculture. A holistic approach comprising the fields of agricultural biotechnology, socio-cultural integrity and crop ecology is going to provide an excellent insight into climate change mitigation strategies and plant abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms in the delicate ecosystem.

This study examined 40 different options, implemented through land management, value chains, or risk management, for their relative impacts across 18 Nature's Contributions to People (NCPs) and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We find that a relatively small number of interventions show positive synergies with both SDGs and NCPs with no significant adverse trade-offs; these include improved cropland management, improved grazing land management, improved livestock management, agroforestry, integrated water management, increased soil organic carbon content, reduced soil erosion, salinization, and compaction, fire management, reduced landslides and hazards, reduced pollution, reduced post-harvest losses, improved energy use in food systems, and disaster risk management. Several interventions show potentially significant negative impacts on both SDGs and NCPs; these include bioenergy and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, afforestation, and some risk sharing measures, like commercial crop insurance.

To help overcome these challenges, we developed the HydroLorica soil-landscape evolution model that simulates soil development by explicitly modeling the spatial water balance as a driver of soil- and landscape-forming processes.

Changes in the duration and intensity of droughts can significantly impact ecosystems, food and water security, agriculture, hydropower, and the socioeconomics of a region. We characterize the duration and intensity of snow droughts (snow water equivalent deficits) worldwide and differences in their distributions over 1980 to 2018. We find that snow droughts became more prevalent, intensified, and lengthened across the western United States (WUS). Eastern Russia, Europe, and the WUS emerged as hot spots for snow droughts, experiencing ∼2, 16, and 28% longer snow drought durations, respectively, in the latter half of 1980 to 2018. In this second half of the record, these regions exhibited a higher probability (relative to the first half of the record) of having a snow drought exceed the average intensity from the first period by 3, 4, and 15%. The Hindu Kush and Central Asia, extratropical Andes, greater Himalayas, and Patagonia, however, experienced decreases (percent changes) in the average snow drought duration (−4, −7, −8, and −16%, respectively). Although we do not attempt to separate natural and human influences with a detailed attribution analysis, we discuss some relevant physical processes (e.g., Arctic amplification and polar vortex movement) that likely contribute to observed changes in snow drought characteristics. We also demonstrate how our framework can facilitate drought monitoring and assessment by examining two snow deficits that posed large socioeconomic challenges in the WUS (2014/2015) and Afghanistan (2017/2018). © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Life in these regions is profoundly challenged by harsh environmental conditions of water limitation, high levels of solar radiation and temperature fluctuations, along with soil salinity and nutrient deficiency, which have serious consequences on plant growth and survival. In recent years, plants that grow in such extreme environments and their naturally associated beneficial microbes have attracted increased interest. The rhizosphere, rhizosheath, endosphere, and phyllosphere of desert plants display a perfect niche for isolating novel microbes. They are well adapted to extreme environments and offer an unexploited reservoir for bio-fertilizers and bio-control agents against a wide range of abiotic and biotic stresses that endanger diverse agricultural ecosystems.

Given the susceptibility of global water cycle to climate change and anthropogenic influence, the synthesis of science with sustainable reservoir operation strategy is required as part of an integrated approach to water management. Here, we take advantage of new approaches combining state-of-the-art computational models and a novel satellite-based reservoir operation scheme to spatially and temporally decompose Lake Victoria's TWS, which has been dam-controlled since 1954. A ground-based lake bathymetry is merged with a global satellite-based topography to accurately represent absolute water storage, and radar altimetry data is integrated in the hydrodynamic model as a proxy of reservoir operation practices. Compared against an idealized naturalized system (i.e., no anthropogenic impacts) over 2003–2019, reservoir operation shows a significant impact on water elevation, extent, storage and outflow, controlling lake dynamics and TWS. For example, compared to Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, reservoir operation improved correlation and root mean square error of basin-wide TWS simulations by 80% and 54%, respectively. Results also show that lake water storage is 20% higher under dam control and basin-wide surface water storage contributes 64% of TWS variability. As opposed to existing reservoir operation schemes for large-scale models, the proposed model simulates spatially distributed surface water processes and does not require human water demand estimates. Our proposed approaches and findings contribute to the understanding of Lake Victoria's water dynamics and can be further applied to quantify anthropogenic impacts on the global water cycle. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","GRACE; Human impacts; Lake water dynamics; Radar altimetry; Reservoir operation; River routing scheme; Terrestrial water storage","Climate change; Digital storage; Geodetic satellites; Lakes; Mean square error; Reservoir management; Topography; Water management; Anthropogenic impacts; Anthropogenic influence; Computational model; Gravity recovery and climate experiment datum; Integrated approach; Reservoir operation; Root mean square errors; Terrestrial water storage; Reservoirs (water); carbon dioxide; fresh water; ground water; lake water; methane; surface water; water; anthropogenic effect; dam; freshwater; GRACE; hydrological cycle; hydrological modeling; reservoir impoundment; water management; water storage; Africa; Article; biodiversity; climate change; computer model; controlled study; dam (barrier); economic development; evaporation; flooding; food security; freshwater environment; hydrodynamics; hydrology; hydropower; Kenya; priority journal; remote sensing; river; social evolution; species richness; Tanzania; terrestrial surface waters; topography; Uganda; water cycle; water management; water quality; water supply; East African Lakes; Lake Victoria",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083289963

However, the alteration of flow connectivity, degradation, and disruption of physical processes that sustain different levels of organisms (e.g., primary producers) are threats that affect aquatic biodiversity and the productivity of these habitats. Therefore, the large scale assessment of freshwater habitats for proactive water resources planning and the development of climate change mitigation and resource management strategies is essential. However, such monitoring and assessment is complicated by the inaccessibility of many large wetland systems during times of inundation, making in situ sampling unfeasible at a time when high levels of aquatic primary producers are generating food and energy sources for higher order consumers. To understand the physical dynamics of aquatic primary producers and freshwater habitats (1991–2019) during such times in a large floodplain river in northern Australia (Gilbert catchment), this study integrated Landsat-derived modified normalised difference water index and normalised difference vegetation index in a classification tree model. Thereafter, key hydrological drivers (rainfall and river discharge) of floodplain productivity and connectivity were assessed using a range of multivariate techniques. Results show that the floodplain had a high aquatic plant biomass during the summer wet season based on the correlation between aquatic biomass accumulation (hot spots) and inundation (r=0.83 @ phase lag < 1 month) during such period. River discharge (r=0.68 @ lag = 1 month) at downstream Gilbert catchment appear to be a relatively stronger indicator of hot spots of floodplain biomass accumulation as opposed to local rainfall (r=0.57 @ lag = 3 months). While the downstream discharge explains a significant proportion of variability in the leading orthogonal mode of rainfall (r=0.83), statistical relationships developed between discharge/rainfall and the distribution of aquatic primary producers confirm that both rivers (flow) and local rainfall are key optimal predictors of inundation and sites of primary producers with river flows being a better indicator of the latter. It is therefore argued that hydro-meteorological fluctuations will be key constraints on freshwater habitats and the growth of primary producers, albeit, human disturbance of flow can impact on floodplain productivity. As illustrated in this study, such constraints are reflected in the spatial patterns and changing characteristics (connectivity and spatial heterogeneity) of hot spots of primary producers and freshwater habitats (Palustrine, Lacustrine, and Riverine ecosystems). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aquatic vegetation; Classification tree; Floodplain; Image classification; Landsat; Macrophytes","Aquatic organisms; Banks (bodies of water); Biodiversity; Biomass; Catchments; Climate change; Ecosystems; Floods; Hydrogeology; Image classification; Productivity; Rain; Runoff; Vegetation; Water; Wetlands; Aquatic vegetation; Classification trees; Flood plains; LANDSAT; Macrophytes; Rivers; aquatic plant; biodiversity; catchment; climate change; disturbance; floodplain; freshwater environment; growth; image classification; Landsat; macrophyte; rainfall; river discharge; satellite data; Australia",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082742365

The broad contours of the agricultural production system in the country have been defined by the need to achieve food security which calls for close attention to rice-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system of the Indo- Gangetic Plains (IGP) whose sustainability is under threat. Degradation of natural resources, severe biotic and abiotic stresses specially drought, floods, pest infestations with accompanying impacts on biodiversity and agricultural productivity are the major constraints to agricultural development. Further, climate change has gained significant global attention over the past decade due to concerns of deleterious long-term impacts on agriculture, water supply, human welfare, regional and political stability. All the related issues need to be addressed on priority, with particular emphasis on soil-carbon through a holistic approach. As the strategy brings focus on income of farmers, the agricultural technology needs to move from “Production oriented-Green Revolution” to “Farmer’s Income oriented- Revolution” and environmentally sustainable farming. Therefore, for long-term sustainability in agriculture, 4 pillars/ components (good agricultural practices, climate-change mitigation and adaptation, diversification of highvalue crops and biodiversity management) needs to be addressed properly, more importantly good agricultural practices (GAP). The GAPs are based on the principles of risk prevention, risk analysis, sustainable agriculture, and integrated crop management (ICM), which are of utmost importance in present time. The GAPs for agricultural sustainability are reduced tillage, conservation agriculture, resource-conservation technologies (RCTs), erosioncontrol measures, diversified cropping system, micro-irrigation, balanced fertilization, manuring, watershed management, organic farming, and integrated farming systems etc. Now that the vision is to impart income security to the farmers of the country, diversification of the system across all the sub-sectors of agriculture assumes importance which is, indeed a de-risking mechanism capable of negotiating both endogenous and exogenous risks associated with the system. The effective and efficient management of agro-biodiversity is also essential through management of genebanks, science-led innovations; livelihood, food and nutrition security though crop diversification, use of lesser-known crops and wild relatives in crop improvement; dealing appropriately with quarantine, biosafety and bio-security. © 2020, Indian Society of Agronomy.

It is of great practical importance in the basin to allocate water resources for ensuring the security of food production, and to formulate effective science-based agro-ecological management policies to address climate change impacts due to the probable effects of future changing environment on regional ET. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model were first driven by the downscaled climate data from three IPCC representative concentration pathways (RCPs) that have been projected by five General circulation models (GCMs) in the Coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) and the water-saving irrigation scenario to project ET per unit area, we then added to the model the upper and lower limits of the appropriate agricultural scale that considered the ecological health to simulate the behaviour of total ET for the period 2021–2050. Finally 12 case study scenarios were used to separate the effects of climate change and human activity on total ET. The results showed that total ET can be significantly decreased by &gt;1.22 × 108 m3 when the RCP-water-saving irrigation scenarios were combined with the appropriate agricultural scale. The results suggest that the best set of strategies to reduce agricultural water consumption is to reduce the area of arable land through consideration of ecosystem health and aggressively utilize water-saving agricultural technology to counter the increased ET brought about by future climate change in the Heihe agricultural region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Appropriate agricultural scale; Evapotranspiration; Heihe agricultural region; RCP scenarios; SWAT model; Water-saving irrigation","Climate models; Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Water conservation; Water supply; Appropriate agricultural scale; Heihe agricultural region; RCP scenarios; SWAT model; Water-saving irrigation; Climate change; climate change; CMIP; ecosystem health; evapotranspiration; general circulation model; human activity; hydrological cycle; river basin; soil and water assessment tool; China; Gansu; Hei River",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075339595

Traditionally, in freshwater environments many investigations have been directed to the study of pelagic microalgae (“phytoplankton”) and periphyton (i.e., photosynthetic and mixotrophic protists) through the use of light microscopy (LM). While the number of studies on bacterioplankton communities have shown a substantial increase after the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches, the study of the composition, structure, and spatio-temporal patterns of microbial eukaryotes in freshwater environments was much less widespread. Moreover, the understanding of the correspondence between the relative phytoplankton abundances estimated by HTS and LM is still incomplete. Taking into account these limitations, this study examined the biodiversity and seasonality of the community of eukaryotic microplankton in the epilimnetic layer of a large and deep perialpine lake (Lake Garda) using HTS. The analyses were carried out at monthly frequency during 2014 and 2015. The results highlighted the existence of a rich and well diversified community and the presence of numerous phytoplankton taxa that were never identified by LM in previous investigations. Furthermore, the relative abundances of phytoplankton estimated by HTS and LM showed a significant relationship at different taxonomic ranks. In the 2 years of investigation, the temporal development of the whole micro-eukaryotic community showed a clear non-random and comparable distribution pattern, with the main taxonomic groups coherently distributed in the individual seasons. In perspective, the results obtained in this study highlight the importance of HTS approaches in assessing biodiversity and the relative importance of the main protist groups along environmental gradients, including those caused by anthropogenic impacts (e.g., eutrophication and climate change). © Copyright © 2020 Salmaso, Boscaini and Pindo.","amplicon sequence variants (ASVs); deep lakes; eukaryotic microplankton; exact sequence variants (ESVs); high-throughput sequencing; Lake Garda; phytoplankton; protists","amplicon; article; biodiversity; climate change; eukaryote; eutrophication; high throughput sequencing; human impact (environment); lake; microplankton; microscopy; nonhuman; phytoplankton; protist; seasonal variation; taxonomic rank; writing",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085166299

Observations from an Australian case study are used to describe urban governance approaches capable of supporting regenerative urbanism. The regenerative urbanism concept is associated with macro-scale urban and transport planning that shapes different urban fabrics (walking, transit, automobile), as the underlying infrastructure of each fabric exhibits a different performance, with automobile fabric being the least regenerative. Supporting urban systems based upon regenerative design principles at different scales (macro, meso and micro) can deliver deep and dramatic outcomes for not just reducing the impact of the grand challenges but turning them into regenerative change.

According to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) special report 2019, the global mean surface (land and ocean) temperature has been increased by 0.87 °C while mean of land surface air temperature has increased by 1.53 °C since 1850-2015. Climate change is affecting food security and human life due to warming, changing precipitation patterns, and the greater frequency of some extreme events. The main cause of global warming is the continuous increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) like CO2, CH4, N2O and fluorinated gases due to several anthropogenic activities. Therefore, reducing the increasing concentration of GHG is necessary to slow down global warming and climate change. Among several options of greenhouse mitigation, application of biochar into the soil is gaining popularity due to several advantages over other options. Biochar is a highly stable form of carbon derived from pyrolysis of biomass at relatively low temperatures. Application of biochar into the soil has been reported to provide multiple benefits like increase in crop yield, nutrient and water use efficiency and several environmental benefits. Recalcitrant nature, relatively higher carbon content and easily available feedstock make biochar a highly sustainable and quick option for carbon sequestration into the soil. Biochar application into the soil not only helps in carbon sequestration but also provides a better option for managing agricultural residues. The application of biochar has also reported for reducing a considerable amount of methane and nitrous oxide emission from the agricultural field due to its priming effect on the soil. Biochar yield, physical properties, and carbon content varies with the type of feedstock and pyrolysis condition. Therefore, the rate of carbon sequestration and mitigation of greenhouse gas is also highly variable, however, the biochar application ultimately leads to a positive contribution towards climate change mitigation. However, most of the reported benefits are confined to laboratory and field trial at institute level, widespread adoption of biochar on farmer's field is still lacking. In the present chapter, all the aspects of biochar towards carbon sequestration and greenhouse mitigation have been well discussed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Crop residue; Global warming; Greenhouse gas",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088883486

But the water cycle is also being modified by humans at an unprecedented scale and rate. A holistic understanding of freshwater's role for Earth system resilience and the detection and monitoring of anthropogenic water cycle modifications across scales is urgent, yet existing methods and frameworks are not well suited for this. In this paper we highlight four core Earth system functions of water (hydroclimatic regulation, hydroecological regulation, storage, and transport) and key related processes. Building on systems and resilience theory, we review the evidence of regional-scale regime shifts and disruptions of the Earth system functions of water. We then propose a framework for detecting, monitoring, and establishing safe limits to water cycle modifications and identify four possible spatially explicit methods for their quantification.

In this study, we assessed vulnerability to climate change among maize-dependent smallholders in three districts of Ethiopia. Household socio-demographic factors, land use system, access to food, natural hazard, livelihood strategy and social network data were collected and subsequently analysed by the livelihood vulnerability index and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Vulnerability Index approaches. Results show that within the same production system, smallholder farmers experience different degrees of climate change vulnerability. This variation in climate change vulnerability is highly and significantly explained by very localized socio-economic factors such as household educational level, access to drought-resistant crop varieties, extent of family ties with social groups and local organizations, and quality of rural water supply and health infrastructures along with biophysical factors like land size and soil fertility status. It is, therefore, suggested that recognizing smallholder farmers’ relative vulnerability to climate change provides a range of effective coping strategies that would help to better build household resilience capacity and promote sustainable livelihood development. Hence, policymakers and development organizations need to focus on better strengthening human and institutional capacity through enhanced education and continuous training on climate change impact, and efficient and sustainable intensification through crop rotation, fertilizer use, rainwater harvesting and farm diversification that increase productivity by restoring soil and agroecosystem health. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Africa; Coping strategy; Resilience capacity; Sustainable livelihood; Vulnerability index","agricultural ecosystem; climate change; coping strategy; crop rotation; index method; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; livelihood; maize; smallholder; soil fertility; vulnerability; Ethiopia; Zea mays",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049563326

For rice ecosystems defined by water regime (irrigated lowland, rainfed lowland, upland), we discuss crop establishment, water saving methods, and mechanised production. The importance of germination and crop establishment in direct-seeded rice is emphasised, followed by an outline of environmental and genetic influences on phenological development and shoot and root growth. Crop growth is further analysed in terms of capture and efficiency in the use of radiation, water, and nitrogen, with a brief description of other nutrients. Sink-source limitation in grain yield examines how the grain sink develops and how source supply is used to fill the grain. Case studies of sink-source limitation show how more recent varieties, including hybrids, have increased both sink size and assimilate supply to achieve higher yield. In response to abiotic factors, the effects of water deficit, increased CO2 concentration, submergence, high temperature, low temperature, and salinity are reviewed. The chapter identifies six topics for future research: adaptation to reduced water input in irrigated systems; adaptation to drought in rainfed lowland rice; adaptation for mechanised farming; factors determining grain set; enhancing yield potential; and enhancing head rice yield. With increased pressure on global food security because of increasing human population, scarcity of water, greater reliance on more marginal land, and climate change, the identified topics for research in rice physiology under rice-based systems must be assigned the highest priority because of vulnerability of poor subsistence farmers and consumers reliant upon rice as their staple food. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Abiotic stress; Aerobic rice; Alternate wetting and drying; Direct seeding; Grain yield; Mechanisation; Nitrogen; Rainfed lowland rice; Rice; Sink-source limitation",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126410890

Grasslands are a key component contributing to the productivity of grazing animals but also provide basic food production via livestock grazing for herder survival. Grazing is the most basic means of grassland utilization but is considered one of the more important disturbance factors controllable by humans that has a universal and profound impact on the grassland ecosystem due to animal density and over grazing. For Alpine grasslands, it is not clear what grazing intensity (GI) can be achieved to improve plant biodiversity and vegetative nutritional value while improving sheep productivity. This field experiment was conducted for 7 yr comparing the impact of different GI on vegetation community characteristics, nutritional value, and sheep growth performance on the Alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The GI measured were: Control: 0 sheep/ ha; Low: 3.7 sheep/ha; Medium: 5.3 sheep/ha; and Heavy: 7.6 sheep/ha. The grazing experiment started in 2008, but experimental data collection and analyses were collected for the final 4 yr of 2015 through 2018. All grazing intensities &gt;0 sheep/ ha reduced (P &lt; 0.05) plant height (27%, 46%, and 48%, respectively, for 3.7, 5.3, and 7.6 sheep/ha), ground coverage (16%, 24%, and 48%), and above ground biomass (2%, 42% and 53%) of the various plant communities while increasing (P &lt; 0.05) the grass community density (individuals/m2) compared to a nongrazed Control. With increasing GI, the community height, coverage, and above-ground biomass decreased (P &lt; 0.05), and the plant community density increased then decreased (P &lt; 0.05) compared to Control. As GI increased, the available community biomass nutritional quality increased (P &lt; 0.05). Comprehensive analysis showed that the community density (quantity) and nutritional quality were the highest when the GI was 5.3 sheep/ha. The higher the GI, the greater the grass's nutritive value with lower above-ground net primary production (ANPP). When GI was the highest, the average daily gain (ADG) per hectare was the highest in the short term, but the highest GI endangers the ANPP and profitability of the grassland grazing ecosystem in the long term. Targeting a moderate GI (5.3 sheep/ha) can provide 78% of the ADG per hectare of the highest GI, which meets the requirement of maintaining a sustainable grazing grassland. © The Author(s) 2020.

Monitoring of long-term soil moisture trends has proven useful for managing water resource allocation and developing solutions to global water security challenges. Thus, we examine annual trends in surface soil moisture throughout the U.S. Great Plains region from 1987 to 2016 using data from NASA's observation- driven SPoRT-LIS land surface model at 3 km resolution.

In arid environments, plant primary productivity is generally low and highly variable both spatially and temporally. Resources are not evenly distributed in space and time (e.g., soil nutrients, water), and depend on global (El Niño/ Southern Oscillation) and local climate parameters. The launch of the Sentinel2-satellite, part of the European Copernicus program, has led to the provision of freely available data with a high spatial resolution (10 m per pixel). Here, we aimed to test whether Sentinel2-imagery can be used to quantify the spatial variability of a minor tussock grass (Enneapogon spp.) in an Australian arid area and whether we can identify different vegetation cover (e.g., grass from shrubs) along different temporal scenarios. Although short-lasting, the Enneapogon grassland has been identified as a key primary food source to animals in the arid environment. If we are able to identify and monitor the productivity of this species remotely, it will provide an important new tool for examining food resource dynamics and subsequent animal responses to them in arid habitat. Methods. We combined field vegetation surveys and Sentinel2-imagery to test if satellite spectral data can predict the spatial variability of Enneapogon over time, through GLMMs. Additionally, a cluster analysis ('gower' distance, 'complete' method), based on Enneapogon seed-productivity, and total vegetation cover in October 2016, identified three clusters: bare ground, grass dominated and shrub dominated. We compared the vegetation indices between these different clusters from October 2016 to January 2017. Results. We found that MSAVI2 and NDVI correlated with the proportion of Enneapogon with seeds across the landscape and this relationship changed over time. Both vegetation indices (MSAVI2 and NDVI) were higher in patches with high seed-productivity of Enneapogon than in bare soil, but only in October, a climatically-favorable period during which this dominant grass reached peak seed-productivity. Discussion. MSAVI2 and NDVI provided reliable estimates of the heterogeneity of vegetation type across the landscape only when measured in the Austral spring. This means that grass cover is related to seed-productivity and it is possible to remotely and reliably predict food resource availability in arid habitat, but only in certain conditions. The lack of significant differences between clusters in the summer was likely driven by the short-lasting nature of the vegetation in the study and the sparseness of the grass-dominated vegetation, in contrast to the shrub vegetation cluster that was particularly well measured by the NDVI. Conclusions. Overall, our study highlights the potential for Sentinel2-imagery to estimate and monitor the change in grass seed availability remotely in arid environments. However, heterogeneity in grassland cover is not as reliably measured as other types of vegetation and may only be well detected during periods of peak productivity (e.g., October 2016). © 2020 Funghi et al.","Arid environment; Behavioral ecology; Remote sensing; Sentinel 2; Vegetation survey","article; cluster analysis; desert; ecology; grass; grassland; habitat; human; human experiment; nonhuman; productivity; quantitative analysis; satellite imagery; seed yield; shrub; soil; spectroscopy; spring; summer; vegetation",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089354502

Many estuaries of world relevance are fed by the HKH watersheds affecting global biodiversity, biomass and carbon sequestration, but also human civilizations! The productivity of rivers and their estuaries can affect human well-being, entire nations, the global economy and even trigger warfare. Here an overview is shown for river outflows, the major estuaries in the HKH region such as the Yellow Sea, the Mekong, the Sea of Okhotsk, the deltas of the Ganges and the Indus. Central Asian wetlands fed by rivers but not ending in oceans are also covered in this assessment, e.g. Aral and Balkash Lakes. While mapping the HKH area has been ongoing for centuries, precise maps of the dynamic wetlands and estuaries, within a good time frame and available - are rare making impact assessment tricky. Even for tsunami forecasts (where human lives are lost and precise coastline maps are needed with a 1 m accuracy or better) such data rarely exist. Man-made climate change- namely melting glaciers, floods and brackish water inflow - are creating major changes in those millennia-old life-systems and human societies.

More-over, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are at risk of falling short of their intended targets. The difficulties will only be made worse as the climate and economic burdens grow. A growing literature suggests that the problems largely stem from the non-productive use of resources which erode our social and economic well-being-especially over the long haul. These huge inefficiencies include the non-productive use of capital, materials, water, food, and especially energy. One assessment notes that, depending on how we ignore global ecosystems or, more hopefully, how we might build up a more healthy and resilient environmental capacity, ""the global value of ecosystem services can decline by $51 trillion/yr or increase by $30 trillion/yr"" by the year 2040 (with values in 2007 dollars). At the same time, moving to a smarter and more productive use of all resources requires a larger number of institutional changes. Such changes range from the use of new metrics to assess future opportunities to an array of policies and perspectives that promote these changes. In this special issue we review a number of different ways that institutional changes might create opportunities in which all resources might be managed more productively. While no single special issue can cover all elements of the necessary institutional changes, nor can even a series of books on the topic, this is another step forward to open up thinking more along the lines of human and cultural dimensions toward a better understanding of how resources might be more productively used for social and economic benefits. © 2020 Editorial Board of the Journal Economic Policy.","Energy and climate policies; Energy productivity; Institutional change; Resource productivity",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084407647

Coastal waters have experienced progressive warming, acidification, and deoxygenation that will intensify this century. At the same time, there is a scientific consensus that the public health, recreation, tourism, fishery, aquaculture, and ecosystem impacts from harmful algal blooms (HABs) have all increased over the past several decades. The extent to which climate change is intensifying these HABs is not fully clear, but there has been a wealth of research on this topic this century alone. Indeed, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) approved in September 2019 was the first IPCC report to directly link HABs to climate change. In the Summary for Policy Makers, the report made the following declarations with “high confidence”: • Harmful algal blooms display range expansion and increased frequency in coastal areas since the 1980s in response to both climatic and non-climatic drivers such as increased riverine nutrients run-off. • The observed trends in harmful algal blooms are attributed partly to the effects of ocean warming, marine heatwaves, oxygen loss, eutrophication and pollution. • Harmful algal blooms have had negative impacts on food security, tourism, local economy, and human health. In addition, the report specifically outlines a series of linkages between heat waves and HABs. These statements about HABs and climate change and the high levels of confidence ascribed to them provides clear evidence that the field of HABs and climate change has matured and has, perhaps, reached a first plateau of certainty. While there are well-documented global trends in HABs being promoted by human activity, including climate change, individual events are driven by local, regional, and global drivers, making it critical to carefully evaluate the conditions and responses at appropriate scales. It is within this context that the first Special Issue on Climate Change and Harmful Algal Blooms is published in Harmful Algae. © 2019 The Author","Climate change; Deoxygenation; Global warming; Harmful algal blooms; Ocean acidification","algal bloom; aquaculture; climate change; ecosystem; human; Aquaculture; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Harmful Algal Bloom; Humans",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076844683

The study included analyses of sediment geochemistry, subfossil diatoms and cladocerans, and macrofossils. Results were compared with the historical record of human activities in the catchment, pollen analysis and paleoclimate inferences from the lake. During the first 750 years of the record (1000–1750 CE), a time of relatively low human activity, lake productivity and biodiversity were strongly related to climate. During the Little Ice Age (1550–1800 CE), lake productivity and diatom diversity were constrained by cold climate. A century of climate warming (1780–1880 CE) initiated an increase in productivity. Accelerated human settlement after 1850 CE, however, had an even stronger impact on productivity, mediated by increased agriculture and/or forestry, which led to greater nutrient loading of the lake. Similarly, diatoms in the lake responded to the rise in temperature, but increasing human activity also had a moderate impact on the diatom community, which displayed weak signs of nutrient enrichment. From 1980 to 1990 CE onwards, lake productivity declined as a consequence of a recent decrease in human activity and changing land use. The human-induced increase in lake productivity starting ca. 1850 CE propagated through the food web and increased consumer productivity, as reflected by greater accumulation rates of cladocerans, trichopterans and turbellarians. The cladoceran community was likely under top-down control of fish, as indicated by changes in size structure and diversity. Our study showed that increasing human activity during the settlement period had a stronger impact on lake productivity than did climate. Furthermore, the slight human-mediated increase in nutrient loading had different impacts on productivity and biodiversity in the study lake. This study demonstrates that even relatively small changes in human activities in watersheds can have measurable impacts on nutrient-poor lakes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Cladocera; Climate; Diatoms; Land use; Macrofossils; Scandinavia","biodiversity; catchment; crustacean; diatom; food web; historical record; human activity; oligotrophic environment; paleoclimate; Scandinavia; Bacillariophyta; Cladocera; Trichoptera; Turbellaria",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075403881

The SDGs provide an operational framework to consider urbanization globally, while providing local mechanisms for action and careful attention to closing the gaps in the distribution of health gains. While health and well-being are explicitly addressed in SDG 3, health is also present as a pre condition of SDG 11, that aims at inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities. Health in All Policies (HiAP) is an approach to public policy across sectors that systematically takes into account the health implications of decisions, seeks synergies, and avoids harmful health impacts in order to improve population health and health equity. HiAP is key for local decision-making processes in the context of urban policies to promote public health interventions aimed at achieving SDG targets. HiAPs relies heavily on the use of scientific evidence and evaluation tools, such as health impact assessments (HIAs). HIAs may include city-level quantitative burden of disease, health economic assessments, and citizen and other stakeholders' involvement to inform the integration of health recommendations in urban policies. The Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal)'s Urban Planning, Environment and Health Initiative provides an example of a successful model of translating scientific evidence into policy and practice with regards to sustainable and healthy urban development. The experiences collected through ISGlobal's participation implementing HIAs in several cities worldwide as a way to promote HiAP are the basis for this analysis. Aim: The aim of this article is threefold: To understand the links between social determinants of health, environmental exposures, behaviour, health outcomes and urban policies within the SDGs, following a HiAP rationale;to review and analyze the key elements of a HiAP approach as an accelerator of the SDGs in the context of urban and transport planning; A nd to describe lessons learnt from practical implementation of HIAs in cities across Europe, Africa and Latin-America. Methods: We create a comprehensive, urban health related SDGs conceptual framework, by linking already described urban health dimensions to existing SDGs, targets and indicators. We discuss, taking into account the necessary conditions and steps to conduct HiAP, the main barriers and opportunities within the SDGs framework. We conclude by reviewing HIAs in a number of cities worldwide (based on the experiences collected by co-authors of this publication), including city-level quantitative burden of disease and health economic assessments, as practical tools to inform the integration of health recommendations in urban policies. Results: A conceptual framework linking SDGs and urban and transportplanning, environmental exposures, behaviour and health outcomes, following a HiAP rationale, is designed. We found at least 38 SDG targets relevant to urban health, corresponding to 15 SDGs, while 4 important aspects contained in our proposed framework were not present in the SDGs (physical activity, noise, quality of life or social capital). Thus, a more comprehensive HiAP vision within the SDGs could be beneficial. Our analysis confirmed that the SDGs framework provides an opportunity to formulate and implement policies with a HiAP approach. Three important aspects are highlighted: 1) the importance of the intersectoral work and health equity as a cross-cutting issue in sustainable development endeavors;2) policy coherence, health governance, and stakeholders' participation as key issues; A nd 3) the need for high quality data. HIAs are a practical tool to implement HiAP. Opportunities and barriers related to the political, legal and health governance context, the capacity to inform policies in other sectors, the involvement of different stakeholders, and the availability of quality data are discussed based on our experience. Quantitative assessments can provide powerful data such as: Estimates of annual preventable morbidity and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) under compliance with international exposure recommendations for physical activity, exposure to air pollution, noise, heat, and access to green spaces;the associated economic impacts in health care costs per year; A nd the number of preventable premature deaths when improvements in urban and transport planning are implemented. This information has been used to support the design of policies that promote cycling, walking, public, zero and low-emitting modes of transport, and the provision of urban greening or healthy public open spaces in Barcelona (e.g. Urban Mobility, Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plans, or the Superblocks's model), the Bus Rapid Transit and Open Streets initiatives in several Latin American cities or targeted SDGs assessments in Morocco. Conclusions: By applying tools such as HIA, HiAP can be implemented to inform and improve transport and urban planning to achieve the 2030 SDG Agenda. Such a framework could be potentially used in cities worldwide, including those of less developed regions or countries. Data availability, taking into account equity issues, strenghtening the communication between experts, decision makers and citizens, and the involvement of all major stakeholders are crucial elements for the HiAP approach to translate knowledge into SDG implementation. ©2019 The Author(s).","City planning; Environmental health; Health equity; Health impact assessments; Health in all policies; Health promotion; Policy making; Sustainable development goals; Transportation; Urban health","health impact; health policy; policy implementation; public health; social indicator; sustainable development; transportation planning; urban planning; urbanization; air pollution; Article; city planning; climate change; conceptual framework; cycling; disability-adjusted life year; environmental exposure; environmental resilience; food security; health behavior; health care cost; health equity; health impact assessment; health promotion; human; industrialization; lifelong learning; morbidity; noise pollution; physical activity; premature mortality; priority journal; public policy; sanitation; social determinants of health; stakeholder engagement; sustainable agriculture; sustainable development; thermal pollution; traffic and transport; urban health; walking; water management; global health; sustainable development; Africa; Europe; Latin America; Global Health; Health Equity; Health Impact Assessment; Humans; Public Policy; Sustainable Development; Urban Health",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077094005

Water storage in soils of the Plateau has direct impacts on food security, human health and ecosystem function. Despite extensive research on the behavior and function of soil water in the Plateau, there is no state-of-the-art review that presents research achievements, gaps and future perspectives. This paper reviews the advances in soil water research and highlights future research needs and challenges in the Loess Plateau, and thereby provides informed decision on sustainable water management. We report that considerable efforts have been made to investigate: i) soil water movement and hydraulic property estimation in the typical loess regions; ii) spatial and temporal variations in soil water content and storage at multiple scales; iii) dried soil layers induced by excessive water use from unreasonable artificial revegetation; and iv) soil water availability and water carrying capacity of typical vegetation types on the Loess Plateau. These studies have greatly enhanced our understanding about the fundamental characteristics, spatio-temporal patterns and natural and anthropogenic controls of soil water distribution and water cycles in the Loess Plateau, which in turn have important implications for the regulation and management of water resources toward sustainable ecological construction. Based on the identified key issues and future research priorities, recommendations were drawn to address unsolved problems, including: i) processes and mechanisms controlling water transport and interactions within the groundwater–soil–plant–atmosphere continuum; ii) how soil hydrological processes couple nutrient cycles in response to climate change and human activities; and iii) development of quantitative models across spatial scales for modeling changes in thresholds of soil water carrying capacity for vegetation.

For the protection of water resources under global change conditions, specific research needs for prediction, monitoring, assessment and abatement of multiple stressors emerge with respect to maintaining human needs, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Collaborative European research seems an ideal instrument to mobilize the required transdisciplinary scientific support and tackle the large-scale dimension and develop options required for implementation of European policies. Calls for research on minimizing society’s chemical footprints in the water–food–energy–security nexus are required. European research should be complemented with targeted national scientific funding to address specific transformation pathways and support the evaluation, demonstration and implementation of novel approaches on regional scales. The foreseeable pressure developments due to demographic, economic and climate changes require solution-oriented thinking, focusing on the assessment of sustainable abatement options and transformation pathways rather than on status evaluation. Stakeholder involvement is a key success factor in collaborative projects as it allows capturing added value, to address other levels of complexity, and find smarter solutions by synthesizing scientific evidence, integrating governance issues, and addressing transition pathways. This increases the chances of closing the value chain by implementing novel solutions. For the water quality topic, the interacting European collaborative projects SOLUTIONS, MARS and GLOBAQUA and the NORMAN network provide best practice examples for successful applied collaborative research including multi-stakeholder involvement. They provided innovative conceptual, modelling and instrumental options for future monitoring and management of chemical mixtures and multiple stressors in European water resources.

Coordinated efforts are often deemed critical to minimize the trade-offs while maximizing the synergies in the use and the effective analysis of the interlinkages among food, energy, and water within urban ecosystems. Data are collected and transformed into useful information through different indicators, which are often applied to guide several policies in the urban domain. However, their different nature now asks for a critical reanalysis to collate them into different groups, understanding their guiding principles and identifying possible gaps for further policy- and design-oriented studies.

Besides the nutritional benefits of increased fruit consumption, however, the ways agroforestry affects human health are rarely articulated. This review makes that link. We analyze the pathways through which tree-based farm and landscape change affect food and nutrition security, the spread of infectious disease, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, and human migration in Sub-Saharan Africa. The available evidence suggests that, despite some increased risks of infectious disease, agroforestry is likely to improve a diverse range of pressing health concerns. We therefore examine the factors determining agroforestry use and identify three drivers of social and environmental change that will determine the future uptake of agroforestry in the region. Thirty percent of Sub-Saharan Africa's cropland has at least 10% tree cover. The available evidence indicates that agroforestry drives environmental change, which can improve a diverse range of pressing health concerns such as malnutrition, spread of infectious disease, prevalence of non-communicable disease, and human migration. This, however, does not always apply: transdisciplinary, participatory approaches are needed to dive more deeply into specific land-management systems to identify synergies and tradeoffs among health outcomes. © 2019 The Authors","Africa; agroforestry; climate change; food security; infectious diseases; migration; non-communicable disease; nutrition; planetary health; urbanization","agroforestry; climate change; food security; health impact; infectious disease; migration; noncommunicable disease; nutrition; urbanization; Sub-Saharan Africa",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086385765

This paper aims to present the capacity building approach and applications designed to fill these gaps and empower decision makers and practitioners in using EO data and GIT through information education and training. The capacity building approach consists of four components: assessment, design, implementation, and monitoring (ADIM). The assessment component focuses on identifying the needs and priorities of capacity building for targeted groups or institutions. The design component develops training content in order to execute the plan in coordination with subject matter experts (SME). The implementation component executes the capacity building activity in any of these four formats—standard training, training of trainers, on-the-job training, and exposure learning. The monitoring component helps to identify the participants' expectations, learning achievements, and feedback so as to improve future capacity building events. In the application of ADIM, we conducted needs assessment in four countries, designed 26 types of capacity building contents and implemented 39 capacity building events. A range of thematic topics—from agriculture and food security, water resources and hydro-climatic disasters, land use, land cover and ecosystem, weather and climate services, to crosscutting issues—were covered in the events. Altogether, the activities reached out to over 1,000 individuals (35% of them women) from over 200 unique institutions in 30 countries. Institutional capacity was built for universities in Afghanistan and Bangladesh to design and deliver courses independently. The capacity of partner agencies were built to co-design and co-develop data and applications. The approach also experienced challenges in the nomination process and in identifying women participants due to the lack of women professionals in the field and in the respective agencies. The ADIM approach and its workflow focused on bridging the gap between the current trend and progression in EO and GIT fields and the existing state of capacity of the agencies involved in the decision-making process. It promoted gender equity, adopted frontier technologies, engaged SMEs and provided sustainable solutions, which are starting to bring success stories in the region. © Copyright © 2019 Thapa, Matin and Bajracharya.","capacity building; GIT; HKH region; informal education; SERVIR; SME",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074630219

The Sierra Nevada, USA is a large social-ecological system facing a tipping point that could result in major ecosystem changes. A century of fire suppression and climate change have set the stage for mega-disturbances that threaten biodiversity, human life and values, ecosystem services, and forest persistence. Stakeholders face multidimensional and often contentious trade-offs with costs and benefits that can be mismatched in space and time. If compromises cannot be reached, the status quo is likely to continue, resulting in the conversion of large portions of a 100 000 km2 predominately mixed-conifer forest ecosystem to a chaparral-dominated ecosystem. We describe the outcomes of a continuation of the ecological status quo on biodiversity, cultural history, fire management, recreational value, and climate control, including indirect effects on water and food security and recreation. The social-ecological ramifications of such a future are undesirable for most stakeholders. Therefore, we contend that forest management conflicts should be framed in terms of the cost of failure of negotiations among stakeholders. Specifically, negotiations may benefit from (1) stakeholders quantifying their definitions of success and failure, (2) quantification of trade-offs and recognition of their multidimensionality, and (3) allowing for solutions that are heterogeneous in space and time. This approach may help stakeholders navigate the wicked problem of managing Sierra Nevada forests and other complex social-ecological systems. © 2019 The Author(s).

The soil security concept is applied to two contrasting soil landscape systems with varying climate, landform and soil types. Previous methodologies for assessing land and soil capability are combined within the soil security conceptual approach. The land and soil capability methodologies are used to assess how the soil condition changes in response to the stresses and forcing associated with land management and land and soil degradation processes. It is the soil capability that defines how the soil condition changes between the reference state of the soil condition, or the genoform, and the soil condition under land use, or the phenoform. The conclusion is that soil capability, which is one of the dimensions used to apply the soil security concept, is a complex dimension and has several aspects or further facets to be considered to achieve sustainable land management. It is apparent that in assessing soil capability, the following facets are relevant. I: The capacity of the soil to provide ecosystem services to meet the global challenges outlined for Soil Security. II: The stability of the soil condition to land degradation processes resulting from the effects of land management practices and the environmental stresses on the soil. III: The capacity to recover following degradation. Facets II and III can be considered the resilience. An important conclusion is that the soil capability cannot be assessed without taking into account features of the landscape including climate and landform. Two examples from south eastern Australia of the application of these facets of soil capability to on-ground situations are presented. The Cowra Trough Red Soils in the Australian wheat belt are a set of soils, primarily contributing to meeting the global challenge of food security. The major degradation processes threatening the stability of these soils are water erosion and soil acidification. The Kosciusko National Park in the Snowy Mountains region is primarily contributing to meeting the challenges of water security for the irrigation industry in the Murray Darling Basins and energy security through the production of hydroelectricity. The set of soil landscapes also contributes to biodiversity protection and human health and well-being. The major degradation processes threatening the stability of these soils and their capacity to meet the global challenges are water and wind erosion. A major limitation is the poor capacity of these soils to recover once degraded. Identifying the main ecosystem services provided by the two examples, together with the major risks of land degradation can clarify extension, economic and policy aspects of sustainable land management for the two sets of soil landscapes. For the Cowra Trough Red Soils, management of water erosion and soil acidification are essential for maintaining the contribution of the area to food security. For the Kosciusko National Park, the control of water and wind erosion are essential to maintain the contribution of the area to water and energy security. © 2019 by the authors.","Acidification; Energy security; Food security; Land use; Resilience; Soil capability; Soil landscapes; Soil security; Water erosion; Water security","acidification; ecosystem resilience; land management; land use change; landscape structure; soil degradation; water erosion; water planning; wetland management; wind erosion; Australia; Australian Alps; Cowra; Darling Basin; Murray-Darling Basin; New South Wales; Snowy Mountains; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073800181

We have developed a roadmap for evaluating the contribution of both private- and public-good ecosystem services generated by agricultural soils to societal welfare. The approach considers the needs of decision-makers at different levels, from farmers to policy-makers. This we achieve through combining production functions-to quantify the impacts of alternative management practices on agricultural productivity and soil ecosystem services-with non-market valuation of changes in public-good ecosystem services and benefit-cost analysis. The results show that the net present value to society of implementing soil-friendly measures are substantial, but negative for farmers in our study region. Although we apply our roadmap to an intensive farming region in Sweden, we believe our results have broad applicability, because farmers do not usually account for the value of public-good ecosystem services. We therefore conclude that market outcomes are not likely to be generating optimal levels of soil ecosystem services from society's perspective. Innovative governance institutions are needed to resolve this market failure to safeguard the welfare of future generations. © 2019 by the authors.","Benefit-cost analysis; Climate change; Food security; Natural capital; Nutrient retention; Policy; Soil carbon; Valuation","agricultural practice; agricultural science; agricultural soil; climate change; decision making; food security; management practice; natural capital; policy making; soil carbon; soil ecosystem",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073625523

We show one emblematic study case of pedotechniques applied in Sicily (Italy). Aims of the investigation were: i) stressing threats to soil security derived by the generation of anthropogenic soils, ii) assessing the economic sustainability of pedotechniques and table grape production, taking into consideration only the internal factors and excluding the external economic contributions that are allocated to social sustainability and iii) stressing the role of soil science to focus on “economic value” to the soil ecosystem services and degradation processes. Results highlight that soil transformations allow for considerable investment costs. The highest productivity and the consequent higher profitability of the cultivation amortize the start-up costs. From the other side transformations could trigger considerable deterioration of both soil ecosystem services and environmental quality.

The objective of the current study is to assess the livelihood practices and adaptive capacity of a mountainous region of Pakistan, the Balakot, where people are highly vulnerable to climatic changes. The study uses a triangulation method to explore various issues and options of climate change risks sand adaptation and impact of well-being on resilience capacity and livelihood strategies. For this purpose, ten focus group discussions (FGDs) with carefully selected key informants and structured interviews with randomly selected 200 local households are conducted to evaluate different hazards and their associated livelihood effects. It is observed that the changing climate has significantly influenced livelihoods of the local community in the recent past through resource degradation, gradual unavailability of sufficient basic services (quantity and quality of drinking water, crop food diversity, fuel wood, and non-timber forest products), low agricultural productivity, and social inequity viz. income distribution, health, education, and food storage. Such a brunt is felt disproportionately more by poor households due to their low adaptive capacity to climate change with constrained livelihood resources. The study emphasizes the need for targeted efforts to move from coping strategies to adaptations among people considering their social inequalities. Timely information sharing, livelihood diversification and preservation of livelihood resources such as crop and forest production, livestock grazing, creating awareness on the pace, and pattern of climate change in the region and subsequent role of adaptation options are major interventions that should be emphasized by the public bodies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Assessment; Degradation; Development; Mitigation; Natural resources; Vulnerable","adaptive management; climate change; coping strategy; developing world; environmental change; environmental conditions; environmental risk; mountain region; natural resource; nature-society relations; triangulation; vulnerability; drinking water; agriculture; animal; climate change; crop; family size; forest; human; income; information processing; livestock; Pakistan; procedures; randomization; rural population; Agriculture; Animals; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Drinking Water; Family Characteristics; Focus Groups; Forests; Humans; Income; Livestock; Pakistan; Random Allocation; Rural Population",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068912716

Rice, wheat, and maize are the major staple crops consumed globally. Drought, waterlogging, heat, salinity, and mineral toxicity are the key abiotic stresses drastically affecting crop yield. Conventional plant breeding approaches towards abiotic stress tolerance have gained success to limited extent, due to the complex (multigenic) nature of these stresses. Progress in breeding climate-resilient crop plants has gained momentum in the last decade, due to improved understanding of the physiochemical and molecular basis of various stresses. A good number of genes have been characterized for adaptation to various stresses. In the era of novel molecular markers, mapping of QTLs has emerged as viable solution for breeding crops tolerant to abiotic stresses. Therefore, molecular breeding-based development and deployment of high-yielding climate-resilient crop cultivars together with climate-smart agricultural practices can pave the path to enhanced crop yields for smallholder farmers in areas vulnerable to the climate change.

In this study, a water resources allocation and food production (WF)optimization is developed for regional sustainability under multiple uncertainties. A hybrid two-stage fuzzy programming with Laplace criterion (TSFL)is proposed into a WF optimization to handle hybrid indeterminacies, which can increase the robustness of decision-making. The WF optimization with proposed TSFL method can be applied to a practical case of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH)region. The obtained results associated with water deficits, optimal water allocations, inadequate capacities of food production, rational irrigation schedules, sound livestock scales, optimized agricultural possessing layouts and system benefits under various population-economy regulation scenarios can be obtained. The results can reflect the tradeoff between economic development and water-food safety; meanwhile, they can display risk violation of WF plan under various credibility levels and Laplace criterions (based on TSFL method).

Those areas represent practically one third of the country's native vegetation and are well known for their role in biodiversity protection and in the provisioning of a wide range of ecosystem services for landowners and society. Despite their relevance, this instrument has been criticized by part of the agribusiness sector and its representatives in the Brazilian Congress. The Legal Reserve requirement is said to be too restrictive and to impede the full expansion of agricultural activities, and thus to be detrimental for the development of the country. Here, we critically analyze the arguments employed in the justification of a recently proposed bill that aims to completely extinguish Legal Reserves. We demonstrate that the arguments used are mostly unsupported by data, evidence or theory, besides being based on illogical reasoning. Further, we synthesize the principal benefits of Legal Reserves, including health and economic benefits, and emphasize the importance of these reserves for water, energy, food, and climate securities, in addition to their primary function of assisting in the maintenance of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We also highlight that Legal Reserves are a key-component for effective and less expensive nature-based solutions, and thus should be considered as assets for the development of Brazil rather than liabilities.

Shortages of water have impaired economic development by disrupting regimes of river flows, ecosystem functioning and food security. Excessive surface and groundwater withdrawals have almost reached the threshold. The current withdrawals of total water (4700 km3·y−1) suggest the imbalance of water use and renewal rates in the world’s river basins. The water security issues are further intensified by phosphate and nitrate pollution from land use and climate change. Today, about 400 million people worldwide experience extreme shortages of water for daily use. Limited availability of water which needs to meet the basic needs of hygiene and sanitation for consumption and other uses has increased competition among users. While the society demands more water-intensive goods and services, the ecosystems are however left behind, consequently leading to increased conflicts and insecurity.

Thus, high-resolution records of climate and environmental variability from anthropologically significant locations can help test these hypotheses. Sedimentary sequences recovered by the Olduvai Gorge Coring Project (OGCP) help evaluate climatic and environmental changes at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania through the analyses of various biogeochemical proxies. The stratigraphic sequence of OGCP Core 2A can be correlated with horizons associated with hominins and is chronologically constrained by distinctive dated horizons, such as the Bed I Basalt and Tuff IB. The lacustrine interval from 76.6 to 86.9 m depth is ideally suited for high-resolution analyses of biogeochemical proxies as it is rich in organic carbon (&gt;1%TOC). The hydrogen isotopic composition of nC31 in this interval of OGCP Core 2A records the effects of precession-driven wet-dry cycles on the terrestrial environment that led to alternations between woodland and grassland ecosystems, comparable to those documented by previous investigations of outcrop analogues at Olduvai. Here, we examine stratigraphic variations in the abundance of biomarkers (C28 steradienes, C17 and C23 n-alkanes, C27 and C28 A-norsteranes, fern-8-ene, and chromans) derived from aquatic organisms (algae, cyanobacteria, sponges, macrophytes, etc.) to determine the response of Paleolake Olduvai to climate variability. In general, these aquatic biomarkers reflect the productivity of the lake environment and exhibit the same precession-driven wet-dry cycles recorded by terrestrial biogeochemical signatures. However, they also provide evidence of abrupt (&lt;~300 yr) changes in lake level and corresponding aquatic communities superimposed on the longer-term Milankovitch cycles. Thus, evidence for climatic variability is manifested through the pacing and intensity of changes in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, but the different rates of the responses on land and in the aquatic environment potentially had a complex influence on water and food resources that were important factors for hominin habitation and evolution. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarkers; Hominin evolution; Lacustrine sediments; Sediment core","anthropogenic effect; aquatic environment; biochronology; biogeochemistry; chronosequence; climate variation; environmental change; historical record; hominid; human evolution; isotopic composition; lacustrine deposit; paleoenvironment; paleohydrology; Pleistocene; sediment core; sedimentary sequence; Arusha [Tanzania]; Olduvai Gorge; Tanzania; algae; Cyanobacteria; Filicophyta",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064277173

Furthermore, improving access to medicines is included in sustainable development goal 3. However, the concept of security of supply has mostly been applied to food, water and energy. Diversity of supply, vulnerability to disruption, expenditure, infrastructure, stability of exporting countries, ownership of production, price stability, access and equity, affordability, intellectual property, safety and reliability of supply, and countries’ capacity to adapt to market changes are all elements of security of supply. Based on these elements, we assessed security of supply for insulin, since access to insulin is a global problem. We found that three multinational companies, in Denmark, France and Germany, control 99% of the value of the global insulin market. Prices and affordability of insulin and access to it vary considerably between countries. Some countries are vulnerable to insulin shortage because they import insulin from only one source. Many countries spend large amounts of money on insulin and costs are increasing. Some countries lack an adequate infrastructure for procurement, supply chain management and distribution of insulin. Applying the security of supply concept to insulin showed that diversification of suppliers needs to be fostered. Global health actors should adopt a security of supply approach to identify medicines that are susceptible to supply issues and address this concern by strategic promotion of local production, strengthening regulatory harmonization, and adding local products to the World Health Organization’s programme on prequalification of medicines. © 2019, World Health Organization.

The Initiative underlines the role of soil organic matter (SOM) in addressing the three-fold challenge of food and nutritional security, adaptation to climate change and mitigation of human-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. It sets an ambitious aspirational target of a 4 per 1000 (i.e. 0.4%) rate of annual increase in global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, with a focus on agricultural lands where farmers would ensure the carbon stewardship of soils, like they manage day-to-day multipurpose production systems in a changing environment. In this paper, the opportunities and challenges for the 4 per 1000 initiative are discussed. We show that the 4 per 1000 target, calculated relative to global top soil SOC stocks, is consistent with literature estimates of the technical potential for SOC sequestration, though the achievable potential is likely to be substantially lower given socio-economic constraints. We calculate that land-based negative emissions from additional SOC sequestration could significantly contribute to reducing the anthropogenic CO2 equivalent emission gap identified from Nationally Determined Contributions pledged by countries to stabilize global warming levels below 2 °C or even 1.5 °C under the Paris agreement on climate. The 4 per 1000 target could be implemented by taking into account differentiated SOC stock baselines, reversing the current trend of huge soil CO2 losses, e.g. from agriculture encroaching peatland soils. We further discuss the potential benefits of SOC stewardship for both degraded and healthy soils along contrasting spatial scales (field, farm, landscape and country) and temporal (year to century) horizons. Last, we present some of the implications relative to non-CO2 GHGs emissions, water and nutrients use as well as co-benefits for crop yields and climate change adaptation. We underline the considerable challenges associated with the non-permanence of SOC stocks and show how the rates of adoption and the duration of improved soil management practices could alter the global impacts of practices under the 4 per 1000 initiative. We conclude that the 4 per 1000 initiative has potential to support multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. It can be regarded as no-regret since increasing SOC in agricultural soils will contribute to food security benefits that will enhance resilience to climate change. However, social, economic and environmental safeguards will be needed to ensure an equitable and sustainable implementation of the 4 per 1000 target. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Soil organic carbon","Agricultural robots; Agronomy; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economics; Environmental regulations; Food supply; Forestry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Organic carbon; Sustainable development; Adaptation to climate changes; Carbon sequestration; Climate change adaptation; Environmental safeguard; Soil management practices; Soil organic carbon; Stabilize global warming; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Soils; action plan; adaptive management; agricultural land; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; emission; food security; greenhouse gas; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil organic matter; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039546363

Here, we investigate the mechanisms behind climate change effects on the reproductive traits of highly mobile, West Australian bird taxa, the forest red-tailed black cockatoo Calyptorhynchus banksii naso (FRTBC). Using a dataset of annual breeding frequency spanning 19 yr, in combination with hydrological, climatological, and remotely sensed data, we modeled the effects of environmental variation on the annual breeding frequency of FRTBCs. We found several significant relationships between annual breeding frequency of FRTBCs and environmental variation. While the model, which included a proxy for the availability of the cockatoo's primary food source and the previous season's rain, explained 49% of annual breeding frequency, there were also direct and indirect effects of heatwaves and forest productivity. Forest red-tailed black cockatoo breeding appears to be linked to the spatiotemporal availability of its primary food sources, the fruit from the tree species, marri Corymbia calophylla and jarrah Eucalyptus marginata. However, Western Australia is experiencing significant climate change, with increases in temperature and declines in rainfall altering the phenologies of these species, while declining rainfall is affecting the vegetation structure of the region. As drought events and temperatures are anticipated to increase over the region, it is expected that the food resources during the breeding season for cockatoos will become increasingly limited in time and space, thus threatening the persistence of this iconic species. This scenario is likely to be representative of many other situations where wide-ranging species rely on patchy food resources in a changing environment. As global biodiversity is increasingly threatened, this study presents timely evidence illustrating how climate change is affecting the persistence of a threatened, mobile species, and what the implications are for mobile species around the world. © 2019 The Authors.","climate change; ecological modeling; heatwaves; hydrology; mobile species; remote sensing; reproductive behavior",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065039290

The response mechanism of NPP to land use and climate changes is essential for food security and biodiversity conservation but lacks a comprehensive understanding, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. To this end, taking the middle-reaches of the Heihe River Basin (MHRB) as an example, we uncovered the NPP responses to land use and climate changes by integrating multisource data (e.g., MOD17A3 NPP, land use, temperature, and precipitation) and multiple methods. The results showed that (a) land use intensity (LUI) increased, and climate warming and wetting promoted NPP. From 2000 to 2014, the LUI, temperature, and precipitation of MHRB increased by 1.46, 0.58°C, and 15.76 mm, respectively, resulting in an increase of 14.62 gC/m 2 in annual average NPP. (b) The conversion of low-yield cropland to forest and grassland increased NPP. Although the widespread conversion of unused land and grassland to cropland boosted both LUI and NPP, it was not conducive to ecosystem sustainability and stability due to huge water consumption and human-appropriated NPP. Urban sprawl occupied cropland, forest, and grassland and reduced NPP. (c) Increase in temperature and precipitation generally improved NPP. The temperature decreasing &lt;1.2°C also promoted the NPP of hardy vegetation due to the simultaneous precipitation increase. However, warming-induced water stress compromised the NPP in arid sparse grassland and deserts.

Whilst adaptation to climate change is necessary to ensure food security and protect livelihoods of poor farmers, mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can lessen the extent of climate change and future needs for adaptation. Many agricultural practices can potentially mitigate GHG emissions without compromising food production. India is the third largest GHG emitter in the world where agriculture is responsible for 18% of total national emissions. India has identified agriculture as one of the priority sectors for GHG emission reduction in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Identification of emission hotspots and cost-effective mitigation options in agriculture can inform the prioritisation of efforts to reduce emissions without compromising food and nutrition security. We adopted a bottom-up approach to analyse GHG emissions using large datasets of India's ‘cost of cultivation survey’ and the ‘19th livestock census’ together with soil, climate and management data for each location. Mitigation measures and associated costs and benefits of adoption, derived from a variety of sources including the literature, stakeholder meetings and expert opinion, were presented in the form of Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC). We estimated that by 2030, business-as-usual GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in India would be 515 Megatonne CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) per year with a technical mitigation potential of 85.5 MtCO2e per year through adoption of various mitigation practices. About 80% of the technical mitigation potential could be achieved by adopting only cost-saving measures. Three mitigation options, i.e. efficient use of fertilizer, zero-tillage and rice-water management, could deliver more than 50% of the total technical abatement potential. © 2018 The Authors","Agriculture; Climate change; Greenhouse gas; India; Marginal Abatement Cost Curve; Mitigation","Agriculture; Cost effectiveness; Cultivation; Emission control; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Surveys; Water management; Adaptation to climate changes; Agricultural practices; Agricultural productions; Climate change mitigation; Cost effective opportunity; India; Marginal abatement cost curves; Mitigation; Climate change; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; abatement cost; agricultural production; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; mitigation; agriculture; animal husbandry; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; crop production; ecosystem restoration; environmental policy; food security; Gossypium; human; India; land use; livestock; no tillage; nonhuman; priority journal; rice; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; soil management; spatial analysis; sugarcane; water management; wheat; India",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057300469

Here, we explore incorporation of new dark food chains into human food systems, drawing inspiration from natural ecosystems, the history of single cell protein, and opportunities for new food production through wastewater treatment, microbial protein production, and aquaculture. The envisioned dark food chains rely upon chemoautotrophy in lieu of photosynthesis, with primary production based upon assimilation of CH 4 and CO 2 by methane- and hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria. The stoichiometry, kinetics, and thermodynamics of these bacteria are evaluated, and opportunities for recycling of carbon, nitrogen, and water are explored. Because these processes do not require light delivery, high volumetric productivities are possible; because they are exothermic, heat is available for downstream protein processing; because the feedstock gases are cheap, existing pipeline infrastructure could facilitate low-cost energy-efficient delivery in urban environments. Potential life-cycle benefits include: a protein alternative to fishmeal; partial decoupling of animal feed from human food; climate change mitigation due to decreased land use for agriculture; efficient local cycling of carbon and nutrients that offsets the need for energy-intensive fertilizers; and production of high value products, such as the prebiotic polyhydroxybutyrate. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Bacteria; Carbon; Climate change; Costs; Ecosystems; Energy efficiency; Land use; Proteins; Thermodynamics; Wastewater treatment; Water recycling; Climate change mitigation; Hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria; Innovative approaches; Pipeline infrastructure; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Resource limitations; Single cell proteins; Volumetric productivity; Life cycle; carbon; cell protein; hydrogen; methane; fertilizer; bacterium; chemoautotrophy; climate change; engineering; food chain; food production; photosynthesis; primary production; protein; agriculture; aquaculture; bacterium; biological mimicry; bioprocess; cave; chemoautotrophy; climate change; dark food chain; energy; food biotechnology; food chain; food industry; food processing; human; kinetics; lake; land use; nonhuman; photosynthesis; protein processing; recycling; Review; solubility; stoichiometry; thermodynamics; waste water management; water cycle; animal; ecosystem; Animalia; Agriculture; Animals; Ecosystem; Fertilizers; Food Chain; Humans; Methane",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062103162

To further understand these influences on MeHg levels in estuarine biota, we used a field study approach in sites across different temperature regions, and with varying organic carbon levels. In paired comparisons of sites with high vs. low organic carbon, fish had lower MeHg bioaccumulation factors (normalized to water concentrations) in high carbon sites, particularly subsites with large coastal wetlands and large variability in dissolved organic carbon levels in the water column. Across sites, MeHg level in the water column was strongly tied to dissolved organic carbon, and was the major driver of MeHg concentrations in fish and invertebrates.

Therefore, it is vital to consider the processes and impacts of soil degradation on society, especially on the provision of environmental goods and services, including food security and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Scientific societies devoted to soil science play significant roles in reducing soil degradation and promoting soil conservation by advancing scientific knowledge, education and environmental sustainability. The ESSC was founded on 4 November 1988, with the aims to: 1. Support research on soil degradation, soil protection and soil and water conservation. 2. Provide a network for the exchange of knowledge about soil degradation processes and soil conservation research and practises. 3. Produce publications on major issues relating to soil degradation and soil and water conservation. 4. Advise regulators and policy-makers on soil issues, especially soil degradation, protection and conservation. The societal challenges that can be addressed through better soil protection, advancing knowledge and scientific approaches to soil protection and sustainable management, mean the ESSC embraces the on-going development, application, review and constructive criticism of highly innovative scientific soil conservation methods. In this context, the ESSC analyses and publicizes the roles and functions of soil in natural and human-modified systems and the functional optimization of soils to ensure sustainable environmental protection. “The thin layer of soil that forms a patchy covering over the continents controls our own existence and that of every other animal of the land” (Rachel Carson (1962) in ‘Silent Spring’). © 2018 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water and Power Press","Soil degradation; Soil education; Soil functions; Soil health; Soil knowledge",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058179713

However, food production and millions of farm-based livelihoods in this region will continue to be adversely affected by hydro-climatic change and variation, reduced land productivity, and declining groundwater levels. Thus, agricultural adaptations are essential for protecting and improving upon intersecting goals of food security, poverty alleviation, and wellbeing. Household “capital” (e.g., natural, human, financial, physical, and social) is commonly cited as an indicator of livelihood adaptability and innovation. We develop a series of mediated structural equation models to empirically evaluate the validity of capital as a suitable indicator for adaptation and adaptive capacity. These models assess the extent to which household capital mediates the relationship between over 1,000 socio-economically differentiated and randomly selected farm households, and their crop, livestock, and land management adaptations in the states of Haryana and Bihar. Central to our models is a single household capital variable, constructed by aggregating nearly 80 different measurements of households' (i) physical/infrastructural capital, (ii) owned or accessed assets, (iii) livelihood diversity, (iv) ability to reach market or commercialize, (v) access to weather information, and (vi) social capital. We find household capital is a significant predictor in adopting crop, land management, and livestock-related adaptation strategies across both states. Second, and in certain cases, lower castes and less educated households engaged in fewer agricultural adaptations—an outcome mediated by their lower composition of capital. Further, and across almost all contexts, household capital mediated the effect of owning a greater proportion of land, and the higher uptake of agricultural adaptation activities. While improvements in any capital category can improve adoption, we recommend programs that improve (i) access to public and private agricultural infrastructure for lower castes; (ii) education and shared knowledge spaces for less-educated households; and (iii) the availability of low-interest loans and the more efficient legal transfer of land for agriculturalists owning a smaller proportion of their land. Through this novel and large-scale analysis of household data, we provide short-term and immediate recommendations for more equitable agricultural adaptation in this breadbasket region of northern India. © Copyright © 2019 Shah, Wagner, Sanga, Park, Demange, Gueiros and Niles.","adaptation; agriculture; climate change; household capital; India; socio-environmental change; structural equation modeling",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077638421

These “functional” molecules are represented by a wide variety of plant secondary metabolites, such as terpenoids, vitamins and polyphenols with antioxidant power. Widespread commercial crop varieties often contain scarce levels of functional molecules, because they have been mostly selected for productivity, rather than for the content of secondary metabolites. Different scenarios (global economic situation, foreseeable environmental changes) are pushing farmers to review the use of high yield crops and to focus on the valorization of locally-adapted plants. This renewed interest is strengthened by the growing need of consumers for functional foods with beneficial effects on human health and by the willingness to promote sustainable low-input agricultural practices exploiting local climate, soil, water, and (micro)biota. Here, we want to discuss a specific case study concerning locally-adapted crops in Tuscany (Italy). Analyses of nutraceutical molecules in locally-grown crop varieties (namely tomatoes, sweet cherries and onions) have shown that they are characterized by substantially higher functional molecule contents than commercial varieties. Our goal is to promote the high-throughput study of locally-adapted varieties to understand, in a medium-term perspective, whether the cultivation of such plants is a valuable support for the diet and an adequate local economic resource. Such plants can provide a boost to the regional economy, by diversifying the local crop-market landscape.

As it is understood today, the ecosystem approach emerged from the requirements of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)1 and its implementation has been intertwined with that of the CBD. The approach requires integration in the management of the environment and natural resources and eschews an approach which is purely sectoral. Wetlands provide an important lens through which to assess the application of the ecosystem approach to the management of coastal ecosystems. Together with forests, wetlands are the most important, yet most seriously threatened, ecosystems in the world.2 Indeed, the degradation and loss of wetlands is occurring more rapidly than that of forests or any other ecosystem.3 The reason could be that forests have always been viewed as a useful ecosystem, providing the source of trees and related products and serving important functions in society.4 In contrast, the utility of wetlands to society has not always been accepted or appreciated. Indeed, historically, wetlands were viewed as useless areas,5 the utility of which required their conversion to more productive uses such as agriculture. This resulted in wetlands being referred to in certain quarters as ‘wastelands’.6 Part of the reason why the importance of wetlands was not appreciated, and efforts spent only in their conversion to other uses, was the failure to accurately assess and value their economic utility. Decision-makers, developers and land-use planners have long perceived little economic benefit to be gained from conserving wetlands and few economic costs have been attached to their degradation.7 However, over time, the utility and importance of wetlands have been understood, and the international community has responded by making efforts for their conservation.8 Nevertheless, despite developments in the appreciation and valuation of the importance of wetlands and the need for their conservation, they still continue to be degraded and/or lost. Whilst certain pressures on wetlands arise from natural causes (such as droughts which affect community migration patterns), it is human activities that have significantly altered the rate and nature of wetlands change.9 Even today, the rate and scale of wetlands loss and/or degradation10 has continued to increase.11 Wetlands, however, are amongst the most precious natural resources on earth12 and the most productive and valuable ecosystems in the world.13 They have useful attributes and perform important functions for humanity. In terms of functions, wetlands play a key role in hydrological balance. They act as a storage of water supply and regulate the water table through the maintenance and recharge of surface and underground water, supply; discharge of groundwater, and storage of floodwaters in flood plains. Other functions include water purification, control of soil erosion and climate stability.14 Wetlands also serve as habitat for many species. They provide an important reservoir of genetic material and are also a source of rich cultural heritage. In Kenya, as elsewhere, wetlands support livelihoods both directly and indirectly through supporting necessary ecological functions, such as provision of water, waste water treatment, maintenance of hydrological cycles, and prevention of storm damage and erosion. In some places they also serve unique cultural functions. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment carried out between 2002 and 2005 remains the most comprehensive account to date of the state of the world’s ecosystems and the required strategies for their conservation and sustainable use.15 The report is famous for the linkages it demonstrated between ecosystems and human well-being through what it called ecosystem services, which it categorised into provisioning services, regulating services, social services and supporting services.16 Several thematic reports were also prepared in association with the Assessment, one of which focused on marine and coastal ecosystems.17 That report18 highlighted the importance of marine and coastal ecosystems, stating that the services they provide include supply of food, fuel wood, energy resources, natural products, and bioprospecting, shoreline stabilization, flood prevention, storm protection, climate regulation, hydrological services, nutrient regulation, carbon sequestration, detoxification of polluted waters, waste disposal, culture, tourism, and recreation, habitat provision, nutrient cycling, primary productivity, and soil formation.19 Governance of oceans and coasts is best understood as the process for policy making by competent institutions in a system of negotiation between nested governmental institutions at several levels (international, national, regional and local), on the one hand, and market parties and civil society organizations on the other.20 Only an integrated approach can help resolve the governance challenges of the oceans and the coast which: for the most part, have been related to the intensifying nature of human interactions with the oceans and coasts and the inability of governance institutions to adapt. Governance processes have in the past primarily focused on regulating individual sectors, ignoring interactions between sectors and ocean ecosystems. While governance effectiveness varies, based on institutional architecture, often specific to a given place, sociopolitical context, legal and policy regime, ignoring interactions among sectors and their combined impacts on the coastal and marine ecosystems, has placed at risk the heritage, livelihoods, and cultures of coastal communities that rely on healthy marine environments.21 In 2010 Kenya adopted a new Constitutional architecture that places a premium on sustainable development as a key governance imperative and requires public participation in all processes. Based on this development, the present chapter assesses the extent to which Kenya’s legal framework for management of wetlands in the coastal region adopts the ecosystem approach and whether it enhances the conservation and wise use of wetlands and thus aligns to the constitutional dictates of sustainable development. The main argument that the paper advances is that both in law and practice, the move towards ecosystem approach is slow and fledgling. The management approach is still characterised by sector specific focus, governance overlaps and legal gaps. However, the adoption of a ‘green constitution’22 and the incorporation of the ecosystem approach in the National Environment Policy in 2014 provide a basis for sustainable management of wetlands in the Kenyan coast. © Collins Odote, 2019",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128516293

The diversity of halophytes in such conditions offered a huge genetic pool together with wide options for recultivating such saline areas. The variety of halophytic plants also put forward the promising microorganisms associated with such plants helping in ameliorating the stress through various mechanisms, viz., antioxidant and other stress-related exudates production, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase release, chelating agents production, and expression of stress-related genes along with widely understood enhancement of the plant growth through a multitude of processes. Such organisms including bacteria, fungi, and arbuscular mycorrhiza, epiphytic or endophytic, have been reported to enhance the phytoremediation potential of halophytes. Keeping in view the potential of halophytes and associated microbiome, this chapter will focus on genetic and agronomic potential of halophytes and role of allied microorganisms in enhancing the salinity tolerance and assisted phytoremediation of saline soils. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Halophytes; Mycorrhiza; Plant growth-promoting bacteria; Plant growth-promoting fungi; Saline soils; Salt marshes",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083538108

However, water infrastructure and management in the United States are largely optimized for historic conditions—designed and operated to respond to social needs, and past mean and extreme streamflow, which may no longer apply in the future. Temperature, precipitation, ecosystem dynamics, energy and food production, and social systems are all experiencing changes, which cumulatively affect the security of water supply. Here, we examine the impact of these changes in a provisioning basin in the arid Southwest, the San Juan River, which supplies water, food, and energy to the Colorado River and the Rio Grande. Our analysis applies a multi-model framework to examine future climate and water use scenarios. Results demonstrate that the San Juan River basin could experience significant disruptions to water deliveries (−12% to −48% for the drier models) and shortages that exceed manageable thresholds (53% to 73% of water in shorted years), potentially affecting both the local basin as well as other regions that receive water and energy from the San Juan. While water stress metrics vary across the scenarios, results indicate the need for government, industry, and communities to consider options for adapting to water supply shifts. These results raise important questions regarding the resilience of water resources in basins across the West under future scenarios and implications for energy, food, and other water supply needs. © 2019 The Author(s).

This interest is primarily driven by the interrelated implications that FLW has with food security, human health, economic development, and ecosystems. The staggering amount of FLW currently generated along supply chains exacerbates global food system challenges, such as world population growth, change of dietary habits, energy intensity of agro-food systems, and food supply vulnerability due to climate change. In a life-cycle perspective, beyond representing a missed opportunity to feed the growing world population, FLW also puts a huge pressure on natural capital, in terms of natural resources consumption (e.g., fossil energy, water, fish stocks, agricultural land), environmental pollution (water, air, soil), GHG emissions, ecosystem resilience, and biodiversity loss. This chapter aims at analyzing food systems sustainability through the lens of the interrelated implications and impacts of FLW on production and consumption. First, it provides an overview of the debate around FLW definition and quantification. Then, it focuses on the causes and impacts of FLW and the related methodological challenges.

The site constitutes one of the largest ice-free areas within the Antarctic Peninsula region. Since it has a high level of environmental protection, it is less human-impacted compared to other sites within the South Shetland archipelago. The main investigations in Byers Peninsula focused on the physical and chemical limnology of the lakes, ponds, rivers, and wetlands, as well as on the structure of their planktonic and benthic microbial communities, and on the functional ecology of the microbial food webs. Lakes and ponds in Byers range along a productivity gradient that extends from the less productive lakes located upland to the eutrophic coastal lakes. Their planktonic assemblages include viruses, bacteria, a metabolically diverse community of protists (i.e., autotrophs, heterotrophs, and mixotrophs), and a few metazooplankton species. Most of the studies conducted in the site demonstrate the strong influence of the physical environment (i.e., temperature, availability of light, and water) and nutrient availability in structuring these microbial communities. However, top-down biotic processes may occur in summer, when predation by zooplankton can exert a strong influence on the abundance of protists, including flagellates and ciliated protozoa. As a consequence, bacterioplankton could be partly released from the grazing pressure exerted by these protists, and proliferates fueled by external nutrient subsidies from the lake's catchment. As summer temperatures in this region are slightly above the melting point of water, biotic processes, such as those related to the productivity of lakes during ice-free periods, could become even more relevant as warming induced by climate change progresses. The limnological research carried out at the site proves that Byers Peninsula deserves special attention in the framework of the research in extreme environments. Together with nearby sites, such as Signy Island, Byers Peninsula comprises a featuring element of the Maritime Antarctic region that represents a benchmark area relative to the global distribution and diversity of aquatic microorganisms. © 2016 by the authors.","Bacterioplankton; Byers Peninsula; Maritime Antarctica; Microbial mats; Next-generation sequencing; Protists; Virioplankton","aquatic environment; bacterioplankton; biodiversity; environmental protection; hot spot; limnology; microbial community; microbial ecology; microbial mat; protist; Antarctica; Antarctica; Byers Peninsula; Livingston Island; South Shetland Islands; Bacteria (microorganisms); Mastigophora (flagellates); Myxozoa; Protista",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074391792

In recent years, it has received extensive attention from the United Nations (UN), the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and so on. However, existing land degradation studies still suffer by unclear concepts, ambiguous processes and mechanisms, and incomplete understanding of impacts. Thus, clarifying the process and mechanism of land degradation is the key to preventing further land degradation and restoring degraded land. Based on the thematic assessment of the IPBES, the present study reviewed the concept, process, mechanisms as well as impacts of land degradation. The process of land degradation is driven by two factors: the natural environment and anthropogenic activities. In land degradation process, there are six land degradation states; namely, the appearance of degradation, degraded in the past, susceptible to degradation, land recovers when stressors are removed, temporal trend of increase in degradation, and stable degraded state. Land degradation can be divided into urban land degradation, cropland degradation, forest and grassland degradation, wetland degradation, and other types of land degradation based on land use types. Land degradation can threaten food and water security, reduce biodiversity and ecosystem services, trigger regional conflicts, mass migration, and disease transmission, exacerbate poverty and global climate change. The review of the land degradation process, mechanism, and impacts will provide theoretical guidance for in-depth study of land degradation, such as desertification and rocky desertification in China, and provide decision support for overall planning of governance of the mountain, water, forest, cropland, lake, and grass systems, supporting the construction of a Beautiful China and Eco-civilization. © 2019 Science Press.

On account of climate changes and the quest for food security, they are an effective way of solving key problems in the agrarian sector. Nowadays nanotechnologies are widely used for creating nanofertilizers, nanoinsecticides, nanofungicides, nanoherbicides and other nanopreparations. Numerous researches affirm advantages of nanopreparations, which has helped them find a wide use in agricultural practice. At the same time, nanopreparations are the source of entry into the environment of nanoparticles (size less than 100 nm) which are characterized by large active surface and specific physical-chemical properties different from ordinary chemical substances. It is precisely this which determines their bioaccessibility, bioaccumulation and toxicity. Recently, data about toxicity of nanoparticles for human and natural ecosystems have been accumulated. The results of a great deal of research affirm that they break the processes of photosynthesis, transpiration, mitosis, miosis and have a negative influence on colouring agents, proteins and carbohydrates. Under their action, physiological processes of plant growth and development are disturbed, which take place mainly in root system. Nanoparticles are characterized by high bioaccessibility for soil organisms, they are toxic to earthworms and microorganisms and they influence circulation of carbon and nitrogen. Aquatic organisms have been shown to have high sensitivity to nanoparticles; toxic effect has been registered for fish, daphnids, water plants and microorganisms. Taking into consideration the high level of potential danger of nanopreparations used in crop cultivation, special notice should be paid to the development of eco toxicological research. At present, nanoecotoxicological approaches to assessment of the danger of nanomaterials and nanoparticles are absent. Development of reports on elaboration of quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis, and methods of modeling and prognostication of risks is only at the initial stage. The objective of this review is attracting attention to solving the problem of nanoecotoxicology, nanoagrochemicals and nanopesticides, which needs consolidated efforts of scientists, governmental organizations and business and is an obligatory condition for preventing the negative impact of nanomaterials on humans and the environment. © 2019 Oles Honchar Dnipro National University.

The loss of the mountain cryosphere due to global warming is already evident in many parts of the world and has direct implications to people living in mountain areas and indirect implications to those who live downstream of glaciated river basins. Despite the growing concerns, the relationship between cryosphere change and human society has yet to be assessed systematically. A better understanding of how cryosphere change affects human systems and human security would provide much needed support to the planning of global and regional actions to mitigate impacts and facilitate adaptation. This paper synthesizes the current evidence for and potential impacts of cryosphere change on water, energy, food, and the environment in different mountain regions in the world. The analysis reveals that the changes in the cryosphere and the associated environmental change have already impacted people living in high mountain areas and are likely to introduce new challenges for water, energy, and food security and to exacerbate ecosystem and environmental degradation in the future. The effects of cryospheric changes are also likely to extend to downstream river basins where glacier melt contributes significantly to dry season river flows and supports irrigation, fisheries, and navigation, as well as water supply to many big cities.

These occurrences have led to an obvious decrease in waterbird species and overall population size. Periodic and timely monitoring of changes in habitat suitability and understanding the potential driving factors for waterbirds are essential for maintaining regional ecological security. In this study, land cover changes from 2000 to 2015 in this eco-sensitive plain were examined using Landsat images and an object-based classification method. Four groups of environmental factors, including human disturbance, water situation, food availability, and shelter safety, characterized by remote sensing data were selected to develop a habitat suitability index (HSI) for assessing habitat suitability for waterbirds. HSI was further classified into four grades (optimum, good, general, and poor), and their spatiotemporal patterns were documented from 2000 to 2015. Our results revealed that cropland expansion and wetland shrinkage were the dominant land cover changes. Waterbird habitat areas in the optimum grade experienced a sharp decline by 7195 km2. The habitat area in good suitability experienced reduction at a change rate of -8.64%, from38,672 km2 to 35,331 km2. In addition, waterbird habitats in the general and poor grades increased overall by 10.31%. More specifically, the total habitat areas with optimum suitable grade, in five national nature reserves over the study region, decreased by 12.21%, while habitat areas with poor suitable grade increased by 3.89%. Changes in habitat suitability could be largely attributed to the increase in human disturbance, including agricultural cultivation from wetlands and grasslands and the expansion of built-up lands. Our findings indicate that additional attention should be directed towards reducing human impact on habitat suitability for sustainable ecosystems. © 2019 by the authors.","Habitat suitability for waterbirds; Land cover change; Remote sensing; TheWest Songnen Plain of China","anthropogenic effect; climate change; cultivation; ecological impact; ecosystem management; environmental factor; grassland; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; habitat structure; image classification; land cover; Landsat; nature reserve; observational method; population size; remote sensing; satellite imagery; waterfowl; wetland; China; Songnen Plain",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063465854

The ways in which stratospheric ozone depletion is directly altering climate in the southern hemisphere and the consequent extensive effects on aquatic ecosystems are also addressed. The primary objective is to synthesise novel findings over the past four years in the context of the existing understanding of ecosystem response to UV radiation and the interactive effects of climate change. If it were not for the Montreal Protocol, stratospheric ozone depletion would have led to high levels of exposure to solar UV radiation with much stronger negative effects on all trophic levels in aquatic ecosystems than currently experienced in both inland and oceanic waters. This “world avoided” scenario that has curtailed ozone depletion, means that climate change and other environmental variables will play the primary role in regulating the exposure of aquatic organisms to solar UV radiation. Reductions in the thickness and duration of snow and ice cover are increasing the levels of exposure of aquatic organisms to UV radiation. Climate change was also expected to increase exposure by causing shallow mixed layers, but new data show deepening in some regions and shoaling in others. In contrast, climate-change related increases in heavy precipitation and melting of glaciers and permafrost are increasing the concentration and colour of UV-absorbing dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulates. This is leading to the “browning” of many inland and coastal waters, with consequent loss of the valuable ecosystem service in which solar UV radiation disinfects surface waters of parasites and pathogens. Many organisms can reduce damage due to exposure to UV radiation through behavioural avoidance, photoprotection, and photoenzymatic repair, but meta-analyses continue to confirm negative effects of UV radiation across all trophic levels. Modeling studies estimating photoinhibition of primary production in parts of the Pacific Ocean have demonstrated that the UV radiation component of sunlight leads to a 20% decrease in estimates of primary productivity. Exposure to UV radiation can also lead to positive effects on some organisms by damaging less UV-tolerant predators, competitors, and pathogens. UV radiation also contributes to the formation of microplastic pollutants and interacts with artificial sunscreens and other pollutants with adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. Exposure to UV-B radiation can decrease the toxicity of some pollutants such as methyl mercury (due to its role in demethylation) but increase the toxicity of other pollutants such as some pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Feeding on microplastics by zooplankton can lead to bioaccumulation in fish. Microplastics are found in up to 20% of fish marketed for human consumption, potentially threatening food security. Depletion of stratospheric ozone has altered climate in the southern hemisphere in ways that have increased oceanic productivity and consequently the growth, survival and reproduction of many sea birds and mammals. In contrast, warmer sea surface temperatures related to these climate shifts are also correlated with declines in both kelp beds in Tasmania and corals in Brazil. This assessment demonstrates that knowledge of the interactive effects of ozone depletion, UV radiation, and climate change factors on aquatic ecosystems has advanced considerably over the past four years and confirms the importance of considering synergies between environmental factors. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.",,"fresh water; adaptation; analysis; animal; aquaculture; aquatic species; chemistry; climate change; ecosystem; fish; ice cover; ozone depletion; ozone layer; photosynthesis; physiology; pollution; radiation response; sea; ultraviolet radiation; zooplankton; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Aquaculture; Aquatic Organisms; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollution; Fishes; Fresh Water; Ice Cover; Oceans and Seas; Ozone Depletion; Photosynthesis; Stratospheric Ozone; Ultraviolet Rays; Zooplankton",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062863144

Understanding how biogeochemical transformation and erosion-induced SOC redistribution influence SOC profiles and stocks is critical to our food security and adaptation to climate change. The important roles of erosion and deposition on SOC dynamics have drawn increasing attention in the past decades, but quantifying such dynamics is still challenging. Here we develop a process-based quasi 3-D model that couples surface runoff, soil moisture dynamics, biogeochemical transformation, and landscape evolution. We apply this model to a subcatchment in Iowa to understand how natural forcing and farming practices affect the SOC dynamics in the critical zone. The net soil thickness and SOC stock change rates are −0.336 (mm/yr) and −1.9 (g C/m 2 /year), respectively. Our model shows that in a fast transport landscape, SOC transport is the dominant control on SOC dynamics compared to biogeochemical transformation. The SOC profiles have “noses” below the surface at depositional sites, which are consistent with cores sampled at the same site. Generally, erosional sites are local net atmospheric carbon sinks and vice versa for depositional sites, but exceptions exist as seen in the simulation results. Furthermore, the mechanical soil mixing arising from tillage enhances SOC stock at erosional sites and reduces it at depositional ones. This study not only helps us understand the evolution of SOC stock and profiles in a watershed but can also serve as an instrument to develop practical means for protecting carbon loss due to human activities. ©2018.

This work provides proof-of-concept of the use of high-resolution images to detect malaria vector breeding sites in Amazonian Peru and such innovative methodology could be crucial for LSM malaria integrated interventions. © 2019 Carrasco-Escobar et al.",,"accuracy; algorithm; Anopheles darlingi; Article; breeding; climate change; clinical article; cohort analysis; community care; comparative study; controlled study; disease transmission; drone; drought; environmental protection; female; food security; geographic mapping; habitat; health care survey; human; intervention study; larval development; malaria; malaria falciparum; male; microorganism detection; microscopy; mosquito control; nonhuman; normalized difference vegetation index; performance; Plasmodium vivax malaria; predictive value; scoring system; sensitivity analysis; sensitivity and specificity; spatial autocorrelation analysis; training; validation process; water management; animal; Anopheles; ecosystem; fluorescence imaging; growth, development and aging; image processing; mosquito vector; Peru; procedures; proof of concept; zoology; Animals; Anopheles; Ecosystem; Entomology; Female; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Mosquito Vectors; Optical Imaging; Peru; Proof of Concept Study",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060937775

Their predicted increase in recurrence and intensity poses serious threats to future food security. Still today, the knowledge of how droughts and heatwaves start and evolve remains limited, and so does our understanding of how climate change may affect them. Droughts and heatwaves have been suggested to intensify and propagate via land–atmosphere feedbacks. However, a global capacity to observe these processes is still lacking, and climate and forecast models are immature when it comes to representing the influences of land on temperature and rainfall. Key open questions remain in our goal to uncover the real importance of these feedbacks: What is the impact of the extreme meteorological conditions on ecosystem evaporation? How do these anomalies regulate the atmospheric boundary layer state (event self-intensification) and contribute to the inflow of heat and moisture to other regions (event self-propagation)? Can this knowledge on the role of land feedbacks, when available, be exploited to develop geo-engineering mitigation strategies that prevent these events from aggravating during their early stages? The goal of our perspective is not to present a convincing answer to these questions, but to assess the scientific progress to date, while highlighting new and innovative avenues to keep advancing our understanding in the future. © 2018 The Authors.

Comparing aerial or satellite images from the same region recorded at different times, known as post-classification comparison, is an approach that aims to identify changes in land coverage and understand forest spatial pattern change over time. These patterns are extremely complex, therefore, for their description and understanding a better approach would be multifractal geometry. In this paper, by using the multifractal analysis the evolution of the forest spatial model in southern Moldova over a decade has been investigated. We explored the potential of aerial image processing, lacunarity and textural analysis to detect a correlation between lacunarity, fractal dimensions and coverage crowns areas. This analysis leads to the determination of the percentage of land coverage, the dynamics of the natural reforestation process, the location of mature trees and the determination of areas where the landscape has changed drastically due to deforestation and / or reforestation. Two opposite forest spatial patterns were identified. For four studied forests, the rate of deforestation was continuously increased between 2005 and 2010. For only one forest, the Valeni forest, the coverage crown area has increased over the analyzed time period. © 2019 Carpathian Journal of Earth and Environmental Sciences.","Deforestation; Forest landscape change; Fractal analysis; Multifractal; Multifractal spectra","aerial survey; deforestation; forest cover; fractal analysis; image processing; landscape change; reforestation; satellite imagery; Moldova",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059888332

Improving the nutritional health of a population is a long-term goal that requires ensuring the long-term sustainability of the food system. Current environmental trends, including those related to climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation, water shortages, and water pollution, threaten long-term food security and are caused in part by current diets and agricultural practices. Addressing these problems while producing more food for a growing population will require changes to current food systems. Dietary choices have a significant role in contributing to environmental impacts, which could be lessened by consuming fewer overconsumed animal products and more plant-based foods while reducing excess energy intake and the amount of food wasted. Discussion of sustainability within governmental dietary guidance is common in many countries, is consistent with previous US guidelines, and is within the scope of authorizing legislation. Dietary choices are a personal matter, but many American consumers are motivated by a concern for the environment and would welcome sound advice from credentialed nutrition professionals. More opportunities are needed for developing such interdisciplinary knowledge among nutritionists. © 2018 The Authors","agriculture; climate change; dietary choice; dietary guidance; environment","agriculture; catering service; climate change; diet; environment; health education; human; medical society; nutrition policy; nutritional science; organization and management; Agriculture; Climate Change; Diet; Environment; Food Supply; Health Education; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Nutritional Sciences; Societies, Medical",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054756316

The pixel-based classification was adopted and combined with the extended change matrix quantity and intensity analysis using 32-year (1985–2017) Landsat data and land use information from land owners and farmers. Results indicate an active forest loss (19.5%) with dormant gain (0.8%).

Climate change has often been described as ""one of the most pressing environmental challenges"". It is a growing global problem and concern, calling for concerted efforts by the developed as well as developing countries. Climate change scenarios include higher temperatures, changes in precipitation, and higher atmospheric CO, concentrations which may affect on yield (both quality and quantity), growth rates, photosynthesis and transpiration rates, moisture availability, through changes of water use (irrigation) and agricultural inputs such as herbicides, insecticides and fertilizers etc. Environmental effects such as frequency and Intensity of soil drainage (leading to nitrogen leaching), soil erosion, land availability, reduction of crop diversity may also affect agricultural productivity.

We present longitudinal evidence on household food insecurity and child diets by drawing on a mixed methods study with two cohorts of children from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (India). Analysis of survey data shows that children living in food insecure households had lower dietary diversity and probability of consumption of micronutrient- and protein-rich foods, which are critical for their healthy development. Inequalities in child dietary quality by household food security status were most pronounced at preschool age. Children identified dietary quality as a critical dimension of their well-being. From an early age, children were able to describe and explain the food security challenges of their families and recognize the negative consequences of household food insecurity on their diets, health and education. Children were not only cognizant of household responses to food insecurity, but they were also actively involved in such strategies through limiting the quantity and quality of food purchased and consumed, reducing dietary diversity, and/or engaging in work or social protection. The latter were often mentioned as critical safety nets in face of economic, demographic or climate shocks, although children expressed criticism about implementation. Longitudinal mixed methods can enhance our understanding of children's experiences of household food insecurity and its repercussion on their health and broader well-being.

A number of simultaneous socio-environmental perturbations are affecting Patagonia (41-55°S), a vast and complex ecosystem whose economic and societal well-being depends on coastal resources (~80% of people live near-shore; the coastal economy provides > 40,000 jobs). In this new scenario, overlapping natural variability (interannual - seasonal dynamics) and human-induced environmental changes (global change) are major drivers influencing the marine food web structure and functions. Evidence of large environmental changes has been detected in the Patagonia marine system through (a) regional-scale, climatic-oceanographic coupled anomalous events, (b) interannual hydrological changes (decreasing pattern) in freshwater river inputs (watersheds into fjords), and (c) more frequent coastal and oceanic microbial outbreaks (Harmful Algal Blooms). Those changes have highly uncertain effects for the basic functionalities, structure, and feedback responses of coastal systems and their coupling with hydrological (e.g., river streamflow) or biogeochemical (e.g., biological carbon pump) processes. The northern Patagonian fjords system is hypothesized to act as an indicator of large-scale climate change given strong environmental variability. This, combined with regional climatic-oceanographic events (e.g., El Niño Southern Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode) and effects of local anthropogenic activities (e.g., nutrient fluxes from extensive aquaculture, land change due to forestry) may impact the chemical and physical properties of the surface water, destabilizing biological productivity and chemical coastal processes.

Water security exists when all people have physical and economical access to sufficient, safe, and clean water that meets basic needs. However, water security is threatened by growing human population, episodic environmental disasters, indiscriminate land management practices, contaminants, and escalation in geopolitical conflicts. <3% of the estimated 1.4 billion cubic kilometers of water on earth is available for consumption. Although there exist a range of laboratory and field methods for measuring the chemical, physical and biological properties of water, the information available to the public remains inconsistent and patchy. To this end, we advance a new theory of a single-value objective water quality index (WQI) that considers the interaction between the above properties, to provide concise information for source water quality surveillance and monitoring. Although geospatial technologies such as remote sensing is credited as a high frequency spatiotemporal mapping tool, exiguous information is available on its application for constructing single-value WQIs. Besides, no remote sensing device exists that directly measures water quality, which must indirectly be inferred through modeling sensed remote sensing signals with measured water properties. This review not only highlights the water security conundrum but also provides an overview of methods for integrating geolocated qualitative (e.g., management data) with quantitative (i.e., measured water constituent properties) into a WQI. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Fresh water; Indicator; Water quality; Water security","Indicators (instruments); Water quality; Biological properties; Environmental disasters; Fresh Water; Geo-spatial informations; Land management practices; Source water qualities; Water quality indicators; Water security; Remote sensing; freshwater; mapping method; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; standardization; water quality; acidity; alkalinity; aquatic environment; artificial neural network; atmospheric deposition; climate change; ecosystem restoration; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; evapotranspiration; fluorometry; geology; land use; physical chemistry; principal component analysis; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; rating scale; remote sensing; Review; riparian ecosystem; socioeconomics; support vector machine; topography; vegetation; water analysis; water quality; water quality index; water temperature; geographic information system; procedures; standards; water quality; water supply; Environmental Monitoring; Geographic Information Systems; Water Quality; Water Supply",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049319764

In Bangladesh, coastal and delta communities rely on these systems for a livelihood, and the sustainability of the productivity is seriously threatened by both climate change and unsustainable management. These multiple drivers of change shape the livelihood dependence and adaptation responses, where a better understanding is needed to achieve sustainable management in these systems, while maintaining and improving dependent livelihoods. This need has been addressed in this study in the region of Satkhira, in the southwest coast of Bangladesh, where livelihoods are highly dependent on aquatic systems for food supply and income. Traditional wild fish harvest in the rivers and aquaculture systems, including ghers, ponds, and crab points have been changing in terms of the uses and intensity of management, and suffering from climate change impacts as well. By means of six focus groups with 50 participants total, and validated by expert consultations, we conduct an analysis to understand the main perceived impacts from climate and human activities; and the adaptation responses from the aquatic system livelihoods. We find that biodiversity has decreased drastically, while farmed species have increased and shrimp gher farming turned more intensive becoming the main source of income. All these changes have important implications for food supply in the region and environmental sustainability. Dramatic responses taken in the communities include exit the fisheries and migration, and more adaptive responses include species diversification, crab fattening and working more on the pond and gher infrastructure. This study evidences the results of the combination of multiple stressors in productive systems and the barriers to adaptation in aquatic ecosystem dependent communities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Aquaculture; Bangladesh; Coastal ecosystems; Focus group discussions; Gender inequality","Aquaculture; Aquatic ecosystems; Biodiversity; Food supply; Lakes; Shellfish; Sustainable development; Adaptation; Bangladesh; Coastal ecosystems; Focus groups; Gender inequality; Climate change; adaptive management; aquaculture; coastal zone; community response; environmental change; environmental impact; gender disparity; livelihood; sustainability; adaptation; aquatic environment; Article; Bangladesh; biodiversity; catering service; coastal waters; crab; environmental change; environmental protection; female; fishery; human; human impact (environment); hurricane; male; nonhuman; pisciculture; pond; population migration; poverty; priority journal; river; sex factor; shrimp; animal; Bangladesh; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; statistics and numerical data; Bangladesh; Khulna [Bangladesh]; Satkhira; Decapoda (Crustacea); Animals; Bangladesh; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Humans",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046755360

This paper presents and applies an analytical framework for soil governance. Governance performance is assessed with the following dimensions: capacity to support resilience, effectiveness, efficiency, and legitimacy (REEL). We also specify each dimension in more detail by using indicators to enable an assessment of each criterion. These core indicators need to be analysed on different spatial and temporal scales. The development of the framework was based on a review of existing literature on environmental and natural resource governance. It is built upon existing frameworks and focuses specifically on a systematic description and evaluation of instruments.

Even though surface water is abundant, Lao PDR is still vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate variability and climate change - flooding and heavy monsoon rains are common but the country also experiences long and prolonged dry seasons with pronounced and common water scarcity. Shortages, both spatially and temporally are increasingly being met with supplies from groundwater. As groundwater management is still at a very basic level and perhaps the single most important constraint to progress, the goal of our SEG-Geoscientists without Borders project is to build human and institutional capacity in-country and resilience in agricultural productivity through sustainable use of groundwater for local farmers on the Vientiane Plain, Lao PDR. The project is a collaboration with a number of Lao project partners, made up primarily of stakeholders from government, university, private-sector representatives and the local communities. This collaboration is intended to build and strengthen capacity of our Lao partners through the application and use of hydrogeophysical techniques to identify and characterize the groundwater aquifer systems along a transect on the Vientiane Plain. The project has provided local undergraduate and postgraduate training opportunities for a number of students by introducing and training students in the use of a number of different geophysical techniques, including frequency and time domain electromagnetic induction (FDEM and TDEM), electrical resistivity, ground penetrating radar (GPR), borehole geophysical logging (NMR), and hydrogeological field assessment skills. Specifically, we aimed in this project to: (1) train students and staff of the National University of Laos and staff of the Department of Water Resources (DWR), Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Lao PDR in the use of near-surface geophysics, as well as the collection and use of complementary hydrogeophysical data sets; (2) involve local community members in raising awareness of proper groundwater management and water use for increasing sustainable food production by providing training and water quality field kits for long-term deployment in the community; (3) improve groundwater management by scientific understanding of the hydrogeological system underlying the Vientiane Plain including detailed water quality analysis of the groundwater to ensure that it meets water quality guidelines for the intended use; and (5) validate and 'ground-truth' the new geophysical data sets with the collection of hydrogeological and hydrochemistry data and water balance modelling; all information needed to improve the chances of making informed water management decisions. This project will contribute to the development of reliable hydrogeological maps that can be used to improve the prospects for securing good supplies and delineate good and poor quality water to lower the risk of well failure and groundwater contamination on the Vientiane Plain. It will assist local community members, farmers and government to expand groundwater development for agricultural production and strengthen the resilience of agriculture to climatic uncertainties. The scientific information has the potential to benefit rural livelihood enhancement through the sustainable use of groundwater and ensure that groundwater use for other purposes including domestic and drinking supplies, as well as for ecosystem services are not compromised. The study will add considerable scientific weight to ensuring that groundwater in Lao PDR provides a reliable, safe and secure resource into the future. We recently completed a large training/data collection campaign over the field area in the Vientiane Basin.

The productivity of food, feed, fiber, and biofuel is ought to be paralleled with global population that is expected to reach nine billion before the middle of twenty-first century. Among the nutrient management system, the foliar feeding provides a potential prospective option to meet the diversity of site- and crop-specific conditions, irrigation water supplies, eco-edaphic factors and farm management, and also concurrent economic and environmental prospective. Taking trade-off into account, the foliar feeding of essential nutrients will accrue in mitigating the negative effects of abiotic stresses, with concurrent maximizing productivity. This technique is cost-effective and beneficial under stressful conditions. The plants well-fed with essential nutrients have greater tolerance capacity in response to abiotic stresses. Thereby foliar feeding of nutrients is also referred as climate-smart agriculture. The response of foliar feeding varies greatly due to crop species, growth stages, concentration of added nutrient solution, and the relative water content in the plant parts.

Monsoon environments constitute a different set of parameters for landscape interactions because of seasonal episodes of water abundance. In this paper, we evaluate the microscale management of routine and anticipated high-water events for the ancient Indian subcontinent, where people used the monsoon cycle to engage in rice farming that in turn supported the growth of cities. Rice production would have encompassed two fluctuating inputs: rural labor, which may have become scarce when villagers left farmlands to become city dwellers; and water, the quantity of which varies dramatically on both a seasonal basis because of the monsoon and on an occasional basis because of tropical cyclones. The abundance of water (even with its risks of overabundance) encompassed numerous logistical challenges but also permitted high productivity within short distances of urban centers. The case study of the ancient city of Sisupalgarh in eastern India illustrates that high levels of productivity per land area enabled city residents to engage in short-distance economies for food production, while maintaining regional contacts through durable-goods trade to mitigate occasional episodes of crop failure in times of major flooding. © The Author(s) 2018.","archaeology; flooding; rice; urbanism; water","archaeology; climate change; crop production; drought; flooding; monsoon; nature-society relations; rice; tropical cyclone; urban growth; urbanization; water; water management; India",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051091436

To date, however, global assessments of how to increase crop yield have failed to consider the negative effects of tropospheric ozone, a gaseous pollutant that enters the leaf stomatal pores of plants along with carbon dioxide, and is increasing in concentration globally, particularly in rapidly developing countries. Earlier studies have simply estimated that the largest effects are in the areas with the highest ozone concentrations. Using a modelling method that accounts for the effects of soil moisture deficit and meteorological factors on the stomatal uptake of ozone, we show for the first time that ozone impacts on wheat yield are particularly large in humid rain-fed and irrigated areas of major wheat-producing countries (e.g. United States, France, India, China and Russia). Averaged over 2010–2012, we estimate that ozone reduces wheat yields by a mean 9.9% in the northern hemisphere and 6.2% in the southern hemisphere, corresponding to some 85 Tg (million tonnes) of lost grain. Total production losses in developing countries receiving Official Development Assistance are 50% higher than those in developed countries, potentially reducing the possibility of achieving UN SDG2. Crucially, our analysis shows that ozone could reduce the potential yield benefits of increasing irrigation usage in response to climate change because added irrigation increases the uptake and subsequent negative effects of the pollutant. We show that mitigation of air pollution in a changing climate could play a vital role in achieving the above-mentioned UN SDG, while also contributing to other SDGs related to human health and well-being, ecosystems and climate change. © 2018 The Authors.

Top research priorities were identified through a broad solicitation of candidate research questions (180 were received). A group of experts across sectors and disciplines gathered for a workshop to categorize, prioritize, and filter the candidate questions, identify missing topics, and rewrite questions. Participants then collectively chose the 40 most important questions. This cross-sectoral effort ensured the inclusion of a diversity of topics and questions (e.g., coastal hazards, agricultural production, ecosystem functioning, urban infrastructure, and human health) likely to be important to Georgia policy-makers, practitioners, and scientists.

Rising temperatures, hydrological intensification, changes in atmospheric acid deposition and associated acidification recovery, and changes in vegetative cover are resulting in fundamental changes in terrestrial–aquatic biogeochemical linkages. The effects of global change are readily observed in alterations in the supply of dissolved organic matter (DOM)—the messenger between terrestrial and lake ecosystems—with potentially profound effects on the structure and function of lakes. Northern terrestrial ecosystems contain substantial stores of organic matter and filter or funnel DOM, affecting the timing and magnitude of DOM delivery to surface waters. This terrestrial DOM is processed in streams, rivers, and lakes, ultimately shifting its composition, stoichiometry, and bioavailability. Here, we explore the potential consequences of these global change-driven effects for lake food webs at northern latitudes. Notably, we provide evidence that increased allochthonous DOM supply to lakes is overwhelming increased autochthonous DOM supply that potentially results from earlier ice-out and a longer growing season. Furthermore, we assess the potential implications of this shift for the nutritional quality of autotrophs in terms of their stoichiometry, fatty acid composition, toxin production, and methylmercury concentration, and therefore, contaminant transfer through the food web. We conclude that global change in northern regions leads not only to reduced primary productivity but also to nutritionally poorer lake food webs, with discernible consequences for the trophic web to fish and humans. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","atmospheric change; cyanobacteria; dissolved organic matter; food webs; lake; mercury; northern","cyanobacterium; dissolved organic matter; ecosystem response; food web; global change; lake ecosystem; mercury (element); terrestrial ecosystem; Cyanobacteria; animal; chemistry; climate change; fish; food chain; lake; river; season; Animals; Climate Change; Fishes; Food Chain; Lakes; Rivers; Seasons",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045844439

By 2050 the global demand for animal products is projected to increase by 60% to 70%, and developing countries will have a lion's share in this increase. Currently, ~800 million tonnes of cereals (one-third of total cereal production) are used in animal feed and by 2050 it is projected to be over 1.1 billion tonnes. Most of the increase in feed demand will be in developing countries, which already face many food security challenges. Additional feed required for the projected increased demand of animal products, if met through food grains, will further exacerbate the food insecurity in these countries. Furthermore, globally, the production, processing and transport of feed account for 45% of the greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector. This paper presents approaches for addressing these challenges in quest for making livestock sector more sustainable. The use of novel human-inedible feed resources such as insect meals, leaf meals, protein isolates, single cell protein produced using waste streams, protein hydrolysates, spineless cactus, algae, co-products of the biofuel industry, food wastes among others, has enormous prospects. Efficient use of grasslands also offers possibilities for increasing carbon sequestration, land reclamation and livestock productivity. Opportunities also exist for decreasing feed wastages by simple and well proven practices such as use of appropriate troughs, increase in efficiency of harvesting crop residues and their conversion to complete feeds especially in the form of densified feed blocks or pellets, feeding as per the nutrient requirements, among others. Available evidence have been presented to substantiate arguments that: (a) for successful and sustained adoption of a feed technology, participation of the private sector and a sound business plan are required, (b) for sustainability of the livestock production systems, it is also important to consider the consumption of animal products and a case has been presented to assess future needs of animal source foods based on their requirements for healthy living, (c) for dairy animals, calculation of Emission Intensity based on the lifetime lactation rather than one lactation may also be considered and (d) for assessment of the efficiency of livestock production systems a holistic approach is required that takes into consideration social dimensions and net human-edible protein output from the system in addition to carbon and water footprints. © 2018 The Animal Consortium.","animal product consumption; climate change; food security; human-inedible; novel feed","biofuel; animal; animal food; catering service; climate change; human; livestock; Animal Feed; Animals; Biofuels; Climate Change; Food Supply; Humans; Livestock",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038021665

Based on a multidisciplinary, integrated approach, the present contribution discusses the role of traditional agricultural systems in ecosystem services provision, considering together economic sustainability and the medium-term ecological benefits. A permanent monitoring of rural areas specialized in traditional crop production such as olive and vine may support optimal selection of cultivars finely adapted to a warm climate. A competitive agricultural system may consider human well-being, social equity, and conservation of natural resources, to ensure a high level of services for current and future generations.

The irrigation sector is the largest consumer of water in the country, accounting for about 62% of water utilisation, but also losing 30–40%. Given the threat of drought and climate change, efficient irrigation systems have become a necessity, especially in the smallholder farming sector where most losses occur. Smallholder irrigation schemes (SIS) were developed to improve rural livelihoods through sustainable food production for food security and poverty alleviation, but these development objectives remain largely unfulfilled. The objectives of this review were to assess challenges facing SIS and explore opportunities for revitalising the schemes. The focus was on government policy and strategies to support smallholder farmers. A review of government policy showed that although the needs and interests of smallholder farmers are high on the national agenda, there is insufficient financial support to the sector, suggesting that smallholder agriculture is not really seen as a potential driver of the economy. The core focus of the government on repairing irrigation infrastructure while neglecting the soft components relating to capacity building has partly been blamed for the failure of SIS in South Africa. Capacity building is one of the missing links in smallholder irrigation development and many failures have been attributed to lack of adequately trained farmers and extension staff, particularly in irrigation water management. Land tenure insecurity has been singled out as a major institutional challenge leading to poor performance of irrigation schemes. The diversity of schemes means that different kinds of interventions are needed to respond to varying farmers’ needs, resources and agricultural contexts. These findings point to the need to balance the soft and hard components of the irrigation schemes for sustainability. It is therefore evident that the government needs to review its priorities in revitalisation of SIS. Land tenure policies allowing increased access to arable land need to be developed urgently, together with the promotion of alternative cropping systems that are suitable for the smallholder farming sector. © 2018, South African Water Research Commission.

In this study, a process-based agricultural module has been coupled with the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM-AG2.0) for assessing how multiple environmental factors (climate change, atmospheric CO2 concentration, tropospheric O3, and nitrogen deposition) and human activities (land use/cover change, nitrogen fertilizer use, and irrigation) have affected the crop growth, development, yield, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and water cycles in agroecosystems. Here we describe the model structure for simulating crop growth, development, and yield formation in the DLEM-AG2.0, and then we validate the model using field observations and a national yield survey for three major crops (wheat, maize, and rice) in China during 1980–2012. Results show that the DLEM-AG2.0 is capable of simulating the dynamic processes of phenological development, leaf growth expansion, biomass accumulation, biomass allocation, and yield formation for wheat, maize, and rice with normalized root mean square errors of the simulations of less than 20%. Our model-based yield estimation for the three major crops at the national scale for the period 1980–2012 is generally consistent with the national yield survey in China. The crop representation in the DLEM-AG2.0 is flexible for extrapolating to a global scale after rigorous testing with both site-specific and regional observations. Further advancement of agricultural modeling within the global land modeling framework will require consideration of human perception and behavior for adapting and mitigating global change. ©2018.

In 2014, the State of Hawaii called climate change “a matter of security” that directly threatens “economic systems - food, water, energy, biodiversity and health” and has called for “actionable information for local decision making.” According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the burden of human morbidity attributable to climate change is relatively small although not well quantified. Nevertheless, generic climate change impacts are often used to justify actions without adequate supporting local evidence. This paper analyzes Hawaii's health risks in relation to air pollution, heat extremes, ultraviolet radiation, and weather extremes and finds that Hawaii's natural geography, robust water, and sanitation infrastructure render the islands less vulnerable to many of the often-mentioned climate change threats. It concludes that the health security threat posed by climate change effects on Hawaii's physical environment over the next 35 years is slight in most areas and moderate with regard to ecosystem health. Because all global communities tend to be both discrete and unique in their vulnerability, it recommends the collection of grassroots, community-based resilience data to reveal local vulnerabilities that can inform strategic statewide planning. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Climate change; Disaster risk reduction; Hawaii; Health security; Preparedness",,Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048046728

An agricultural oasis is the main site of food security and ecosystem services in arid areas. Recently, the dramatic exploitation of agricultural oases has affected oasis stability, inducing some ecological and environmental issues such as water shortage and land degradation. In this study, the Qira oasis on the southern margin of Tarim Basin, Northwest China, was selected as a study area to examine the spatiotemporal changes in an agricultural oasis and the influence on oasis landscape pattern. Based on the integration of Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and GF-1 images, the agricultural Qira oasis has rapidly increased, with annual change rates of -0.3%, 1.6%, 3.7%, and 1.5% during 1970-1990, 1990-2000, 2000-2013, and 2013-2016, respectively. With the agricultural oasis expansion, the agricultural land has increased from 91.10 km2 in 1970 to 105.04 km2 in 2016. The percentage of farmland area has increased by 15.3% in 2016 compared with that in 1970. The natural vegetation is decreasing owing to the reclamation of desert-oasis ecotone. The oasis landscape change and pattern are mainly affected by agricultural expansion under water-saving technological utilization, land use policy, and regional economic development demand. The expansion of agricultural oasis is alarming due to human overexploitation. Thus, the government should adjust the layout of agricultural development and pay considerable attention to the oasis environment sustainability. This study can provide a valuable reference on the impact of climate change and human activities on a landscape. © 2018 by the authors.","Agricultural oasis expansion; Landscape change; Oasis; Tarim Basin","agricultural development; agricultural land; arid region; climate change; economic development; ecosystem service; food security; human activity; land reclamation; land use change; landscape change; oasis agriculture; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; China; Tarim Basin; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048322682

In order to meet the food demand of the growing world population, a faster rate of genetic gains leading to productivity enhancement for major crops is required. Grain legumes are an essential commodity in optimal human diets and animal feed because of their unique nutritional composition. Currently, limited water is a major constraint in grain legume production. Root system architecture (RSA) is an important developmental and agronomic trait, which plays vital roles in plant adaptation and productivity under water-limited environments. A deep and proliferative root system helps extract sufficient water and nutrients under these stress conditions. The integrated genetics and genomics approach to dissect molecular processes from genome to phenome is key to achieve increased water capture and use efficiency through developing better root systems. Success in crop improvement under drought depends on discovery and utilization of genetic variations existing in the germplasm. In this review, we summarize current progress in the genetic diversity in major legume crops, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with RSA, and the importance and applications of recent discoveries associated with the beneficial root traits towards better RSA for enhanced drought tolerance and yield. © 2018 The Author(s).

Forests and land devoted to tree crops do not only supply essential edible products to humans and animals, but also additional goods such as paper or wood. They also prevent soil erosion, support microbial, animal, and plant biodiversity, play key roles in nutrient and water cycling processes, and mitigate the effects of climate change acting as carbon dioxide sinks. Hence, the health of forests and tree cropping systems is of particular significance. In particular, soil/rhizosphere/root-associated microbial communities (known as microbiota) are decisive to sustain the fitness, development, and productivity of trees. These benefits rely on processes aiming to enhance nutrient assimilation efficiency (plant growth promotion) and/or to protect against a number of (a)biotic constraints. Moreover, specific members of the microbial communities associated with perennial tree crops interact with soil invertebrate food webs, underpinning many density regulation mechanisms. This review discusses belowground microbiota interactions influencing the growth of tree crops. The study of tree-(micro)organism interactions taking place at the belowground level is crucial to understand how they contribute to processes like carbon sequestration, regulation of ecosystem functioning, and nutrient cycling. A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between roots and their associate microbiota can also facilitate the design of novel sustainable approaches for the benefit of these relevant agro-ecosystems. Here, we summarize the methodological approaches to unravel the composition and function of belowground microbiota, the factors influencing their interaction with tree crops, their benefits and harms, with a focus on representative examples of Biological Control Agents (BCA) used against relevant biotic constraints of tree crops. Finally, we add some concluding remarks and suggest future perspectives concerning the microbiota-assisted management strategies to sustain tree crops. © 2018 Mercado-Blanco, Abrantes, Barra Caracciolo, Bevivino, Ciancio, Grenni, Hrynkiewicz, Kredics and Proença.","Belowground microbiota; Biological control agents; Endophytes; Mycorrhiza; Phytoparasitic nematodes; Plant-growth-promoting microorganisms; Soil-borne pathogens; Tree crops","RNA 16S; abiotic stress; cell viability; climate change; colony forming unit; crop production; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; epifluorescence microscopy; fluorescence in situ hybridization; Fusarium wilt; genetic variability; metabolomics; metagenomics; microbial community; mycorrhiza; nonhuman; phytoremediation; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; soil erosion; soil microflora; tree",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048050578

Soil's components and ecological functions have been dramatically affected by rapid urbanization in recent decades. This is especially true for peri-urban ecosystems. A peri-urban ecosystem comprises the interaction and transition zones between urban and rural or natural ecosystems. Soils in peri-urban ecosystems are identified with both urban and rural/natural ecosystems' structural and functional features, and are prone to being affected by urbanization pressures. Soils in peri-urban ecosystems provide essential life-support functions and ecosystem services for urban and rural residents, including food supply, water purification, water conservation, contamination interception, leisure and entertainment services, cultural services, and more. Under rapid urbanization, a large area of agricultural and natural landscapes are converted to urban landscapes. Soils in peri-urban ecosystems therefore tend to be significantly disturbed because of increasing human activities, which change the soil processes and reduce the quality and diversity of soil functions such as food production, pollution attenuation, hydrological cycling, and energy balance. The inherent conflicts between urbanization and soil security have been studied for a long time. As urbanization levels in peri-urban ecosystems have increased, soil security problems in peri-urban ecosystems have been a key issue in recent studies. This study reviews published literature concerning soil security in peri-urban ecosystems and aims to contribute to scientific understanding of the interrelations between soil security and urbanization. Statistical analysis showed that the number of published papers concerning peri-urban ecosystems rapidly increased after 2000, especially in the past 5 years. Many studies concerning soil security were focused on urbanization' s influence on soil processes in urban areas, including cropland loss, food production, climate change, and other processes linked with soils. However, only a limited number of studies that focused on peri-urban areas were found. The soil security problems in peri-urban ecosystem areas were often ignored by both rural and urban ecosystems research. In this review, the particularity and complexity of soil security in peri-urban ecosystems are discussed. In summary, we suggest that future peri-urban studies should focus on the following issues: (1) exploring comparative studies at a large scale under different urban sprawl modes, (2) exploring the tradeoff of ecosystem services in the framework of soil security in peri-urban ecosystems, and perspectives on current solutions for soil security in peri-urban ecosystems are proposed, (3) exploring the sources of contaminants in soil and their co-contamination in peri-urban ecosystems, and optimizing landscape patterns to promote soil security and ecosystem services, and (4) considering the sustainable development goals of peri-urban ecosystems and highlighting the multi-dimensional role of soil security in sustainable policy and management. Because soils in peri-urban ecosystems have their own unique set of socioeconomic and ecological features, soil security should be emphasized for understanding the environmental response to global urbanization. © 2018 Science Press.

Investment in research and in relevant quality higher education, responding to local needs, is a priority for building the knowledge economy based on human capital, knowledge created by basic research to stimulate innovation, and introduction of new technologies to overcome unemployment and poverty. Delivery of problem-oriented research by universities, research centers and corporate entities is strongly linked to the development and creation of wealth. Indicators show that UAE & Qatar are leading the Arab countries in the global competitiveness index (2016-2017).

In this regard, the implementation of urban and peri-urban agroforestry (UPAF) systems - associated with the integration of urban food systems into urban planning - can greatly support the provision of ecosystem services to urban dwellers, thus contributing to the improvement of their livelihood through increased food and nutrition security, energy and fresh water availability, regulation of local climate, carbon sequestration, maintenance of genetic diversity, recreation opportunities and health improvement. In this sense, UPAF is emerging as a new urban practice addressed to promote sustainable land use as well as the integration between urban and rural development.

In this context, the aim of this chapter is to outline, through a review of the relevant literature and case studies from both developed and developing countries, the benefits deriving from the implementation of UPAF systems and highlight how these practices can support the improvement of urban sustainability and resilience, particularly in terms of enhancement of provisioning, cultural, regulating and supporting ecosystem services. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Ecosystem services; Land tenure conflicts; Resilience; Sustainability; Urban agroforestry; Urban planning",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060810855

Agroforestry is a promising strategy for deriving a range of benefits, such as food and water security, ecosystem health, energy security, and human health particularly in developing nations. Agroforestry is also posited as a means of producing various ecosystem services necessary for mitigation and adaptation to climate change impacts. In spite of these expected benefits, the adoption of agroforestry policies has been limited, and the potential contributions of agroforestry to resilience and sustainable development remain unrealized. Drawing from theoretical insights in ecosystem management and adaptive governance, this chapter discusses the potential benefits of managing agroforestry systems as complex adaptive social-ecological systems. Ecosystem-based adaptive governance holds promise as a framework for increasing the adoption of agroforestry as a land-use strategy for achieving sustainable development and social-ecological resilience by promoting a more inclusive and dynamic approach to developing locally-based agroforestry models.

However, our understanding of the realistic sustainable feasibility of the global lands for BECCS remains uncertain. In this study, we assess the impact of BECCS deployment scenarios on the land systems including land use, water resources, and ecosystem services. Specifically, we assess three land-use scenarios to achieve the total amount of 3.3 GtC year−1 (annual negative emission level required for IPCC-RCP 2.6) emission reduction by growing bioenergy crops which requires huge use of global agricultural and forest lands and water. Our study shows that (1) vast conversion of food cropland into rainfed bio-crop cultivation yields a considerable loss of food production that may not be tolerable considering the population increase in the future. (2) When irrigation is applied to bio-crop production, the bioenergy crop productivity is enhanced. This suppresses the necessary area for bio-crop production to half, and saves the land for agricultural productions. However, water consumption is doubled and this may exacerbate global water stress. (3) If conversion of forest land for bioenergy crop cultivation is allowed without protecting the natural forests, large areas of tropical forest could be used for bioenergy crop production. Forest biomass and soil carbon stocks are reduced, implying degradation of the climate regulation and other ecosystem services. These results suggest that without a careful consideration of the land use for bioenergy crop production, a large-scale implementation of BECCS could negatively impact food, water and ecosystem services that are supporting fundamental human sustainability. © The Author(s) 2017.","BECCS; Ecosystem service; Land use; Sustainability; Water resources",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047615688

Polar benthic organisms have adapted to the marked seasonality charac-terising their habitats by concentrating foraging and reproductive activity in summer months, when inputs from sympagic and pelagic producers increase. While this enables the persistence of biodiverse food webs, the mechanisms underlying changes in resource use and nutrient transfer are poorly understood. Thus, our understanding of how temporal and spatial variations in the supply of resources may affect food web structure and functioning is limited. By means of C and N isotopic analyses of two key Antarctic benthic consumers (Adamussium colbecki, Bivalvia, and Sterechinus neumayeri, Echinoidea) and Bayesian mixing models, we describe changes in trophic niche and nutrient transfer across trophic levels associated with the long- and short-term diet and body size of specimens sampled in midsummer in both shallow and deep waters. Samplings occurred soon after the sea-ice broke up at Tethys Bay, an area characterised by extreme seasonality in sea-ice coverage and productivity in the Ross Sea. In the long term, the trophic niche was broader and variation between specimens was greater, with intermediate-size specimens generally consuming a higher number of resources than small and large specimens. The coupling of energy channels in the food web was consequently more direct than in the short term. Sediment and benthic algae were more frequently consumed in the long term, before the sea-ice broke up, while consumers specialised on sympagic algae and plankton in the short term. Regardless of the time scale, sympagic algae were more frequently consumed in shallow waters, while plankton was more frequently consumed in deep waters. Our results suggest a strong temporal relationship between resource availability and the trophic niche of benthic consumers in Antarctica. Potential climate-driven changes in the timing and quality of nutrient inputs may have profound implications for the structure of polar food webs and the persistence of their constituent species, which have adapted their trophic niches to a highly predictable schedule of resource inputs. © 2018 Calizza et al.

The increasingly recognized concept of ecosystem service could help to address this duality. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework based on a soil crop model to investigate how agricultural management and pedoclimatic conditions affect the joint production of marketed and non-marketed ecosystem services through underlying ecosystem functions in apple orchards. The ecosystem services considered on an annual scale were soil nitrogen availability, climate regulation, water regulation and fruit production. Ecosystem functions and services were described by specific indicators that were quantified using the STICS soil crop model. This model was parameterized using data collected on two experimental apple orchard sites under conventional and low-input or organic management in southeastern France. The interdependencies between environmental components, cultural operations and ecosystem functions were dynamically integrated by the model and highlighted significant interactions between the indicators of ecosystem services. Thus, the service indicators soil organic nitrogen variation and the prevention of nitrogen denitrification and of leaching were positively correlated and in conflict with soil mean nitrate concentration and mean soil humidity. They were also linked negatively to nitrogen mineralization enhanced by irrigation and positively to soil carbon sequestration impacted by fertilization; these two functions were impacted by soil conditions. Yield and carbon sequestration presented a strong synergy and were positively correlated to nitrogen absorption increased by mineral fertilization. Globally, nitrogen fertilization management and planting density were particularly important for the delivery of multiple ecosystem services, but soil and climate effects were far from negligible, especially for nitrogen and water-related services. The ecosystem service profiles of the studied cropping systems were diversified, with contrasted profiles showing high yield and carbon sequestration but low prevention of nitrogen denitrification and of nitrogen leaching, and more balanced profiles. The STICS crop model made it possible to quantify and analyze profiles of ecosystem services and should be helpful in instrumenting the dialogue between fruit growers and other stakeholders by simulating scenarios to optimize multiple services. However, it has to be improved to address the impact of grass cover on soil functions and the long-term functioning of apple orchards. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Apple orchard; Crop model; Cropping system; Multiple ecosystem services; Pedoclimatic condition; STICS","absorption; agricultural management; climate conditions; denitrification; ecosystem service; environmental factor; experimental study; farming system; food production; leaching; numerical model; nutrient availability; orchard; parameterization; regulatory framework; soil nitrogen; Malus x domestica",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041928625

Single pressures are rare and, in the future, models must be able to examine multiple factors affecting living marine resources such as interactions between: i) climate-driven changes in temperature regimes and acidification, ii) reductions in water quality due to eutrophication, iii) the introduction of alien invasive species, and/or iv) (over-)exploitation by fisheries. Statistical (correlative) approaches can be used to detect historical patterns which may not be relevant in the future. Advancing predictive capacity of changes in distribution and productivity of living marine resources requires explicit modelling of biological and physical mechanisms. New formulations are needed which (depending on the question) will need to strive for more realism in ecophysiology and behaviour of individuals, life history strategies of species, as well as trophodynamic interactions occurring at different spatial scales. Coupling existing models (e.g. physical, biological, economic) is one avenue that has proven successful. However, fundamental advancements are needed to address key issues such as the adaptive capacity of species/groups and ecosystems. The continued development of end-to-end models (e.g., physics to fish to human sectors) will be critical if we hope to assess how multiple pressures may interact to cause changes in living marine resources including the ecological and economic costs and trade-offs of different spatial management strategies.

Even though primary productivity by plants and microorganisms is relatively low, species richness and taxonomical diversity can be fairly high. Taxonomically different organisms evolved traits to cope with water stress and often similar life forms arose due to convergent evolution. Typical desert organisms show traits that allow them to avoid periods of extreme aridity in inactive stages and/or to store water for use during drought; a few organisms evolved traits to tolerate the lack of water altogether.

Arctic peatlands are mostly represented by ""frozen"" mires with much of their organic deposits remaining frozen throughout the year, whose water regime and other characteristics are strongly dependent on permafrost. Primary production in arctic peatlands is low, but the tendency for peat to accumulate is enhanced by the low decomposition rates. The peat layer in arctic peatlands is not thick, and only in rare cases does the peat exceed 4-6 m in depth. Three main permafrost processes are responsible for the variability of arctic frozen peatlands: thermokarst, frost heaving, and cracking. Arctic peatland diversity and distribution across the landscape depends on the climate conditions, permafrost presence, and hydrology-connected landscape dynamics, and adheres to a characteristic pattern which is beneficial to consider in inventory, mapping, or planning of wetland management. The ecosystem diversity of arctic peatlands is presented by paludified shallow peatlands; ""frozen"" peatland types such as polygon mires, peat plateaus, and palsa mires; and ""nonfrozen"" peatland types like patterned string fens, raised bogs, riparian mires, coastal tundra, and some types of coastal marsh. Arctic ecosystems are characterized by low species diversity, and typical species are highly specialized and intimately linked to their habitats. The short growing season limits annual production and the ecological niche capacity of these species. Arctic peatlands are highly integrated ecosystems which are extremely fragile to both natural and human-induced perturbations. With climate change, the arctic region will continue to warm more rapidly than the global mean. Peat, as a thermo-isolating material, plays a crucial role in minimizing permafrost thaw. However, climate change-induced peatland degradation introduces positive feedback with permafrost thaw. Accompanying rapid in situ peat decomposition is an increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, specifically methane from saturated peat water and that which was formerly bound in frozen permafrost. Development in such areas often ignores the special hydrological and ecological characteristics that are central to the productivity of these areas. Increased development of the oil and gas industry and its supporting transport infrastructure significantly fragments the landscape and disrupts its hydrology. Even traditional land uses such as reindeer herding are being industrialized. The resulting changes in peatland status will in turn restrict use of the land by the indigenous people who have traditionally depended on peatlands for food including herded reindeer, game, and fish. Thus, there is an urgent need to promote sustainable practices. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2018.

In addition to 1.32 million full-time fisherfolk, 14.7 million people are involved in aquaculture in Bangladesh. Though all of Bangladesh is more or less prone to adverse impacts of climate change, the northern and northwestern drought-prone areas and coastal regions are particularly sensitive because of specific hydrometeorological, climatic, and human-induced hazards. Erratic rain, irregular rainfall, and temperature changes affect the readiness of fish for breeding. In 2009–2010, extreme weather caused late maturity of fish for breeding in the Mymensingh region—the largest aquaculture zone in the country. Fish farmers are struggling with higher production costs due to water scarcity, higher and lower temperatures, day–night temperature fluctuations, and lower productivity of ponds. Hatchery production has also declined because of such causes. The Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan have considered the fisheries sector as one of the potentially most threatened areas to be targeted. The fisheries sector differs from mainstream agriculture and has distinct interactions and needs with respect to climate change. Capture fisheries have unique features of natural resource harvesting linked with ecosystem production processes. Aquaculture complements and increasingly adds to the supply and, though it is more similar to agriculture in its interactions, it has important links with capture fisheries. Most indigenous fish are migratory and rely on seasonal flooding for spawning cues and access to larval rearing habitats (floodplains). Habitat destruction also has a significant impact, as does lack of flooding/rain—an obvious impact of climate change in the last few decades. Since the economic impacts of climate change will have to be borne by individuals, communities, and the government, there is a need to evolve a climate-resilient development strategy involving all of the relevant sectors, including aquaculture. Only eco-friendly, improved, and innovative management practices with insights into technological, environmental, and socioeconomic concerns can mitigate the impact of climate change on aquaculture in Bangladesh and ensure sustainable fish diversity and production. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067984224

In this respect, the ecological human imprint is a function of all the parameters that interact between the power of ecosystem productivity and human interactions and activities on a particular ecosystem or the demand from that ecosystem. The present paper will cover and analyses the ecosystems’ productivity and the human demand from the ecosystems. It will produce comprehensive analyses in measuring the possibility of capabilities of the ecosystems to provide goods and services to the human beings on our planet Earth. Further, the paper will discuss the models that can be used in measuring the sustainability of ecosystem and in particular, water resources and what we should be doing to maintain the earth healthy ecosystems. In this respect, the paper will assess and introduce a comprehensive model called Ecological Human Imprint (EHI) and water resources change of US (EHI-WR-US) that can describe the status of our ecosystems’ productivities and the impacts of changing of water resources’ availability and human population within the USA Earth boundaries. Furthermore, the paper will provide some answers to the human issues in USA; water resources change impacts as the results of human activities. Further, the model will provide warning to the current trend in use and abuse of our natural ecosystems and what will be expecting from these ecosystems to provide the human needs in response to the current use of US ecosystems that exist. It is clear from the analysis of (EHI-WR-US) that the USA will reach 450 million people or more in the year 2050, and this will overload the ecosystems with heavy demands and consumptions for goods, and services that these ecosystems can produce or cannot produce for the next generations. It is expected that model will assess the impacts of the EHI of human population in US from ecological transformation of land-use, and economic impacts, locally in US. From the analysis, the model predicted that the US biological capacity will be degrading to the extent that the ecosystems will not be able to support the growing populations, and there will be a shortage of food and other services. It is expected that the need will be about twice the land of current land of US to meet the demands from our ecosystems to support the growing population and their life style. In this model, we used Stella Software to predict the impacts of the EHI for the next century and what we should expect beyond quantitatively. The model developed on relaxed assumption, moderate assumption and conservative assumption of human population growth and in consequence, the US EHI biological capacity with all its components, including energy and impacts of climate change that affects the water resources and on the natural resources and availability of cycling natural resource. Accordingly, the warming and related climate changes proceed more rapidly than generally expected before. Weather extremes can cause unsustainable summer heat along with lack of water, fire causing vegetation to burn and will allow loss of forest vegetation. This will end of the destruction and loss of available food and in consequence, the famine and human death. The paper will conclude and set up several recommendations to avoid irreversible impacts of human beings on the ecosystems and our global environment, including the impact of climate change and in consequence, the water resources and finally the sustainability of our ecosystems.

Soil organic matter comprising of approximately 58% of soil organic carbon (SOC) is the basis of many soil functions and ecosystem services, including provision of food and fiber, habitats for biodiversity, climate regulation, water filtration and purification, and human heritage. The importance of SOC in maintaining the capacity of soils to perform multiple ecosystem processes has been recognized by farmers in all ancient civilizations. Managing SOC through sustainable agricultural and land use practices has become a widely acknowledged strategy to combat land degradation and desertification, as well as to provide food security in a changing climate. Several national and international efforts have been initiated to implement practical programs of SOC management and the types of farming methods used to promote it. Enhancing and sustaining SOC to increase soil health is also pertinent to advancing Sustainable Development goals of the U.N. including no hunger, good health and well-being, clean water, climate action, and life on land.

Even though surface water is abundant, Lao PDR is still vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate variability and climate change - flooding and heavy monsoon rains are common but the country also experiences long and prolonged dry seasons with pronounced and common water scarcity. Shortages, both spatially and temporally are increasingly being met with supplies from groundwater. As groundwater management is still at a very basic level and perhaps the single most important constraint to progress, the goal of our SEG-Geoscientists without Borders project is to build human and institutional capacity in-country and resilience in agricultural productivity through sustainable use of groundwater for local farmers on the Vientiane Plain, Lao PDR. The project is a collaboration with a number of Lao project partners, made up primarily of stakeholders from government, university, private-sector representatives and the local communities. This collaboration is intended to build and strengthen capacity of our Lao partners through the application and use of hydrogeophysical techniques to identify and characterize the groundwater aquifer systems along a transect on the Vientiane Plain. The project has provided local undergraduate and postgraduate training opportunities for a number of students by introducing and training students in the use of a number of different geophysical techniques, including frequency and time domain electromagnetic induction (FDEM and TDEM), electrical resistivity, ground penetrating radar (GPR), borehole geophysical logging (NMR), and hydrogeological field assessment skills. Specifically, we aimed in this project to: (1) train students and staff of the National University of Laos and staff of the Department of Water Resources (DWR), Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Lao PDR in the use of near-surface geophysics, as well as the collection and use of complementary hydrogeophysical data sets; (2) involve local community members in raising awareness of proper groundwater management and water use for increasing sustainable food production by providing training and water quality field kits for long-term deployment in the community; (3) improve groundwater management by scientific understanding of the hydrogeological system underlying the Vientiane Plain including detailed water quality analysis of the groundwater to ensure that it meets water quality guidelines for the intended use; and (5) validate and 'ground-truth' the new geophysical data sets with the collection of hydrogeological and hydrochemistry data and water balance modelling; all information needed to improve the chances of making informed water management decisions. This project will contribute to the development of reliable hydrogeological maps that can be used to improve the prospects for securing good supplies and delineate good and poor quality water to lower the risk of well failure and groundwater contamination on the Vientiane Plain. It will assist local community members, farmers and government to expand groundwater development for agricultural production and strengthen the resilience of agriculture to climatic uncertainties. The scientific information has the potential to benefit rural livelihood enhancement through the sustainable use of groundwater and ensure that groundwater use for other purposes including domestic and drinking supplies, as well as for ecosystem services are not compromised. The study will add considerable scientific weight to ensuring that groundwater in Lao PDR provides a reliable, safe and secure resource into the future. We recently completed a large training / data collection campaign over the field area in the Vientiane Basin.

Also, hillslopes are frequently used in agriculture. Soil erosion caused by water is a natural phenomenon, but the negative effects are accentuated by human interventions in the landscape. Soil erosion and nutrient loss are detrimental to agricultural products, food security, and the sustainability of ecosystem functioning. In recent decades, the increased using of chemical fertilizer and corresponding nutrient loss from inclined farmland owing to agricultural activities have received increasing attention from specialists in domain of agriculture, hydrology and environment protection. This paper present the possibility to modeling of processes associated with soil erosion by water on hillslopes with WEPP model. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model developed by United States Department of Agriculture – Agricultural Research Service, is a process-based, distributed parameter, continuous simulation, erosion prediction model, is applicable to hillslope erosion processes (sheet and rill erosion), as well as simulation of the hydrologic and erosion processes on small watersheds. Processes considered in hillslope profile model applications include rill and interrill erosion, sediment transport and deposition, infiltration, soil consolidation, residue and canopy effects on soil detachment and infiltration, surface sealing, rill hydraulics, surface runoff, plant growth, residue decomposition, percolation, evaporation, transpiration, snow melt, frozen soil effects on infiltration and erodibility, climate, tillage effects on soil properties, effects of soil random roughness, and contour effects including potential overtopping of contour ridges.

This stems from the realisation that most of the country’s areas and sectors are already showing signs of vulnerability to the change and variability in the climate system. Accordingly, climate change adaptation is no longer an option but an urgent requirement. However, scholarly attention to the topic has largely remained fragmented in synchrony with the segmented sectoral policy interventions in various adaptation efforts. Research that analyses the major factors underpinning successful adaptation is highly timely given that most of the empirical evidence point towards gaps in adaptive capacities across the country’s climate sensitive sectors. Driven by the acknowledgement that Zimbabwe’s adaptation efforts are chiefly stymied by its predisposition to non-climatic drivers of vulnerability, this paper shows that the country is already showing numerous signs of limits to adaptation. It draws the evidence from various insights and experiences in the agriculture, water, human settlements and health, energy and industry, and biodiversity sectors. Specifically, this report serves to document existing evidence of challenges in successful adaptation in order to guide adaptation policy and practice. In addition, it is intended that this illumination would provide Zimbabwe and other countries, in similar adaptation failure milieu, to formulate strategies meant to build resilience in areas and sectors already showing signs of maladaptation. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Disaster; Food security; Maladaptation; Poverty; Resilience; Zimbabwe",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056549241

Hence, two alternatives are being proposed to be integrated in the current wastewater treatment plant in the Philippines: biological nutrient removal and nutrient recovery systems. Biological nutrient removal technologies (BNRT) utilize microorganisms to minimize the nutrient content in the effluent streams to the standard limit while leaving high nutrient concentrations to the sludge that is typically transported as waste to landfill. The nutrient recovery system aims to recover phosphorus and nitrogen in the form of struvite (NH4MgPO46H2O) fertiliser from sludge through chemical precipitation. The two proposed systems have been studied in other settings but their effectiveness has not been studied in the Metro Manila setting. There is a need to systematically assess the environmental effects brought about by the proposed systems in Metro Manila, whether beneficial or adverse, in the context of agriculture, food and energy consumption, and wastewater. A holistic evaluation of the environmental benefits and burdens was done using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework considering a cradle-to-grave approach of three scenarios: 1) current wastewater treatment system scenario; 2) biological nutrient recovery technology; and 3) nutrient recovery system. The environmental impact assessment was done using IMPACT2002+ methodology with the following impact indicators: human health, ecosystem quality, climate change and resources. The life cycle assessment of the scenarios shows the potential of the proposed retrofit wastewater systems for Metro Manila that extends to a more sustainable approach in dealing with issues such as water pollution, climate change, resource depletion and even food security. Moreover, a baseline understanding of the food-water-energy-nutrient nexus in the Philippines was established which can be the basis for future life cycle sustainability assessment studies. © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Biological water treatment; Climate change; Effluents; Energy utilization; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental technology; Eutrophication; Food supply; Life cycle; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Recovery; Retrofitting; River pollution; Sustainable development; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Biological nutrient removal; Chemical precipitation; Environmental benefits; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle sustainability assessments; Wastewater effluents; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment system; Nutrients",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051369036

Associated impacts can be seen not only in the physical worlds with droughts, rising seas, wild weather and extreme temperatures, but also in the social and economic world. Secondary impacts (Butler and Harley, 2010) on food and water security and human health (Adlong and Dietsch, 2014; McMichael, 2013; Franchini and Mannucci, 2015; Friel, 2010) will affect not only governments, corporate profits and the economy but also job security for communities across the world. The changing climate will bring with it both risks and opportunities. It seems that the threat of disaster as a consequence of climate change offers an opportunity to develop a socially just, culturally respectful and sustainable world with indigenous wisdom paving the way. According to Teixeira and Krings: The communities most affected by environmental injustices are often the same communities where social workers are entrenched in service provision at the individual, family, and community level. (2015: 1) People with limited financial resources are often victims of discrimination, inequity and potentially most vulnerable to the impacts of an unsustainable world. These groups often have established relationships with both statutory and non-government agencies and particularly social workers (Drolet and Sampson, 2014; Gray and Coates, 2015; Grise-Owens, Miller, and Owens, 2014). They will also be further disadvantaged by the impacts of climate change (Lawler, 2011; New Zealand College of Public Health Medicine, 2013). Paradoxically, some of these groups have incredible resilience and resourcefulness demonstrated in a range of creative solutions, movements and communities across the globe that offer alternative approaches to living outside of the mainstream (Tigger-Ross et al., 2015). Social work, being the only profession with social justice embedded in its definition needs to creatively offer support in building resilience and adaptation to impacts of climate change and globalisation (Appleby et al., 2015). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Lena Dominelli; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050518741

There is now clear evidence of the ways in which anthropogenic climate change is already impacting upon both natural systems and human well-being (IPCC, 2014; CSIRO, 2015; Wahlquist, 2017).

Within the latter, an estimated 75 percent of renewable surface water resources originate from five highland watersheds: Mount Elgon, the Cherangani Hills, the Mau Forest complex, Mount Kenya, and the Aberdares range (UNEP, 2012). In such a context, these areas take on considerable significance not only to conserve biodiversity, but also more broadly for sustainable development and public administration. Known in Kenyan popular discourse as the country’s “five water towers,” these highland forests support the livelihoods of millions of small-scale farmers, pastoralists, and freshwater fishing communities. As the most recent “status report” from the Kenya Water Towers Agency - the state organization responsible for forested water catchment areas - puts it, rather strikingly: The term “Water Towers of Kenya” refers to montane forests - the mountainous regions that are sources of water. Through their watershed function, Kenya’s Water Towers supply Kenya’s drinking water, its energy, water for irrigation, industry, water for food and other purposes. But all this is threatened by a combination of factors, including human encroachment, climate change, environmental degradation, and unplanned dams and irrigation projects that have a devastating effect on the ecological infrastructure. The outcome is a real threat to Kenya’s water security, stability and surfeit. (KWTA, 2015: 1, emphasis added). And yet, the critical importance of such “ecosystem infrastructure” is not limited to their contribution to water security alone. For example, the UN Environment Program recently estimated economic losses from deforestation in these areas - resulting from the degradation or diminishment of related ecosystem services to downstream industries - to be approximately US$35 million per year, or more than 2.8 times the direct value of profits accruing from sales of timber and other forest products in these areas (UNEP, 2012: 38). Such calculations are characteristic of emerging “natural capital accounting” approaches to the green economy, which are increasingly embraced by both multilateral organizations, donors, and Kenyan state agencies (e.g. GoK, 2013, 2015; KWTA, 2015; UNEP, 2012, 2014). © Cambridge University Press 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048195703

The Senegal River Delta (hereafter, the Delta) represents the area of study of this research as it has been the setting of many socio-environmental changes during the twentieth century (Meunier, 2017). The expected changes include variations in temperatures and rainfall, and the consequent increase of drought episodes (Webber, Gaiser and Ewert, 2014). Moreover, the likely consequences for human societies include an increase in land and soil degradation, a decline in crop yields, problems of access to water, a decrease in biodiversity, and increased health problems (Mbaye et al., 2015; Meunier, 2017 and references therein). According to the data, the risk in Senegal is to register a decrease up to 50% in the crop yields by 2020 (Tremblay, 2016). In addition, anthropogenic activities, such as land-use changes and deforestation, contribute to climatic disturbances in the country (Tremblay, 2016). Thus, vulnerability in SSA is linked especially with the economic centrality of agriculture, lack of adaptation investments, climate change effects on temperature, and exposure of local communities to extreme events (Diack et al., 2015; Tubiello and Fischer, 2007; Wheeler and von Braun, 2013; Brown and Funk, 2008). In this way, climate change poses the issues of global and State-driven climate change measures which are not aligned to local adaptation requirements (Meunier, 2017). Accordingly, some scientific contributions have tried to analyse resilience of indigenous practices and bottom-up adaptation strategies in contrast with intensive systems of production and use of soil (see for example Bakel communities’ resilience in Tremblay, 2016; WB, 2010). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Giuseppe Forino, Sara Bonati and Lina Maria Calandra.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045591284

In tropical rivers, rainfall drives a periodic flood pulse fueling fish production and delivering nutrition to more than 150 million people worldwide. Hydropower will modulate this flood pulse, thereby threatening food security. We identified variance components of the Mekong River flood pulse that predict yield in one of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world. We used these variance components to design an algorithm for a managed hydrograph to explore future yields. This algorithm mimics attributes of discharge variance that drive fishery yield: prolonged low flows followed by a short flood pulse.

Enhanced atmospheric CO2 concentrations provide an opportunity to increase potato yields in the future, but this will only be possible if the potato crop can cope with the other consequences of climate change caused by this rise in CO2. While climate change may impact biotic stress either positively or negatively, abiotic stresses are likely to be greatly increased and become a major threat to potato production. Increasing heat, drought and salinity stress will drive the need for greater understanding of genes, traits and management techniques that allow potato to cope with these stresses. In this review, we identify some of the key physiological and molecular adaptations of potato to these stresses and propose an ideotype which should include (1) optimal stomatal regulation to balance water loss and heat stress in leaves, (2) production of metabolites and transporters to scavenge reactive oxygen species and partition toxic elements, (3) enhanced root systems to maximise water capture, (4) maintenance of tuberisation under stress conditions and (5) stress avoidance by accelerating crop development and reducing time to yield. We discuss potential ways to achieve this ideotype, emphasising the need to benefit from genetic diversity in landrace and wild material by screening for traits in combined stress environments appropriate to future agroecosystems. © 2018, European Association for Potato Research.","Drought; Heat; Maintaining photosynthesis; Root/shoot signalling; Roots; Salinity",,Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044478033

The main purpose of this paper is to provide a review for the major progresses of digital soil mapping in the last decade. First, we briefly described the rise of digital soil mapping and outlined important milestones and their influence, and main paradigms in digital soil mapping. Then, we reviewed the progresses in legacy soil data, environmental covariates, soil sampling, predictive models and the applications of digital soil mapping products. Finally, we summarized the main trends and future prospect as revealed by studies up to now. We concluded that although the digital soil mapping is now moving towards mature to meet various demands of soil information, challenges including new theories, methodologies and applications of digital soil mapping, especially for highly heterogeneous and human-affected environments, still exist and need to be addressed in the future. © 2017 CAAS.

Mountains are fragile ecosystems, projected to endure a higher impact from the increased warming. This study presents modelled CC projections with respect to the suitability for the growth of nine near-treeline plant species of the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau through niche modelling technique using CLIMEX and estimates their potential future distribution and the extent of greening in the region. Two global climate models, CSIRO-MK 3.0 (CS) and MIROCH-H (MR) were used under IPCC A1B and A2 emission scenarios for the year 2050 and 2100. The results indicate that climatic suitability of the nine species expands towards higher elevations into areas that are currently unsuitable while currently suitable areas in many regions become climatically unsuitable in the future. The total climatically suitable area for the nine species at current time is around 1.09 million km2, with an additional 0.68 and 0.35 million km2 becoming suitable by 2050 and 2100 respectively. High elevation belts, especially those lying above 3500 m, will see more climatically suitable areas for the nine species in the future. Cold stress is the main factor limiting current distribution and its decrease will affect the overall expansion of climatic suitability in the region.

Nevertheless, the delta has been threatened by climate change and human activities, particularly the proliferation of hydropower development across the Mekong Basin since the 1990s. However, compared to the well-studied Holocene Mekong Delta, our understanding of the recent 50-year evolution of the Mekong Delta is not sufficient to address these threats. In this study, we used 43-year Landsat images from 1973 to 2015 to investigate the entirety of the Mekong Delta's shoreline, land area and geomorphological changes. We compiled a new and comprehensive GIS database of the dams and irrigations of the Mekong Basin. The goal was to improve our knowledge of the recent evolution of the Mekong Delta and to link the potential impacts of dams and other factors. Our results show that the Mekong Delta is experiencing a significant decrease in the shoreline progradation rate. Currently, 66% of the entire delta shoreline is under erosion. The erosion segments are mainly located on the eastern side of the Ca Mau Peninsula and northwestern side of the delta in the Gulf of Thailand (GoT). Most parts of the shorelines in the estuarine area are still growing, although river sediment continues to decrease. Geomorphological asymmetries, discontinuous shoreline shifts, and sandy beach-ridge sets can be observed in multitemporal images. The entire Mekong Delta experienced a shift from growing to shrinking around 2005 with the gradual increase of the total accumulated installed capacity of the dams over the entire river basin. In the near future, the realization of planned dams, extension of irrigation, groundwater withdrawal, uncontrolled riverbed mining, delta subsidence, sea level rise, and other factors will accelerate the ongoing delta erosion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Geomorphological characteristics; Hydropower development; Mekong Delta; Remote sensing; Shoreline evolution; Shoreline undulation","beach ridge; coastal evolution; dam; environmental impact; geomorphological response; GIS; hydroelectric power; irrigation; landform evolution; Landsat; remote sensing; Gulf of Thailand; Mekong Basin; Mekong Delta; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Viet Nam",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031734095

To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed the daily variability and trends of four climatic factors (reference evapotranspiration, temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation) in China simultaneously using high spatial resolution data from 1960 to 2013. The results indicate that the daily variability of climate system dynamics (quantified by multiplying fractal dimensions of the four climatic factors) in north China was higher than that in south China. For example, the climate system dynamics were more chaotic and with higher nonlinear variation in north China, most notably in Heilongjiang Province, the major grain base of China, posing threats to food security in the context of growing national population.

To meet the food demands of the exponentially increasing population, a massive food production is necessary. Agricultural production on land and aquatic systems pose negative impacts on the earth's ecosystems. Combined effects of climate change, land degradation, cropland losses, water scarcity and species infestations are major causes for loss of agricultural yields up to 25%. Therefore, the world needs a paradigm shift in agriculture development for sustainable food production and security through green revolution and eco-friendly approaches. Hence, agriculture practices must be sustained by the ability of farm land to produce food to satisfy human needs indefinitely as well as having sustainable impacts on the broader environment. The real agricultural challenges of the future as well as for today differ according to their geopolitical and socioeconomic contexts. Therefore, sustainable agriculture must be inclusive and have adaptability and flexibility over time to respond to demands for food production. Considering all these points, this book has been prepared to address and insights to generate awareness of food security and focuses on perspectives of sustainable food production and security towards human society. The book facilitates to describes the classical and recent advancement of technologies and strategies by sustainable way through plant and animal origin including, breeding, pest management, tissue culture, transgenic techniques, bio and phytoremediation, environmental stress and resistance, plant growth enhancing microbes, bio-fertilizer and integrated approaches of food nutrition.

It is apparent that this integrated aquaculture-agriculture system is suited to environmental and hydrological conditions found in specific areas. Production strategies devised by farmers demonstrate that the diversified culture of shrimp with rice is technically feasible. Shrimp-rice agroecosystems exhibit several synergistic effects between systems components that result in efficient resource use and enhanced production, whilst avoiding negative environmental impacts. Integrated cropping enhances agrobiodiversity and reduces dependence on external inputs (agrochemicals, feed and fertiliser). Diversified shrimp-rice culture produces a valuable export crop, stimulating economic development and staple cereal, fish and vegetable crops that enhance human nutrition and food security. The contribution that diversified shrimp-rice agroecosystems make to social-ecological resilience is evaluated using the DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, State, Impacts, Responses) framework. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) associated with prevailing practices are reviewed using the SWOT framework.

To meet this goal, the productivity of crops needs to be increased under harsher climate conditions and with declining soil and water quality. In addition to this, widespread emergence of new pathogens and pests is posing a serious threat to agricultural produce. Plant-microbe interactions may have a beneficial, neutral, or negative effect on one or both partners. The whole world needs to address climate change scenario, by enabling agriculture to adopt climate-friendly practices. Plants host a rich microbiota, which supports plants in nutrition uptake and health management. Phytomicrobiome represents a great reservoir, which can be harnessed to improve the productivity of crops and food quality. A systematic research focused on the understanding of structure and function of phytomicrobiome driven by crop management and environmental factors is critical for devising reliable strategies to improve crop health and productivity in a sustainable way, by reducing chemical inputs and emissions of greenhouse gases.

Impact of climate variability affecting water availability, nutrient levels, soil moisture, temperature, and tropical ozone in crop yield is measured in various studies. Rice, the critical crop in maintaining food security, has high vulnerability to increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events which affects crop growth at macro- and microenvironment. Meanwhile, rising temperatures and consequent rise in sea level can make farming riskier by increasing salinity in the cultivatable lands. Decrease in productivity of rice is mainly related to extreme environmental conditions such as water deficit, high temperature, submergence, salinity, cold, and accumulation of heavy metals apart from higher incidence of pathogens and pests. Crop germplasm, wild relatives, and other species serve as main genetic sources for tolerance. These can be useful in crop breeding as they have had adaptation and acclimation responses developed through natural selection process. Hence, identification of genetic loci, mechanism, and signaling path ways provides a paradigm to improve yield under diverse ecosystem.

Climate change-associated impacts on structure and function of marine food webs, with consequent changes in contaminant transport, fate, and effects, are likely to have significant repercussions to those human populations that rely on fisheries resources for food, recreation, or culture. Published studies on climate change–contaminant interactions with a focus on food web bioaccumulation were systematically reviewed to explore how climate change and ocean acidification may impact contaminant levels in marine food webs. We propose here a conceptual framework to illustrate the impacts of climate change on contaminant accumulation in marine food webs, as well as the downstream consequences for ecosystem goods and services. The potential impacts on social and economic security for coastal communities that depend on fisheries for food are discussed. Climate change–contaminant interactions may alter the bioaccumulation of two priority contaminant classes: the fat-soluble persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), as well as the protein-binding methylmercury (MeHg). These interactions include phenomena deemed to be either climate change dominant (i.e., climate change leads to an increase in contaminant exposure) or contaminant dominant (i.e., contamination leads to an increase in climate change susceptibility). We illustrate the pathways of climate change–contaminant interactions using case studies in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean. The important role of ecological and food web modeling to inform decision-making in managing ecological and human health risks of chemical pollutants contamination under climate change is also highlighted.

Even though large volume of literature materials is available of land use/land cover (LU/LC) change for many areas, very little is known of it in the floodplain of the Sokoto Rima River Basin of Nigeria despite the basin’s strategic importance. Thus, this study characterized the basin’s LU/LC and its change using computer-based digital classification of near-anniversary Landsat 5 TM imagery of November 23, 1998, and Landsat 8 OLI of December 2, 2013. The results of the digital classification were complimented with field-based observations on major observable characteristics of every LU/LC identified. Thirteen classes (forest area, dense grassland, grassy fallow, grazed open grassland, open cultivation, open grain fallow farmland, pepper cultivation, rice farmland, scrubland, sugarcane farmland, dry bare land, sand deposit and wetland/water) were characterized and the nature and extent of their changes assessed. 40 % of the basin’s uses is under cultivation, 22 % is under fallow, 27 % is either degraded or non-cultivable, while 11 % is forested. Change events include forest loss, increase in area cultivated, expansion of shrub/scrubland and pervasiveness of grazing. The changes were more pronounced in the upper than either the central and southern segments of the basin. In general LU/LC changes in the basin are reflection of increased human population pressure and effects of climate change.

The ecosystems of the Israeli Mediterranean coast have undergone significant ecological changes in recent decades, caused primarily by the introduction of alien species, fishing and the warming of the waters. Here we used a food-web model representing the continental shelf of the Israeli Mediterranean coast to explore the historical dynamics of the area considering the combined effect of alien species, fishing activities and changes in sea surface temperature and primary productivity. The food-web model was fitted to available time series of data from the early 1990s to 2010 using the temporal dynamic module of the Ecopath with Ecosim modeling approach. An important challenge was to model the numerous alien species inhabiting the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, one of the most invaded marine ecosystems of the world. Historical model simulations satisfactorily matched observed data, especially regarding alien groups. However, lack of data from the pelagic environment limited our ability to compare model output with historical observations. Trophic interactions, climate change and fishing were important factors explaining the historical dynamics of the ecosystem, which showed a degradation pattern over time. Results also highlighted an increasing proportion of alien species in biomass and catch over time, with important effects on the food web. This study represents an important step forward in understanding the changes that are occurring in the Israeli continental shelf ecosystem and the Levantine Sea. © Inter-Research 2017.","Alien species; Climate change; Cumulative impacts; Eastern Mediterranean Sea; Ecopath with Ecosim; Fishing impact; Food-web model","climate change; continental shelf; environmental disturbance; food web; hindcasting; human activity; introduced species; pelagic environment; primary production; sea surface temperature; time series; tritrophic interaction; Israel; Levantine Sea; Mediterranean Coast [Israel]; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (East)",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030559607

Soil’s unique natural organization forms the foundation of any food–water–energy nexus system. It forms a habitat for billions of diverse micro, meso, and macrofauna and flora and is the basis of numerous ecosystem services essential to human well-being and nature conservancy. It moderates soil hydrological processes within the entire vadose zone: which is part of the earth between the soil surface and the phreatic zone. Soil structure also supports numerous ecosystem services including nutrient transformation and availability, water quality and renewability, denaturing and transport of pollutants, and groundwater table fluctuations. It also moderates the soil–water–plant-energy nexus with the replenishement of green-water supply (from precipitation) for plants and soil biota, which in turn enables the production of biomass as a source of food, feed, fiber, and biofuel feedstock. Indeed, soil is a very large reservoir for water and carbon with strong influences on local, regional, and global climate. Also, the energy factor is connected with the climate change through soil–water–food–energy nexus because of numerous interlinked pathways including gaseous emissions, energy and food production, and recycling of nutrients and water at regional, national, and global scales. Through provisioning of numerous ecosystem services, the soil–water–food–energy–climate nexus is interwoven with the ecosystem security and functioning of planet’s four ecospheres (i.e., atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and the biosphere). Therefore, the health of soil, plants, animals, people, and ecosystems is one and indivisible. Recent Findings: This interconnectivity is also the basis of the “4 per Thousand” initiative adopted by the COP21, the Climate Summit of 2015 in Paris, and “Adapting African Agriculture” (AAA) by COP22 in Morocco. Consequently, soil is not only a foundation for securing the natural resources: food, water and energy, but it is under desperate need to be integrated and appreciated in understanding the complex interconnectedness of any food, energy, water and soil system. Concentration and stock of soil organic carbon are the key soil properties that determine the physical, chemical, biological, and ecological properties and processes, and are major control of all nexuses described herein. Summary: This chapter presents a conceptual model and the role of soil as a naturally organized medium to protect global food, water, energy securities. Moreover, it elaborates on using soil as a basic nexus tool and proposes a paradigm shift in integrating soil and creating the food–energy–water–soil nexus. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Climate change; Holistic approach; Interconnectivity; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil health; Sustainability","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Ecosystems; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Reservoirs (water); Soils; Water quality; Water recycling; Water supply; Biofuel feedstocks; Ecological property; Ground water table; Nature Conservancy; Nutrient transformations; Soil organic carbon; Transport of pollutants; Water and energies; Soil pollution",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049691113

Despite many large national and international epidemics, the landscape epidemiology of RVF remains obscure, particularly with respect to the ecological roles of wildlife reservoirs and surface water features. The current investigation modeled RVF risk throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula as a function of a suite of biotic and abiotic landscape features using machine learning methods. Intermittent wetland, wild Bovidae species richness and sheep density were associated with increased landscape suitability to RVF outbreaks. These results suggest the role of wildlife hosts and distinct hydrogeographic landscapes in RVF virus circulation and subsequent outbreaks may be underestimated.

Nourishing the expected global population of nine billion in the face of fast diminishing land and water resources and looming climate change has tremendous economic, environmental, and social implications. Furthermore, whereas much past work on food security had focused on feeding the world through more staple crop calories, the current emphasis is on nourishing the global population through the provision of a more nutrient-rich diet. Hence the focus on micronutrient deficiencies (so-called 'hidden hunger'), dietary diversity, and the nutrient density of the food supply-all critical components of overall nutritional status. To aid future assessments of 'sustainable nutrition security', we need a new methodology and some novel assessment metrics and tools. Seven metrics are proposed, each based on a combination of multiple indicators, for use in characterizing sustainable nutrition outcomes of food systems: (1) nutrient adequacy of foods and diets; (2) ecosystem stability; (3) food affordability and availability; (4) sociocultural wellbeing; (5) food safety; (6) resilience; and (7) waste and loss reduction. Each of the metrics comprises multiple indicators that are combined to derive an overall score (0-100). The metrics can be combined with simulation models and then deployed by decision-makers and investors to set meaningful goals, track progress, and evaluate the potential impact of targeted food system interventions. The goal is to improve food system sustainability and resilience and to improve human nutrition and health outcomes. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Dietary quality outcomes; Food systems; Metrics; Modeling methodology; Nutrition security; Sustainability outcomes",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055069077

The phytobenthic communities occur in the photic zone, which in the Baltic Sea extends from the water surface down to a 20 m water depth, but in turbid coastal waters only down to 5 m. 3. The type of vegetation is determined by the available substrate, which is a result of geography and geology in combination with currents. Most macroalgae grow attached to hard substrates whereas vascular plants and charophytes grow on sandy or soft (silt and mud) substrates. 4. Generally, the coastal areas of the Baltic Sea consist of mixed substrates with an intermingled vegetation of vascular plants and algae. In the northern Baltic Sea hard substrates dominate in the outer archipelagos, and in the southeastern Baltic Sea sandy and muddy substrates dominate. 5. Luxuriant stands of macrophytes provide food, shelter and spawning habitats for the associated sessile and mobile micro-, meio- and macrofauna, including fish. 6. On an ecosystem-wide scale, the phytobenthic communities vary along the large-scale Baltic Sea gradient. Biomass decreases with lower salinity and colder climate, while the proportion of freshwater species increases. 7. On a local scale, the phytobenthic communities are mainly, directly or indirectly, shaped by water movement (e.g. By the occurrence of sandy beaches and rocky shores) and winter ice cover. Light and substrate availability give rise to typical depth zonation patterns, ending with soft-substrate communities deepest down. 8. On a small scale (patches), phytobenthic community structure and composition is influenced by microhabitat structure and biotic interactions. 9. The phytobenthic communities in the brackish Baltic Sea are more sensitive to disturbance than their marine counterparts due to low diversity, physiological stress and the loss of sexual reproduction when species approach their salinity limit.","Baltic sea gradient; Community structure; Food-web interactions; Habitat-forming macrophytes; Human impacts; Phytobenthic communities; Productivity",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033682132

We also analyzed the socioeconomic factors and environmental problems associated with the use of wildlife, and how these affect food security.

Even small-scale fishing activities, however, are prone to resource depletion and environmental degradation, which can Erode livelihoods in the long run. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify viable and resilient artisanal fisheries, and generate knowledge to support management within the context of a rapidly changing climate. We examined the ecosystem-level consequences of an artisanal kelp fishery (Macrocystis pyrifera), finding small-scale harvest of this highly productive species poses minimal impacts on kelp recovery rates, survival, and biomass dynamics, and abundances of associated commercial and culturally important fish species. These results suggest that small-scale harvest poses minimal trade-offs for the other economic benefits provided by these ecosystems, and their inherent, spiritual, and cultural value to humans. However, we detected a negative impact of warmer seawater temperatures on kelp recovery rates following harvest, indicating that the viability of harvest, even at small scales, may be threatened by future increases in global ocean temperature. This suggests that negative impacts of artisanal fisheries may be more likely to arise in the context of a warming climate, further highlighting the widespread effects of global climate change on coastal fisheries and livelihoods. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","artisanal fishery; climate change; harvest; kelp; Macrocystis pyrifera; seaweed; small-scale fishery","artisanal fishery; climate change; coastal zone; ecosystem dynamics; environmental assessment; environmental degradation; global ocean; human activity; resource scarcity; seaweed culture; trade-off; water temperature; Erode; India; Tamil Nadu; Macrocystis pyrifera; British Columbia; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; fishery; kelp; Macrocystis; population dynamics; British Columbia; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Kelp; Macrocystis; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017137398

Here, we describe the effects of ocean acidification on an upwelling system that already experiences inherently low pH conditions, the California Current. We used an end-to-end ecosystem model (Atlantis), forced by downscaled global climate models and informed by a meta-analysis of the pH sensitivities of local taxa, to investigate the direct and indirect effects of future pH on biomass and fisheries revenues. Our model projects a 0.2-unit drop in pH during the summer upwelling season from 2013 to 2063, which results in wide-ranging magnitudes of effects across guilds and functional groups. The most dramatic direct effects of future pH may be expected on epibenthic invertebrates (crabs, shrimps, benthic grazers, benthic detritivores, bivalves), and strong indirect effects expected on some demersal fish, sharks, and epibenthic invertebrates (Dungeness crab) because they consume species known to be sensitive to changing pH. The model's pelagic community, including marine mammals and seabirds, was much less influenced by future pH. Some functional groups were less affected to changing pH in the model than might be expected from experimental studies in the empirical literature due to high population productivity (e.g., copepods, pteropods). Model results suggest strong effects of reduced pH on nearshore state-managed invertebrate fisheries, but modest effects on the groundfish fishery because individual groundfish species exhibited diverse responses to changing pH. Our results provide a set of projections that generally support and build upon previous findings and set the stage for hypotheses to guide future modeling and experimental analysis on the effects of OA on marine ecosystems and fisheries. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","California Current; climate change; ecosystem model; fisheries; ocean acidification; risk assessment","acidification; biomass; climate change; ecosystem modeling; ecosystem response; experimental study; fishery management; food web; meta-analysis; risk assessment; taxonomy; California Current; Pacific Ocean; Bivalvia; Cancer magister; Chondrichthyes; Copepoda; Decapoda (Crustacea); Invertebrata; Mammalia; Pteropoda; animal; California; ecosystem; fishery; food chain; invertebrate; mammal; meta analysis; pH; sea; Animals; California; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Food Chain; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Invertebrates; Mammals; Oceans and Seas",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010509958

Recent advances in understanding tropical river–floodplain ecosystems suggest that a small set of basic ecological concepts underpins their biophysical characteristics, especially the high levels of productivity, biodiversity and natural resilience. The concepts relate to (1) river-specific flow patterns, (2) processes ‘fuelled’ by a complex of locally generated carbon and nutrients seasonally mixed with carbon and nutrients from floodplains and catchments, (3) seasonal movements of biota facilitated by flood regimes, (4) food webs and overall productivity sustained by hydrological connectivity, (5) fires in the wet/dry tropical floodplains and riparian zones being major consumers of carbon and a key factor in the subsequent redistribution of nutrients, and (6) river–floodplains having inherent resilience to natural variability but only limited resilience to artificial modifications. Understanding these concepts is particularly timely in anticipating the effects of impending development that may affect tropical river–floodplains at the global scale. Australia, a region encompassing some of the last relatively undisturbed tropical riverine landscapes in the world, provides a valuable case study for understanding the productivity, diversity and resilience of tropical river–floodplain systems. However, significant knowledge gaps remain. Despite substantial recent advances in understanding, present knowledge of these highly complex tropical rivers is insufficient to predict many ecological responses to either human-generated or climate-related changes. The major research challenges identified herein (for example, those related to food web structure, nutrient transfers, productivity, connectivity and resilience), if accomplished in the next decade, will offer substantial insights toward assessing and managing ecological changes associated with human alterations to rivers and their catchments. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","biogeochemistry; connectivity; floodplains; fluxes; food webs; nutrients","biodiversity; biogeochemistry; biophysics; biota; climate change; connectivity; floodplain; food web; nutrient dynamics; riparian zone; river system; Australia",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988566299

First, we analyse NBS in relation to similar concepts, and reflect on its relationship to sustainability as an overarching framework. From this, we derive a set of questions to be addressed and propose a general framework for how these might be addressed in NBS projects by funders, researchers, policy-makers and practitioners. We conclude that: (1) NBS need to be developed and discussed in relation to existing concepts to clarify their added value;(2) When considering and implementing NBS, the ‘relabelling’ of related concepts and the misuse of the concept have to be prevented in order to avoid misunderstanding, duplication and unintended consequences;(3) NBS as currently framed by the European Commission provides an opportunity for: a) transdisciplinary research into the design and implementation of solutions based on nature; and b) overcoming a bias towards development alternatives with narrow perspectives that focus on short-term economic gains and effectiveness;(4) The strength of the NBS concept is its integrative, systemic approach which prevents it from becoming just another “green communication tool” that provides justification for a classical model of natural resource exploitation and management measures.To realise their full potential, NBS must be developed by including the experience of all relevant stakeholders such that ‘solutions’ contribute to achieving all dimensions of sustainability. As NBS are developed, we must also moderate the expectations placed on them since the precedent provided by other initiatives whose aim was to manage nature sustainably demonstrates that we should not expect NBS to be cheap and easy, at least not in the short-term. © 2016 British Geological Survey, NERC","Ecosystem management; Ecosystem services; Environmental governance; Sustainability","biodiversity; catchment; climate change; economic development; ecosystem restoration; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; food security; human; natural resource; Nature Based Solutions; nonhuman; Note; priority journal; risk reduction; vegetation; water management; water quality; ecology; ecosystem; Europe; procedures; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Ecosystem; Environmental Policy; Europe; Ecosystems; Research and development management; Design and implementations; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem services; Environmental governances; European Commission; Green communications; Management measures; Unintended consequences; Sustainable development",Note,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028241470

It also plays a key role in the climate system, and the development and persistence of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and heatwaves. However, sparse and uneven observations have made it difficult to quantify the global distribution and dynamics of surface soil moisture. Here we introduce a metric of soil moisture memory and use a full year of global observations from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive mission to show that surface soil moisture - a storage believed to make up less than 0.001% of the global freshwater budget by volume, and equivalent to an, on average, 8-mm thin layer of water covering all land surfaces - plays a significant role in the water cycle. Specifically, we find that surface soil moisture retains a median 14% of precipitation falling on land after three days. Furthermore, the retained fraction of the surface soil moisture storage after three days is highest over arid regions, and in regions where drainage to groundwater storage is lowest. We conclude that lower groundwater storage in these regions is due not only to lower precipitation, but also to the complex partitioning of the water cycle by the surface soil moisture storage layer at the land surface. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Climate change impacts in Himalayan region have its implications on food production, natural ecosystems, retreat of glacier, water supply, human and animal health and overall human well being.

Understanding the effects these pressures may have is necessary to designing land management strategies that ensure food security, ecosystem service provision and successful climate mitigation and adaptation. However, the number of complex, interacting effects involved makes any complete understanding very difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, the recent development of integrated modelling frameworks allows for the exploration of the co-development of human and natural systems under scenarios of global change, potentially illuminating the main drivers and processes in future land system change. Here, we use one such integrated modelling framework (the CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment Platform) to investigate the range of projected outcomes in the European land system across climatic and socio-economic scenarios for the 2050s. We find substantial consistency in locations and types of change even under the most divergent conditions, with results suggesting that climate change alone will lead to a contraction in the agricultural and forest area within Europe, particularly in southern Europe. This is partly offset by the introduction of socioeconomic changes that change both the demand for agricultural production, through changing food demand and net imports, and the efficiency of agricultural production. Simulated extensification and abandonment in the Mediterranean region is driven by future decreases in the relative profitability of the agricultural sector in southern Europe, owing to decreased productivity as a consequence of increased heat and drought stress and reduced irrigation water availability. The very low likelihood (< 33% probability) that current land use proportions in many parts of Europe will remain unchanged suggests that future policy should seek to promote and support the multifunctional role of agriculture and forests in different European regions, rather than focusing on increased productivity as a route to agricultural and forestry viability. © 2016 The Authors","Climate change; Impacts; Integrated assessment; Socio-economic change; Uncertainty","agricultural production; climate change; environmental impact assessment; future prospect; global change; integrated approach; land use change; nature-society relations; socioeconomic status; uncertainty analysis; water availability; Mediterranean Region; Southern Europe",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002825634

The research is thus another instance of a nexus study in which various forms of research-derived and other knowledge are combined to evaluate and improve policy and other decision-making. The project is shaped by insights on the conduct and evaluation of inter- and transdisciplinary research for policy support reported through the MODSIM and iEMSs conferences in recent years. MAGIC brings together, from multiple centres, expertise in biophysical, computational, economic and social sciences underpinned by theories of transdisciplinary science-for-governance. These MAGIC consortium partners also have experience of treading the fine line between challenging policies (which may be defended by vested interests) and supporting processes of policy reform (whose impetus and legitimacy rely on generating communities of interest). The key challenges for MAGIC are whether this breadth and depth of expertise can be combined in ways that are theoretically rigorous, practical within the resources available and deliver more than the sum of its parts, that is, with discernible impact beyond the science-policy interface (i.e. outwith academia). The integrative core of the project is Quantitative Story Telling (QST), a process of making quality tests of the narratives that underlie or justify key policy positions. The qualities of the policy narratives assessed are their feasibility (within biophysical limits), viability (within the existing institutional context) and desirability (reflecting distributional and acceptability issues); using uses reformulations of existing statistical datasets and simple empirical transformations. The analysis is framed using a societal metabolism metaphor. That is, it focuses on the funds of land and human time needed to create the flows of materials, energy and money that reproduce and maintain the identity of the system of interest (e.g. current patterns and trajectories of consumption). The analysis is conducted simultaneously across scales (geographical or classificatory) to highlight key externalisation effects and dependencies that may undermine long-term security. This quantitative testing of narratives is preceded and shaped by critical choices made by both policy stakeholders and the research team. Which narratives should we focus on? How should we explore these with our social metabolism analysis? Different stakeholders and team members may all have different preferences and epistemological positions. Failure to acknowledge, and where possible resolve, such fundamental differences could limit potential for impact by ensuring that researchers and policy makers have no shared issue framing. For MAGIC, there is thus a strong focus on, and investment in, using social science methods to understand the actors, framing and institutional context within which the QST is conducted and any outputs are used. Deliberative and inclusive processes (undertaking the research in mixed-teams of researchers and stakeholders) are being used to legitimise the process of analysis and ensure that the outputs of QST are salient and credible. The paper concludes by reflecting on how well the expertise developed by the authors in conducting policy support translates from the particular context of Scotland into the structures, processes and procedures of the EU. © 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

Sri Lanka is considered as a vulnerable, small island country that is under serious threat from climate change impacts. The most profound impacts of climate change in Sri Lanka will be on agriculture and food security, water and coastal resources, biodiversity changes, and human health. Sri Lanka’s biodiversity is significantly important both on a regional and global scale as it has the highest species density for flowering plants, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Sri Lanka’s varied ecosystems provide many services that are of significant economic value and play a crucial role in providing goods and ecosystem services. The subsequent sections featuring specific aspects of biodiversity in forests, freshwater wetlands, coastal and marine systems and agricultural systems, provide greater detail on the ecosystem services and bio-resources. Habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive alien species, deforestation and forest degradation, development projects, environmental pollutions and climate change (global warming) are the major threats to the biodiversity of the country. Climate change impacts on environment lead to a reduction in the distribution and abundance of species, especially endemics, which may even result in their global extinction. The introduction of various policies and guidelines in relation to environment is a good sign for conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity. The government of Sri Lanka has been implementing various environmental projects aiming at reducing deforestation and degradation of ecosystems. Policies and measures already developed under such initiatives will no doubt preserve natural habitats for plant and animal species. However, being a developing country with many economic challenges, the funds and expertise available for monitoring climate change impacts and biodiversity conservation are not sufficient. © 2017, Fund for Support and Development of Protected Areas ""Bear Land"".

Climate change impacts, drought, cyclone, floods, and other natural calamities are critical environmental issues receiving much analysis and discussion. The social development, civilization, agricultural cropping patterns, and settlement development are totally dependent on green nature, water availability, and their management. All types of management are dependent on proper policies and good governance. Soil development and fertility improvement are dependent on the water supply and the quality of surface and ground water storage. In cold climatic regions, the last two decades have witnessed growing water stress, both in terms of scarcity and the deterioration of quality. Similar characteristics have appeared in the tropical and subtropical regions. It has estimated that by 2020, the use and reuse is expected to increase by 40%, and 17% more water will be required for food production to meet the needs of the growing population. It is also indicated that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in regions with absolute water scarcity; about two out of three people in the world could be living under water, agriculture, and natural resource stress. The environmental calamities are extending the rush actions; the drought is one of the regular natural calamities seen in different parts of the world as well in Bangladesh and Brazil. The drought impact is a threat for agricultural food production, and less food production is a result of food and nutritional insecurity. Therefore, sustainable use of agricultural practices, which would also embrace the water, soil, forest, air, oil, gas, and petroleum mining sectors, needs to be considered within a strategic 522management approach regarding food production. The above mentioned approaches are probable factors in the management of urban and rural regions for the protection of landscapes and ecosystems as well as agricultural food production. Primary evaluation indicates that, for an increased utilization of natural resources, which are continuously happening in all over the world, as a result that could be a threat for future food security and the sustainability of natural resources.

The provisioning of ecosystem services is a function of the seasonal nature of the climate in northern Ghana. Natural infrastructure enables food provision, which translates into food security and generates income through the year while providing an important safety net during the dry season. Rainfall is concentrated in the period from May to September followed by a long dry season. The river, responding to the climate, shows similar seasonality, flooding large parts of land during the rainy season and drying up during the dry season. Natural water infrastructure supporting riparian communities, such as headwater catchments, wetlands and seasonal floodplains, is affected by water resource development decisions. This study investigated the dependence of three riparian communities on ecosystem services in northern Ghana. In particular, the role of natural water infrastructure in supporting these ecosystem services. Participatory mapping and ranking exercises in gender-segregated groups were used to elicit information on the communities' livelihoods. The riparian communities are dependent on five types of natural infrastructure: forest reserves, shrubs and woodlands, riparian ponds, the White Volta River and floodplains. Different ecosystem services are derived from natural infrastructure and these enable livelihood activities. The most important activities are farming, fishing, livestock watering and grazing, and collection of wild fruits and vegetables, as well as provision of water for domestic use. The major ecosystem service-based activities (agriculture - 95% participation, fishing - 70% and livestock keeping - 87%) are dependent on the seasonal flows of the White Volta River. Floods occur annually between July and September depositing fertile soils on the riverbanks and increasing soil moisture content that supports floodrecession agriculture. The flooding also fills riparian ponds, restocking them with water and fish. Residual moisture in the soils around the ponds enables grass and reed growth, which supports livestock grazing on the floodplains during the dry season and provides raw materials for weaving. During the lean season, at the end of the dry season, when limited income is generated from agriculture, other food and income sources support the communities. The protected forest and the woodlands that are not directly dependent on the river flow provide biomass for energy (firewood or charcoal for direct consumption or selling) as well as wild foods (shea nuts and dawadawa fruit) that contribute to the communities' coping strategy during the lean season. The traditional fishing regime of the ponds is managed in a way that ensures maximum income is generated from fishing at a crucial time of the year. Fishing is restricted until the end of the dry season, ensuring that fish grow to a reasonable size. The fish are then caught by both male and female members of the communities. Provision of ecosystem services is under pressure due to climatic and other anthropogenic changes. For example, delays in the start of the rainy season are affecting rainfed agricultural activities on the floodplains. Delayed planting on the floodplains results in damage to, or loss of, crops as floods arrive before the harvest. Unsustainable natural resource management, related to over-abstraction of resources from the forests, shrubs and woodlands, reduces ecosystem service provision in the long run. Moreover, the Bagré Dam in Burkina Faso, built upstream of the communities, has impacted the natural river flow both positively and negatively for the communities. It currently provides dryseason flow, which is used by the communities for dry-season irrigation and for domestic purposes when other sources of water (boreholes) have dried up. However, in the past, the Bagré Dam has been forced to release emergency spills for dam safety reasons at the end of the wet season. This has washed out crops and caused loss of human lives in downstream Ghana. The planned Pwalugu Dam (with a larger storage capacity than the Bagré Dam) may, depending on the final operations, increase baseflow and also affect the flooding regime of the White Volta River, potentially reducing flood-dependent ecosystem services. We, therefore, recommend that operations of the Pwalugu Dam should take into consideration releasing sufficiently large flood flows that support ecosystem services while minimizing the release of large damaging floods. © 2012, by IWMI.",,"Catchments; Charcoal; Crops; Dams; Drought; Ecosystems; Fish; Fisheries; Fishing (oil wells); Floods; Food supply; Forestry; Fruits; Irrigation; Lakes; Meats; Natural resources management; Ponds; Soil moisture; Stream flow; Agricultural activities; Anthropogenic changes; Coping strategies; Dry-season irrigations; Ecosystem services; Headwater catchment; Natural resource management; Resource development; Rivers",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051586127

In 2009 Professor John Beddington, then the UK government’s chief scientific advisor, brought these issues to public attention by talking of a ‘perfect storm’ resulting from shortages of food, energy and water. Professor Beddington predicted that this storm would arise in 2030, based on data suggesting that global population would rise by 33 per cent, demand for water by 30 per cent and demand for food and energy by 50 per cent. It is both a challenge and a privilege for botanic gardens to be in a position to support scientific research that aims to mitigate some of these problems. Our aim in this chapter is to provide insight into how the maintenance, development and use of a living collection of diverse plant species can help in the development of solutions to some of the major problems facing the world in the twenty-first century. To tackle this question, we set out two key global challenges, those of global food security and global fuel security, and discuss the collection-driven research-oriented roles that botanic gardens can play in their solutions. Global Food Security For the last few years there has been a growing recognition that many of the solutions to the problems the world faces in feeding an ever-growing human population will lie in plant science. Global food security is thought to be at risk as a result of a combination of trends, including increases in population size and wealth, reductions in improvement in crop yields, the impact of climate change on land availability, and conflicts with demands to set land aside either to produce biofuels or to maintain biodiversity and store carbon. The world’s population continues to grow in size, demanding more food. The human population reached 6 billion in 2000, 7 billion in 2015, and is predicted to hit 8 billion by 2025 and 9-9.5 billion by 2050, after which population growth is expected to level off to some extent (UCSB, 2015). © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047973918

The forum was a parallel event to the IUCN World Parks Congress on protected areas, also held in Sydney in the week following the forum. One outcome of the IUCN Congress was the inspirational statement entitled 'Promise of Sydney', which included a call to invest ""in nature's solutions, supported by public policy, incentives, tools and safeguards that help to halt biodiversity loss, mitigate and respond to climate change, reduce the risk and impact of disasters, improve food and water security, and promote human health and dignity"". The papers and plenary discussions in this RZS NSW forum all foreshadowed this vision as it applies to protected areas. Our focus in this theme edition of Australian Zoologist is on conserving fauna in Australia, and in protected areas in particular.

Climate change results in erratic events such as rising global temperature, intensified drought, flooding, cyclones, low or poor agricultural productivity, loss of biodiversity and shifting of seasons. Natural processes such as variations in the intensity of the sun, eruptions from volcanoes, very slow changes in ocean circulations and land surfaces can cause this global climate change but human activities are by far the major causes through the continuous release of greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere, by altering land surfaces, and or depleting the ozone layer. The most environmentally conservative response to climate change mitigation would be to stop the consumption of fossil fuels and production of methane and chlorofluorocarbons; but these options may not be feasible until alternative technologies emanate. Considering the large amounts of carbon accumulated as biomass in plantations, extensive planting of trees, which posses large canopies that are able to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, could help mitigate the rising atmospheric CO2 levels. The roles of plantations in mitigating global climate change are related, but not limited to the following: the influence of trees on the hydrologic cycle, the barrier against destructive windstorm and desertification, conservation of the soil surface against erosion and intense heat, binding action of the dense root system, sustainable biodiversity, provision of renewable and bioenergy, nutritious food, employment, and rural income, and the reservoir of sequestered carbon. There is an urgent need to properly integrate trees and plantations in our agricultural systems, homes, institutions, markets, parks and other public places. This would not only help to reduce the build-up of carbondioxide and other atmospheric impurities but also increase the produce from plantation crops in a locality thereby mitigating against food insecurity and poverty.","Adaptation; Carbon sequestration; Climate-change; Food security, sustainable agriculture; Mitigation; Trees",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034958301

Human rights to water, as water is becoming a commodity threatens the poor. Global water crisis in term of quantity and quality is a man-made disaster linked to environmental imbalance and degradation of the life-support ecosystem. It is a crisis of water management, fragmented institutions, inadequate policies and legal systems, lack of political will, and a widening gap between science and policy making at the national, regional and global levels. Already one third of the world population is living in water-scarce or water-short areas. Climate change will accelerate the figure to one-half. 12% of the world’s population uses 85% of its fresh water. And water supply resources are being stretched to their limits. By 2050 an additional three billion people will be born mostly in countries already suffering from water shortage. According to the IPCC-Nov 2014 report, the world’s electricity must be produced from zero carbon sources by 2050; otherwise, our planet faces irreversible damage. The report says renewables have to grow from 30% share of the power sector to 80%. And all fossil fuel generation without carbon capture and storage (CCS) has to be phased out by 2100. Global warming is unequivocally linked to human interference in the ecosystem, causing glaciers to melt on the polar ice caps resulting in the rise of sea level flooding of agricultural coastal areas. The Nile delta, which is the food basket of Egypt housing 46 million people, may disappear. Coastal fresh water aquifers may be flooded by seeping seawater threatening food security of many large regions of the world. With the advent of climate change, most of water stressed areas particularly in arid and semi-arid zones (Middle East and MENA regions) will face a rainfall decline of 20% and a temperature rise of 2-3 °C that would result in large losses of water resources, basic food, basic needs, and increased poverty. Water science is a “must” in developing a unique water management scheme. It contributes to well-defined policies for efficiency, sound strategy and sustainable plans of action. There is unlimited potential with what science can do on our planet, where salt water and fresh water comprise 97.5% and 2.5% of planet waters, respectively. With 70% of waters tied in polar caps, only 30% is left in rivers, lakes and ground waters to humanity. Food production accounts for 70% of water used in the world. Through the efficient use of water by renewables for desalination, recycling water for agriculture, using new cultivars under stress of low level of waters and brackish waters and genomes resistant to pests and droughts etc., have to intrigue scientists in our part of the world to find a lasting solution to the challenging problem. Fundamental change in water policies and engaging science to develop a unique water management scheme is imperative. Currently, water policies are divorced from sound science. Demands should be managed by a new culture of efficiency, cutting losses, and protecting water from overuse and pollution. There is no doubt that the Climate change and Water - Energy - Food security Nexus in the Arab Middle East, is becoming more complex due to rapid population growth and growing demands by industrial and agricultural developments. Therefore, science becomes crucial in providing the basis for sound governance and a holistic approach enlightened policy linked to energy and water management for sound food security.

Farmers are under pressure to the changing weather and increasing unpredictable water supply. Because of rainfall deficiencies, artificial application of water has been made through irrigation. Irrigation is a basic determinant of agriculture because its inadequacies are the most powerful constraints on the increase of agricultural production. Irrigation networks are permanent and temporary conduits that supply water to agricultural areas from an irrigation source. Detection of irrigation networks using LiDAR DTM, and flood susceptible assessment of irrigation networks could give baseline information on the development and management of sustainable agriculture. Map Gully Depth (MGD) in Whitebox GAT was used to generate the potential irrigation networks. The extracted MGD was overlaid in ArcGIS as guide in the digitization of potential irrigation networks. A flood hazard map was also used to identify the flood susceptible irrigation networks in the study area. The study was assessed through field validation of points which were generated using random sampling method. Results of the study showed that most of the detected irrigation networks have low to moderate susceptibility to flooding while the rest have high susceptibility to flooding which is due to shifting weather.

These challenges are deeply intertwined with global processes, such as climate change and with local events such as natural disasters. The EU's research & innovation (R&I) policy is now seeking to address these challenges from a new perspective, with Nature-Based Solutions, and turn them into innovation opportunities that optimise the synergies between nature, society and the economy. Nature-Based Solutions can be an opportunity for innovation, and are here promoted by both policymakers and practitioners as a cost-effective way of creating a greener, more sustainable, and more competitive economy. Since 2013, the European Commission has devoted particular attention to Nature-Based Solutions through consultations and dialogues that sought to make the concept of these solutions more concrete and to define the concept's place within the spectrum of ecosystem-based approaches. In 2014, the Commission launched an expert group, which conducted further analysis, and made recommendations to help increase the use of Nature-Based Solutions and bring nature back into cities. In 2015, a survey was conducted on citizens' views and perceptions of 'Nature in Cities' to provide further insight for future work. Based on these elements and on results from running EU projects, the Commission has developed an R&I agenda for Nature-Based Solutions and has published targeted calls for proposals for large-scale demonstration projects in this field in 2016 and 2017. Additional R&I actions at EU level that promote systemic Nature-Based Solutions and their benefits to cities and territories are planned with the aim to improve the implementation capacity and evidence base for deploying Nature-Based Solutions and developing corresponding future markets. They are also expected to foster an interdisciplinary R&I and stakeholder community and the exchange of good practices in this field, as well as help shaping and implementing international R&I agendas on Nature-Based Solutions. © 2017","Climate-change adaptation and mitigation; Disaster risk reduction; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem-based approaches; EU Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation; Green infrastructure; Horizon 2020; Innovating with nature; Nature-Based Solutions; Resilient societies; Sustainable development","adaptive management; climate change; cost analysis; disaster management; ecosystem approach; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem service; environmental factor; European Commission; European Union; future prospect; innovation; mitigation; risk assessment; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; sustainable development; Article; economic aspect; ecosystem; environment; environmental policy; Europe; natural science; practice guideline; priority journal; risk reduction; social aspect; urban area; water retention; water supply; city; environment; environmental protection; European Union; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; European Union",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028751508

The forest trees are renewable sources of wood, timber, food, fodder, fuel, and other valuable non-timber products, and due to increase in population and the ardent desire of human being for survival, there has been a constant reduction in forest from the earth’s surface. The current scenario of global climate change threatens to hamper the agro-ecosystems by drastically affecting the key components of environment such as temperature, pattern of rainfall, drought, and water logging. These changes not only affect productivity but are also responsible for decline in the quality of fruits, and litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is one of them. Several conventional approaches have been exploited in the past for the promulgation and improvement of litchi. However, such efforts are confronted with several natural drawbacks and need extensive research to solve the challenges. The application of biotechnological tools for in vitro regeneration, micropropagation, and genetic engineering in litchi species has been applied with success, especially in the last decade, and by the help of genetic engineering technology, it has become possible to introduce desired genes in a much simpler way in litchi.

However, a significant population worldwide presently suffers from malnutrition and inadequate access to food. To meet the goal of zero hunger and malnutrition, agricultural production must maintain pace with increasing food demand. This goal is being challenged by rapidly changing socio-economic and environmental issues. Climate change, depleting soil and water resources, air, water and soil pollution are not only reducing productivity, but also pose a threat to food safety and nutrition. This book analyzes linkages between agriculture and environmental changes, major challenges and potential solutions to secure future food security. It covers, in detail, the impacts of major environmental changes including climate change and air pollution on crops and agricultural production. The potential solutions to address these challenges are also discussed. This book provides the reader with a broad view of interactions between agriculture and the environment, where agriculture is not only vulnerable but also acts as a contributor and offers mitigation options for some of the challenges in sustaining future food security. Agricultural sustainability in near and long-term future will depend on adapting crops and crop management practices based on emerging scientific knowledge of plant physiology and resource efficient technologies combined with focused socio-economic reforms to conserve food diversity and traditional practices. With the help of specific case studies, this book also highlights the significance of reforming small scale farming practices. Overall, this book provides the core idea of sustainable agriculture and food production in current and future scenarios, and is recommended for anyone interested in this topic. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Accordingly, this article critically reviews several focus areas where environmental engineering should assume a more active presence in the global community that seeks to achieve sustainability in developing regions of the world. The 10 environmental engineering Grand Challenges for the developing world covered are: (1) understand the historical perspective of the discipline's connection with public health as the field transitions forward; (2) integrate the differences encountered when operating over rural to urban locations; (3) address emissions of greenhouse gases and other important carbon-containing pollutants; (4) understand the link between development and health to better connect health outcomes and reduction in risk with ecosystem management and other development interventions; (5) address the complex interactions of water energy systems; (6) integrate the synergy inherent in development/sustainability goals of WASH, food security, and resource recovery; (7) transition to a green economy; (8) advance monitoring, evaluation, and assessment activities that include life cycle assessment, (9) integrate culture, perception, and behavior with advances in science and technology, and (10) educate globally competent engineers.

Discussions about the future needs for food, water, and energy to support the increasing world population have ignored our soil resource that is the cornerstone or our capacity to produce food, capture water, and generate energy from biological systems. Soil scientists often recognize soils as a critical component of food, energy, or water security; however, the translation of that awareness into action strategies to either enhance public recognition of soil resource importance or improve soil management is lacking. Food, water, and energy security represents the current and future challenge of sustaining humankind while protecting the environment. These interactions are recognized by scientists, but the linkage to policy decisions or implementation of strategies to create positive outcomes for food, energy, or water enhancement is lacking. If we consider that soil is responsible for 99% of the world's food production, then the importance of soil in the food, energy, water nexus becomes apparent. If we further consider that soil erosion is the major factor, affecting soil degradation and declines in productivity are directly related to degradation of the soil resource, then the implications of soil in the context of increasing food, energy, and water security becomes more evident. However, if the attitude is one that technology will provide answers to these problems, then the soil degradation rate will continue to increase and we will reach a tipping point in which technological advances will not be able to overcome the impacts of a reduced topsoil depth coupled with a more variable climate. Soil is the forgotten piece of the food, energy, water nexus; however, the oversight extends beyond this nexus to include many of the ecological services required by humankind. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change; Crop productivity; Ecosystem services; Nutrient cycling; Soil carbon; Soil degradation; Soil erosion; Soil functions; Water availability; Water use efficiency",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017615317

The effects of rising temperature include soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land, desertification, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, reduced fresh-water resources, acidification of the oceans, and the disruption and depletion of stratospheric ozone. All these have an impact on human health, causing non-communicable diseases such as injuries during natural disasters, malnutrition during famine, and increased mortality during heat waves due to complications in chronically ill patients. Direct exposure to natural disasters has also an impact on mental health and, although too complex to be quantified, a link has even been established between climate and civil violence. Over time, climate change can reduce agricultural resources through reduced availability of water, alterations and shrinking arable land, increased pollution, accumulation of toxic substances in the food chain, and creation of habitats suitable to the transmission of human and animal pathogens. People living in low-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Climate change scenarios include a change in distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with weather extreme events. After floods, increased cases of leptospirosis, campylobacter infections and cryptosporidiosis are reported. Global warming affects water heating, rising the transmission of water-borne pathogens. Pathogens transmitted by vectors are particularly sensitive to climate change because they spend a good part of their life cycle in a cold-blooded host invertebrate whose temperature is similar to the environment. A warmer climate presents more favorable conditions for the survival and the completion of the life cycle of the vector, going as far as to speed it up as in the case of mosquitoes. Diseases transmitted by mosquitoes include some of the most widespread worldwide illnesses such as malaria and viral diseases. Tick-borne diseases have increased in the past years in cold regions, because rising temperatures accelerate the cycle of development, the production of eggs, and the density and distribution of the tick population. The areas of presence of ticks and diseases that they can transmit have increased, both in terms of geographical extension than in altitude. In the next years the engagement of the health sector would be working to develop prevention and adaptation programs in order to reduce the costs and burden of climate change. © 2017, NIOC Health Organization.

We developed a set of protocols for monitoring and analyzing ecological and agricultural household parameters within two 10 × 10-km landscapes in Rwanda, including soil fertility, crop yield, water availability, and fuelwood sustainability. Initial results suggest providing households that rely on rainfall for crop irrigation with timely climate information and improved technical inputs pre-harvest could help increase crop productivity in the short term. The value of the monitoring system is discussed as an effective tool for establishing a baseline of ecosystem services and agriculture before further change in land use and climate, identifying limitations in crop production and soil fertility, and evaluating food security, economic development, and environmental sustainability goals set forth by the Rwandan government. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Agriculture; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Forests; Landscape monitoring; Sustainable development","Agriculture; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Economics; Ecosystems; Food supply; Irrigation; Land use; Productivity; Surveys; Sustainable development; Agricultural intensification; Agricultural landscapes; Agricultural productions; Ecosystem services; Environmental sustainability; Forests; Long-term sustainability; Sustainable agricultural; Monitoring; rain; soil; agricultural intensification; climate change; crop production; ecosystem service; environmental monitoring; irrigation; land use change; landscape; rainfall; smallholder; soil fertility; sustainability; sustainable development; agricultural worker; Article; controlled study; crop production; economic development; ecosystem monitoring; environmental sustainability; food security; government; harvest; irrigation (agriculture); land use; landscape; natural resource; Rwanda; satellite imagery; soil fertility; sustainable agriculture; water availability; agriculture; catering service; climate; ecology; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; human; procedures; soil; Rwanda; Agriculture; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Food Supply; Humans; Rwanda; Soil",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003991279

We argue that the Anthropocene may be conceived as an age of generalized upheaval. Human behavior has affected the planet's climate system, altered biogeochemical processes, reduced biodiversity, modified global hydrology, and changed land cover at an unprecedented pace. Closely linked to this is the rapid loss of social stability and clarity of purpose that characterized much of the 20th century. Prominent elements of contemporary social upheaval include rapid urbanization, the unprecedented volume of sudden human displacements, disruptions to public health caused by factors such as the migration of tropical disease, the deepening of inequality around the world, high speed technology innovation and diffusion, the rapid erosion of the built environment, political gridlock, and new threats at every level of security - human, national and existential. Generalized turbulence suggests the need for a new approach to governance, one that focuses on reconciling systems rather than mainly measuring and reporting simple metrics, such as crime and literacy rates. © 2017 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

The fragile environment poses a threat to ecological safety and sustainable development on the LP and neighboring areas. The ecosystem on the LP has undergone great changes in recent decades owing to dramatic climate change, ecological rehabilitation, and tremendous human pressure. This study was focused on quantifying and assessing the multiple ecosystem services from 2000 to 2012, based on actual observation records and widely used biophysical models. These included Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWSQ), Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA), and rainfall storage method. Furthermore, in this study, the roles of climate variability and an ecological restoration program on vegetation activity and ecosystem services were investigated, as well as the synergies between multiple ecosystem services. The slight increase in both precipitation and temperature during 2000–2012, in conjunction with ecological rehabilitation, induced a trend of increasing in vegetation cover and productivity. During 2000–2012, the overall soil retention function was slightly enhanced while the amount of hydrological regulation decreased. The biomass production (vegetation carbon sequestration) and food production increased sharply. The increasing precipitation intensified water erosion by enhancing rainfall erosivity, whereas the reduction in wind speed lessened wind erosion and thereby reduced the frequency and duration of sandstorm events. Vegetation restoration supported by climate variability and resulting from ecological projects also played positive roles in soil retention enhancement. The spatial correlation analyses indicated synergies between multiple regulating ecosystem services. There was also a synergy between food production and carbon sequestration in vegetation. The performance of ecological rehabilitation and changes in ecosystem services on the LP exemplified the need for ecological conservation to take climate variability into account, and to facilitate synergies involving multiple ecosystem services, to maximize human well-being and preserve natural ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","China; Climate variability; Ecological rehabilitation; Ecosystem service; Loess plateau (LP); Synergy","Climate change; Climatology; Ecology; Erosion; Forestry; Landforms; Mergers and acquisitions; Precipitation (meteorology); Rain; Restoration; Sediment transport; Sediments; Soils; Storms; Sustainable development; Vegetation; Wind; China; Climate variability; Ecological rehabilitation; Ecosystem services; Loess Plateau; Synergy; Ecosystems; anthropogenic effect; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation status; ecoregion; ecosystem service; environmental protection; food production; precipitation (climatology); restoration ecology; sustainable development; synergism; vegetation cover; wind erosion; wind velocity; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991711425

Hundreds of millions of people around the world benefit from low-cost protein, recreation, and commerce provided by freshwater fisheries, particularly in regions where alternative sources of nutrition and employment are scarce. Here, we derive a gridded global map of riverine fisheries and assess its implications for biodiversity conservation, fishery sustainability, and food security. Catches increase with river discharge and human population density, and 90% of global catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. Fish richness and catches are positively but not causally correlated, revealing that fishing pressure is most intense in rivers where potential impacts on biodiversity are highest. Merging our catch analysis with nutritional and socioeconomic data, we find that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people. Poor and undernourished populations are particularly reliant on inland fisheries compared with marine or aquaculture sources. The spatial coincidence of productive freshwater fisheries and low food security highlights the critical role of rivers and lakes in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. At the same time, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our enhanced spatial data on estimated catches can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity.","Ecosystem services; Fish diversity; Fishing pressure; Rivers; Subsistence fishery","fresh water; Article; body size; climate change; conservation biology; fishery management; fishing; floodplain; food security; freshwater fish; global climate; human; lake; nonhuman; nutrient availability; population density; priority journal; protein intake; river; river basin; river ecosystem; seasonal variation; species composition; species richness; stress; water temperature; watershed",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994506086

Soil organic carbon (SOC) strongly impacts soil quality, functionality and health. Terms soil quality and soil health should not be used interchangeable. Soil quality is related to what it does (functions), whereas soil health treats soil as a living biological entity that affects plant health. Through plant growth, soil health is also connected with the health of animals, humans, and ecosystems within its domain. Through supply of macro- and micronutrients, soil health, mediated by SOC dynamics is a strong determinant of global food and nutritional security. Soil C pool consists of two related but distinct components: SOC and soil inorganic C (SIC). The SIC pool comprises of primary and secondary carbonates, and the latter consists of calcitic (no net sequestration of atmospheric CO2) and silicatic (net sequestration). While SOC is highly dynamic, its mean residence time depends on the degree of protection (physical, chemical, biological, and ecological) within the soil matrix. Formation of stable microaggregates and of organo-mineral complexes can protect SOC against microbial processes for millennia. In addition to formation of silicatic type of secondary carbonates, leaching of bicarbonates into the subsoil or shallow water table is also an important mechanism of sequestration of CO2 as SIC. Numerous soil functions and ecosystem services depend on SOC and its dynamics. Improvements in soil health, along with increase in availability of water and nutrients, increases soil's resilience against extreme climate events (e.g., drought, heat wave) and imparts disease-suppressive attributes.

Restoration of forests within landscapes offers multiple social, economic, and environmental benefits that enhance lives of local people, mitigate effects of climate change, increase food security, and safeguard soil and water resources. Despite rapidly growing knowledge regarding the extent and feasibility of natural regeneration and the environmental and economic benefits of naturally regenerating forests in the tropics, tree planting remains the major focus of restoration programs. Natural regeneration is often ignored as a viable land-use option. Here, we assemble a set of 16 original papers that provide an overview of the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of forest and landscape restoration (FLR), a relatively new approach to forest restoration that aims to regain ecological integrity and enhance human well-being in deforested or degraded forest landscapes. The papers describe how spontaneous (passive) and assisted natural regeneration can contribute to achieving multiple social and ecological benefits. Forest and landscape restoration is centered on the people who live and work in the landscape and whose livelihoods will benefit and diversify through restoration activities inside and outside of farms. Given the scale of degraded forestland and the need to mitigate climate change and meet human development needs in the tropics, harnessing the potential of natural regeneration will play an essential role in achieving the ambitious goals that motivate global restoration initiatives. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","ecosystem services; forest and landscape restoration; mosaic restoration; spontaneous natural regeneration; sustainable land use; wide-scale restoration","climate change; deforestation; ecosystem service; environmental restoration; global change; habitat mosaic; land use change; livelihood; long-term change; reforestation; regeneration; sustainable development; tree planting; tropical environment",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995961478

The region also has extreme gradients in mercury (Hg) contamination due to a broad distribution of inorganic Hg sources. These diverse Hg sources and a varied landscape create a unique and complex mosaic of ecological risk from Hg impairment associated with differential methylmercury (MeHg) production and bioaccumulation. Understanding the landscape-scale variation in the magnitude and relative importance of processes associated with Hg transport, methylation, and MeHg bioaccumulation requires a multidisciplinary synthesis that transcends small-scale variability. The Western North America Mercury Synthesis compiled, analyzed, and interpreted spatial and temporal patterns and drivers of Hg and MeHg in air, soil, vegetation, sediments, fish, and wildlife across western North America. This collaboration evaluated the potential risk from Hg to fish, and wildlife health, human exposure, and examined resource management activities that influenced the risk of Hg contamination. This paper integrates the key information presented across the individual papers that comprise the synthesis. The compiled information indicates that Hg contamination is widespread, but heterogeneous, across western North America. The storage and transport of inorganic Hg across landscape gradients are largely regulated by climate and land-cover factors such as plant productivity and precipitation. Importantly, there was a striking lack of concordance between pools and sources of inorganic Hg, and MeHg in aquatic food webs. Additionally, water management had a widespread influence on MeHg bioaccumulation in aquatic ecosystems, whereas mining impacts where relatively localized. These results highlight the decoupling of inorganic Hg sources with MeHg production and bioaccumulation. Together the findings indicate that developing efforts to control MeHg production in the West may be particularly beneficial for reducing food web exposure instead of efforts to simply control inorganic Hg sources. © 2016","Atmospheric deposition; Bigeochemistry; Bioaccumulation; Birds; Landscape; Legacy mining; Methylmercury exposure; Risk","Alkylation; Animals; Aquatic ecosystems; Biochemistry; Birds; Contamination; Ecology; Ecosystems; Fish; Health risks; Human resource management; Mercury (metal); Meteorological problems; Plants (botany); Risks; Water management; Atmospheric depositions; Bigeochemistry; Environmental contamination; Landscape; Methyl mercury; Resource management; Small scale variability; Spatial and temporal patterns; Bioaccumulation; methylmercury; mercury; methylmercury derivative; atmospheric deposition; bioaccumulation; biogeochemistry; bird; fish; mercury (element); mining; pollution exposure; risk assessment; air pollution; Article; bioaccumulation; biogeochemistry; environmental exposure; environmental stress; fish; food web; habitat use; health hazard; human; land use; mining; nonhuman; North America; pollution transport; precipitation; priority journal; risk factor; soil pollution; water management; wildlife; analysis; animal; Canada; environmental monitoring; metabolism; Mexico; pollutant; United States; vertebrate; North America; Aves; Animals; Canada; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fishes; Mercury; Methylmercury Compounds; Mexico; United States; Vertebrates",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989791987

These contributions have focused on providing clean water and air as well as managing waste streams and remediating polluted sites. As environmental problems have become more global in scale and more deeply entrenched in sociotechnical systems, the discipline of environmental engineering must grow to be ready to respond to the challenges of the coming decades. Here we make the case that environmental engineers should play a leadership role in the development of climate change mitigation technologies at the carbon-water nexus (CWN). Climate change, driven largely by unfettered emissions of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, is a far-reaching and enormously complex environmental risk with the potential to negatively affect food security, human health, infrastructure, and other systems. Solving this problem will require a massive mobilization of existing and innovative new technology. The environmental engineering community is uniquely positioned to do pioneering work at the CWN using a skillset that has been honed, solving related problems. The focus of this special issue, on ""The science and innovation of emerging subsurface energy technologies,"" provides one example domain within which environmental engineers and related disciplines are beginning to make important contributions at the CWN. In this article, we define the CWN and describe how environmental engineers can bring their considerable expertise to bear in this area.

Yet fresh produce agrifood systems are diverse and under constraints for more sustainability. We analyze how measures taken to guarantee safety interact with other objectives for sustainability, in light of the diversity of fresh produce agrifood systems. The review is based on the publications at the interface between fresh produce safety and sustainability, with sustainability defined by low environmental impacts, food and nutrition security and healthy life. The paths for more sustainable fresh produce are diverse. They include an increased use of ecosystem services to e.g. favor predators of pests, or to reduce impact of floods, to reduce soil erosion, or to purify run-off waters. In contrast, they also include production systems isolated from the environment. From a socio-economical view, sustainability may imply maintaining small tenures with a higher risk of pathogen contamination. We analyzed the consequences for produce safety by focusing on risks of contamination by water, soil, environment and live stocks. Climate change may increase the constraints and recent knowledge on interactions between produce and human pathogens may bring new solutions. Existing technologies may suffice to resolve some conflicts between ensuring safety of fresh produce and moving towards more sustainability. However, socio-economic constraints of some agri-food systems may prevent their implementation. In addition, current strategies to preserve produce safety are not adapted to systems relying on ecological principles and knowledge is lacking to develop the new risk management approaches that would be needed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Climate change; Foodborne pathogens; Livestock; Organic farming; Waste water; Wildlife","Agriculture; Climate change; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Food safety; Pathogens; Risk management; Safety engineering; Wastewater; Ecological principles; Ecosystem services; Food-borne pathogens; Livestock; Organic farming; Production practice; Production system; Wildlife; Sustainable development; climate change; environmental impact; food production; food safety; food security; livestock farming; organic farming; pathogen; socioeconomic impact; sustainability; trade-off; wastewater; wildlife management; agricultural management; agricultural parameters; biodiversity; climate change; economic aspect; ecosystem; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; food biotechnology; food contamination; food industry; food safety; food security; human; livestock; microbial contamination; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; soil management; sustainable agriculture; water supply; agriculture; environmental protection; food; food control; food safety; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Food; Food Contamination; Food Microbiology; Food Safety",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963976250

Drawing on a systematic review of scientific evidence, combined with information from key informants, stakeholders and a research-industry workshop, we critically assess the impacts of sugarcane development on water, soil and air quality, employment, food security and human health. Our analysis shows that sugarcane production is, in general, neither explicitly good nor bad, sustainable nor unsustainable. The impacts of expansion of sugarcane production on the environment and society depend on the global political economy of sugar, local context, quality of scheme, nature of the production system and farm management. Despite threats from climate change and forthcoming changes in the trade relationship with the European Union, agricultural development policies are driving national and international interest and investment in sugarcane in SSA, with expansion likely to play an important role in sustainable development in the region. Our findings will help guide researchers and policy makers with new insights in understanding the situated environmental and social impacts associated with alternative sugar economy models, production technologies and qualities of management. © 2016 The Authors.","Agriculture; Development; Impact; Livelihoods; Sugar; Water resources","agricultural development; agricultural management; biotransformation; climate change; crop production; demand analysis; European Union; food security; global perspective; investment; market system; policy making; political economy; socioeconomic impact; sugar cane; sustainable development; water resource; Europe; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973154882

This study focused on quantifying and assessing the changes in multiple ecosystem services in the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR), China in 2000-2012. Based on the widely used biophysical models including Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-Offs (InVEST), Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWSQ), and Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) models, this study assessed the historical flow of regulating services, including soil conservation, water yield, and carbon sequestration, and provisioning service food provision. The soil conservation function of ecosystem was slightly enhanced as a whole, and water yield increased sharply, with both the soil conservation and water yield showing an increasing spatial homogenization. The net primary productivity (NPP) and food production increased substantially from 2000 to 2012. Ecosystem services are closely and complexly interlinked. The correlation analyses indicated a trade-off between the water yield and carbon sequestration, however, a synergy between soil conservation and carbon sequestration. Congruence between the three different ecosystem provisioning services, including pasture, meat, and grain, was found. There was also a synergy between food production and ecosystem carbon sequestration in the TRHR. Climatic variability and vegetation restoration are important for the ecosystem services flow. Correlation analyses showed that the increase in precipitation significantly enhanced the water yield (P < 0.01) and soil erosion (P < 0.01), while the temperature increase influenced positively the NPP (P < 0.1). The experience of ecological rehabilitation and the change in key ecosystem services in the TRHR exemplified the positive effects of environmental policies and the necessity of adopting an adaptive management approach. Thus the ecological construction and policy making should take climate variability into account, and facilitate synergies on multiple ecosystem services in order to maximize human well-being and preserve its natural ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate change affects Africa’s water resources, agriculture, biodiversity, human health, and national security. Food and water security are the two major challenges facing Africa whilst have been deteriorated by climate change. This study reviews the new findings of climate change impacts on water system and agriculture in Africa and their limitations, with the attempt to facilitate and promote enhanced researches related to climate change impact and vulnerability. Observation shows that climate change has led to rapid melting of glaciers, reduced rainfall and increased variability. Hydrological simulation demonstrates that further climate change would decrease precipitation and runoff in some areas, worsening current fragile water supply in most of Africa. Africa’s agriculture faces unprecedented challenges under climate change. Both observation and simulation indicate climate change posed negative effects on Africa’s agriculture. Increased risks of drought, changed growth season and decreased crop yield, would likely threat food security in Africa. Uncertainties in these studies mainly come from climate scenarios, methods, quality and quantity of data. Compared to other regions, Africa is short of comprehensive and in-depth researches related to climate change impact and vulnerability, therefore expects substantial investment on such activities to devise effective strategies in mitigating the negative effects of climate change on water resources and agriculture. © 2016 Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology.

Such phenomena are also a cause of concern as cities consume close to three-quarters of the world’s natural resources and generate three-quarters of its pollution and waste. There is a need for the cities to get smarter through the application of innovative solutions to address large-scale urbanisation challenges and find new ways for creating liveable, competitive and self-reliant cities. In this direction, the advent of smart cities could be a much larger wave of transformation which is about to splash the entire world. The precise content, feature and nature of smart cities vary from country to country, depending upon geographical condition, ecosystems, resource availabilities and major challenges being faced. Pilot projects have been taken up in almost all parts of the world to emulate such cities. Many countries have rolled out grand plans for the development of both greenfield and brownfield smart cities. There have been several agitations against such extensive infiltration of information technologies in societies due to the fear of cyberattacks, privacy threats, etc. However, societies have decided to go ahead because of the greater advantages as well as necessity of smarter systems for ensuring a quality life for citizens. The revolution of upcoming smart cities would thus be one of the most holistic movements, which would require extensive participation from almost all fronts of the society, thus resulting in a truly substantive development. Due to enhanced dependency on data sensors, automation technologies, information and communication technologies, software analytical applications, etc., any disruption/disaster may disintegrate the whole string of services and jeopardise the smart city ecosystem. Further, high concentration of population and economic activities make smart cities vulnerable to severe damage in terms of human lives as well as financial breakdown. Therefore, resilient measures for various natural and man-made disasters need to be taken care of. Major portions of all urban areas on earth are coastal/riverside, exposing them to sea/river-level rise and storm surges. Climate impacts such as cyclones, floods and droughts have financial impacts, with major disruption to business operations and city finances. This necessitates that at the onset of the development of smart city, concomitant actions are needed to make them resilient to disaster as well. This article introduces the concept of smart city and discusses its various attributes. Technology span required for smart city development has been analysed and presented. Some of the global initiatives have been discussed, along with the Government of India’s ambitious programme of establishing 100 smart cities on a fast track. The planning and prioritisation strategies necessary for the success and sustainability of such a programme are discussed. To be really intelligent, cities must also consider the impacts of climate change. Therefore, disaster risk reduction is one of the key aspects in smart city development. Accordingly, vulnerabilities associated with smart cities have been listed with a holistic and far-sighted approach. These help in identification of mechanisms, policies and practices to be taken up by all the stakeholders to ensure that the smart cities serve their purpose of socio-economic development and citizen-centric governance, instead of procedural governance, without posing a threat to security, stability and integrity of the individuals and the society as a whole. The article also highlights the need for establishing a central command control centre and the shift in administrative procedures as well as emergency governance structures to accommodate the modern needs of involving citizens extensively in building these cities, not only literally but also figuratively. © 2016 Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA) SAGE Publications.","E-governance; Food; Smart cities; Sustainable development; Waste management; Water",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016111858

Here we identify target values for algal productivity and financing conditions required to achieve a biocrude selling price of $5 per gallon and beneficial environmental impacts. A modeling framework-combining process design, techno-economic analysis, life cycle assessment, and uncertainty analysis-was applied to two conversion pathways: (1) ""fuel only (HTL)"", using hydrothermal liquefaction to produce biocrude, heat and power, and (2) ""fuel and feed"", using wet extraction to produce biocrude and lipid-extracted algae, which can substitute components of animal and aqua feeds. Our results suggest that with supporting policy incentives, the ""fuel and feed"" scenario will likely achieve a biocrude selling price of less than $5 per gallon at a productivity of 39 g/m2/day, versus 47 g/m2/day for the ""fuel only (HTL)"" scenario. Furthermore, if lipid-extracted algae are used to substitute fishmeal, the process has a 50% probability of reaching $5 per gallon with a base case productivity of 23 g/m2/day.

Soil degradation, therefore, poses a threat to food security, as it reduces yield, forces farmers to use more inputs, and may eventually lead to soil abandonment. Unfortunately, the importance of preserving soil health appears to be overlooked by policy makers. In this paper, I first briefly introduce the present situation concerning agricultural production, natural resources, soil degradation, land use and the challenge ahead, to show how these issues are strictly interwoven. Then, I define soil degradation and present a review of its typologies and estimates at a global level. I discuss the importance of preserving soil capital, and its relationship to human civilization and food security. Trends concerning the availability of arable agricultural land, different scenarios, and their limitations, are analyzed and discussed. The possible relation between an increase in a country's GNP, population and future availability of arable land is also analyzed, using the World Bank's database. I argue that because of the many sources of uncertainty in the data, and the high risks at stake, a precautionary approach should be adopted when drawing scenarios. The paper ends with a discussion on the key role of preserving soil organic matter, and the need to adopt more sustainable agricultural practices. I also argue that both our relation with nature and natural resources and our lifestyle need to be reconsidered. © 2016 by the authors.","Agriculture; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Food production; Food security; Land degradation; Organic agriculture; Precautionary approach; Scenario analysis; Soil conservation; Soil degradation",,Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961970457

Some have pointed to technological solutions to reduce vulnerabilities and to build resiliency into food, energy, and water systems (FEWS). While technological advances to upgrade human systems, e.g., in agriculture, urban planning, pollution abatement, and green energy development, are critical, these technical advances are insufficient on their own. Effective FEWS management depends on understanding human decision-making, including adaptations to new environmental, social, or economic changes and the responses of individuals and communities to new technologies intended to improve FEWS resilience and sustainability. This paper draws on multiple social science perspectives, including decision science, economics, and sociology, to consider the fundamental role that human behavior and adaptations play in FEWS. We discuss the importance of accounting for human behavior within a coupled human-natural systems framework in which a range of human adaptations and feedbacks are considered, including how humans might respond directly to press-pulse dynamics and indirectly through their adoption of new technology. Following a brief summary of key concepts of decision-making theory at individual and community scales, we then focus on migration and land use changes, the two types of human adaptations that are particularly important for FEWS modeling and management. The paper concludes with a discussion of key knowledge gaps and research needs in the social sciences related to human adaptations in the context of FEWS. © 2016, AESS.","Behavior and decision-making; Coupled human and natural systems; Land use change; Migration; Resilience","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; ecosystem resilience; energy use; environmental management; food security; human behavior; land use change; natural disaster; population migration; sustainability; technological development; vulnerability; water footprint",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977126588

In this study, an in-depth analysis of ecological resource consumption, atmospheric emissions, land and water footprints of 54 agricultural and food industries in the U.S. were examined extensively. Initially, the supply-chain linked ecological life cycle assessment was performed with Ecologically-based Life Cycle Assessment (Eco-LCA) tool. Then, the results of life cycle inventory were used to assess the mid and end-point impacts by using the ReCiPe approach. Thirdly, ecological performance assessment was performed using well-known metrics, including loading and renewability ratios and eco-efficiency analysis. As a novel comprehensive approach, the integrated framework that consists of the Eco-LCA, ReCiPe and linear programming-based ecological performance assessment is of importance to have an overall understanding about the extent of impacts related to agricultural and food production activities across the U.S. Results indicated that grain farming, dairy food, and animal production-related sectors were found to have the greatest shares in both environmental and ecological impact categories as well as endpoint impacts on human health, ecosystem and resources.

In response to the limitations of previous assessments, a new methodology is proposed here based on the concept of ""sustainable nutrition security"" (SNS). This novel assessment methodology is intended to remedy both kinds of deficiencies in the previous work by defining seven metrics, each based on a combination of multiple indicators, for use in characterizing sustainable nutrition outcomes of food systems: (1) food nutrient adequacy; (2) ecosystem stability; (3) food affordability and availability; (4) sociocultural wellbeing; (5) food safety; (6) resilience; and (7) waste and loss reduction. Each of the metrics comprises multiple indicators that are combined to derive an overall score (0-100).

Not only resource extracting and processing industries, but also forestry and agriculture capitalize these resources with implications for local and global processes of nature and society. We analysed the state of land and water resources with regard to the impacts of human activity and climate change. The environmental status of forests, agricultural lands and inland water bodies was evaluated based on our own research and the recent literature. The focus was on agro-ecosystems. Our synthetic review revealed that peatlands and Tundra ecosystems are endangered by resource-extracting industries and industrial air pollution. Mining and industrial activity damage soil and vegetation and accelerate thermokarst processes. Forest ecosystems suffer increasingly from fires, insect outbreaks and improper management. Past and recent mining and industrial activity has polluted soils and water seriously in many regions. Permafrost melting could expose cases of old and inherited pollution. The impact of agriculture on water quality is still low but will increase. Agriculture is in a recession and operates inefficiently, destroying the soil. There is largely a lack of any agri-environmental monitoring in many regions. The rural infrastructure is on the verge of collapse, in the High North and the Far East in particular. State natural reserves (zapovedniks) are endangered by illegal activities and lack integration into scientific monitoring. Overall, monitoring programmes on the status of land and water resources lack consistency and modern technology. Climate change will put a great deal of additional pressure on Siberian landscapes, but hard data are required, and monitoring systems need to be modernized. Siberian landscapes have great potential for the mitigation of climate change through carbon sequestration and for improving people’s livelihoods. Environmentally friendly business activities such as organic food production, environmental tourism and recreational fishing are still underdeveloped. We conclude that the status of food production and the disintegration of rural areas are risks for Russian food security and national security.

The quantum is gradually rising as a result of increases in aquaculture production. A number of climate-related threats to capture both the fisheries and aquaculture are identified, but we have high uncertainty in predictions of the future fisheries production because of uncertainty over the future global aquatic net primary production and the transfer of this production through the food chain to human consumption. Recent changes in the distribution and productivity of a number of fish species can be ascribed with high confidence to regional climate variability, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. The future production may increase in some high-latitude regions because of warming and decreased ice cover, but the dynamics in low-latitude regions are governed by different processes, and production may decline as a result of reduced vertical mixing of the water column and, hence, reduced recycling of nutrients. There are strong interactions between the effects of fishing and the effects of climate because fishing reduces the age, size and geographic diversity of populations and the biodiversity of marine ecosystems, making both more sensitive to additional stresses such as climate change-induced salinity oscillation. The estuaries in the lower Gangetic delta at the apex of Bay of Bengal are noted for contrasting spatial variation of salinity. The Hooghly estuary in the western sector is relatively low saline compared to the Matla estuary in the central sector on account of receiving the fresh water discharge from the Farakka barrage. The central sector is hyper saline due to siltation of the Bidyadhari River since the late fifteenth century. The present study evaluates the condition factor of fourteen commercially important fin fish species (that constitute ~75 % of the fishes in the catch basket) collected from the Hooghly and Matla estuaries in the western and central sectors of the lower Gangetic delta, respectively. Relatively higher values of condition factor of all the species collected from the Hooghly estuary (compared to those collected from the Matla estuary) confirm the adverse effect of hyper salinity on the growth and condition factor of the species. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Climate change; Condition index; Fin fish; Salinity","Atmospheric pressure; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Estuaries; Fins (heat exchange); Fish; Fisheries; Fishing (oil wells); Saline water; Water recycling; Additional stress; Geographic diversity; High-latitude regions; Human consumption; Net primary production; Southern oscillation; Spatial variations; Strong interaction; Climate change",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077621800

These changes have important implications for agriculture, for human health, and for the conservation of biodiversity in the region. This paper examines the implications of climate-driven changes for native and traditional crops in the municipality of Colomi, Cochabamba, Bolivia. Data were collected between 2012 and 2014 via mixed methods, qualitative fieldwork, including participatory workshops with female farmers and food preparers, semi-structured interviews with local agronomists, and participant observation. Drawing from this data, the paper describes (a) the observed impacts of changing weather patterns on agricultural production in the municipality of Colomi, Bolivia and (b) the role of local environmental resources and conditions, including clean running water, temperature, and humidity, in the household processing techniques used to conserve and sometimes detoxify native crop and animal species, including potato (Solanum sp.), oca (Oxalis tuberosa), tarwi (Lupinus mutabilis), papalisa (Ullucus tuberosus), and charke (llama or sheep jerky). Analysis suggests that the effects of climatic changes on agriculture go beyond reductions in yield, also influencing how farmers make choices about the timing of planting, soil management, and the use and spatial distribution of particular crop varieties. Furthermore, household processing techniques to preserve and detoxify native foods rely on key environmental and climatic resources, which may be vulnerable to climatic shifts. Although these findings are drawn from a single case study, we suggest that Colomi agriculture characterizes larger patterns in what might be termed, ""indigenous food systems."" Such systems are underrepresented in aggregate models of the impacts of climate change on world agriculture and may be under different, more direct, and more immediate threat from climate change. As such, the health of the food production and processing environments in such systems merits immediate attention in research and practice. © 2016 Keleman Saxena, Cadima Fuentes, Gonzales Herbas and Humphries.","Agrobiodiversity; Andean agriculture; Bolivia; Climate change impacts; Food security; Indigenous food systems",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054735450

This ‘semi-desert’ agriculture installed the idea that productive land must be dry, a paradigm that ever since has been applied also to wet, organic soils. We deeply drain peatland to grow arid maize Zea mays in Germany, strongly water-demanding sugar cane Saccharum spp. in Florida and the desert species Aloe vera in Indonesia. Practices like this have made agriculture the main driver of global peatland loss (Joosten and Clarke 2002, Chapter 2) and drained peatlands are thus primarily found in regions that are climatically favourable for agriculture, i.e. in the temperate zone and the (sub)tropics (Chapter 2). Peatland drainage causes inherent peatland degradation, a substantial financial and environmental burden and eventually the loss of the productive value of the peat soil (Joosten, Tapio-Biström and Tol 2012). These problems are increasingly being recognised: worldwide several thousands of square kilometres of drained agricultural peatlands have been rewetted in recent years for climate change mitigation, for biodiversity, or simply because maintaining drainage infrastructure had become too expensive. Rewetting has indeed re-established major regulating and cultural services of wet peatlands, including carbon storage, flood control, water purification, archive function and biodiversity (Theuerkauf et al. 2006; Limpens et al. 2008; Trepel 2010; Tanneberger and Wichtmann 2011; Joosten et al. 2015a; Chapter 6). The provisioning services of these formerly productive lands, however, were mostly lost as the rewetted areas were generally earmarked for nature conservation with the condition that they would no longer be used agriculturally. On the other hand, the quest for productive land is rapidly growing worldwide. This demand will continue to increase, because of the inevitable growth of human population and the justified demands for food security and more welfare. The demand will also grow, because biomass from cultivated land will increasingly have to replace the resources that until now were obtained from the wilderness (wood, non-timber forest products, bushmeat) and the bedrock (coal, oil, gas, minerals). Both the persistent use of drained peatlands for agriculture and the conversion of agriculturally used peatlands to unused wetlands imply that we are losing productive land at a time when we need it most. © British Ecological Society 2016.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048429112

Lack of off-farm employment opportunities combined with limited productive lands has forced the mountain communities to eke out their living through intensive cultivation of crops to fragile mountain slopes. Cropping systems vary considerably with land types, elevation, slope, aspect, seasonal water availability, soil types, and their fertility. Multiple cropping, in combination with several crop rotations are predominant to safeguard food supply and meet dietary requirements of households. Land management practices such as terracing, traditional agro-forestry practices and intercropping are some of the best examples that have been developed by the farmers by their ingenuity to cope with the harsh and fragile mountain ecosystems. The mountain cropping systems have to face numerous natural and human-induced challenges, including land degradation and loss of agro-biodiversity, leading to food insecurity and unsustainable livelihoods. This region is highly vulnerable to environmental degradation and climate change is seen as a risk multiplier. Meeting the ever-growing food demands while sustaining land productivity and maintaining resiliency at the farm level is the major challenge faced by the mountain farmers. This chapter outlines the typical characteristics of the mountain cropping systems and discusses how they are coping with the ongoing natural and socio-economic dynamics. The vulnerability of the fragile mountain agro-ecosystems to climate change and its impacts on land use and cropping systems are discussed. The mountains agriculture seems to be highly vulnerable to climate change effects particularly erratic rainfall events and droughts, and land degradation due to soil erosion, landslides, flash floods, and siltation leading to loss of productive lands, crops failure and food insecurity. Effective measures to cope with such impacts in the mountain agro-ecosystem are suggested. Increased public awareness about the climate change effects, building adaptive capacity to cope with such effects, sustainable soil and water conservation practices, and resilient cropping practices (drought tolerant crop/varieties, change in crop rotations, and water use efficiency) seem to be the key strategies to be adopted to cope with the climate change effects in the fragile mountain agro-ecosystems. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Climate change adaptation; Crop rotations; Cropping systems; Land use; Mountain agro-ecosystem",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030232007

The gritty story of her family’s experience with water rights on its Colorado farm provides essential background about American farms, food, and water administration in the West in the context of growing cities and climate change. Enchanting and informative, The Man Who Thought He Owned Water is an appeal for urban-rural cooperation over water and resiliency. When her father bought his farm-Big Bend Station-he also bought the ample water rights associated with the land and the South Platte River, confident that he had secured the necessary resources for a successful endeavor. Yet water immediately proved fickle, hard to defend, and sometimes dangerous. Eventually those rights were curtailed without compensation. Through her family’s story, d’Elgin dramatically frames the personal-scale implications of water competition, revealing how water deals, infrastructure, transport, and management create economic growth but also sever human connections to Earth’s most vital resource. She shows how water flows to cities at the expense of American-grown food, as rural land turns to desert, wildlife starves, the environment degrades, and climate change intensifies. Depicting deep love, obsession, and breathtaking landscape, The Man Who Thought He Owned Water is an impassioned call to rebalance our relationship with water.

Geographic and socioeconomic characteristics in East Africa (EA) and South America (SA) make the regions among the most vulnerable to the current temperature variations attracting several studies with wider implications. Presently, in these two regions, remarkable evidence of climate change includes repeated droughts and increase in drylands affecting water and food availability for humans, livestock, and wildlife (EA); intensification of climate-sensitive diseases; sea level rise; fast retreat of glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Kenya in Kenya, and Andean Mountains of South America; change in the rainfall patterns in the Amazon forests and in the whole of EA; and increasing of the frequency and intensity of the El Niño and La Niña phenomenon in the South Pacific that affect both EA and SA, among others. Although these two regions are not major contributors of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the poor conservation of strategic ecosystems through deforestation of the Amazon forests in SA and various forests in EA coupled with intensification of agriculture, land degradation, rapid rates of urbanization, and industrialization all driven by rapid population increase are putting a strain on valuable natural resources whose conservation would be critical in mitigating climate change. Adaptation measures have been constrained by climate change impacts. In both regions, poverty is widespread and climate change impacts have jeopardized most poverty alleviation initiatives including realization of some of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Moreover, both regions have a strong dependency on rain-fed agriculture for economic development with hydroelectricity and biomass as main sources of energy. Consequently, adaptation measures are required for all the sectors but especially in agriculture, health, and energy where the loss of soil productivity, increasing spread of climate-sensitive diseases, and reduction of water and energy source supply are already threatening the social and economic security of both regions. Both regions have a wealth of indigenous knowledge and coping mechanisms of various local communities that should be incorporated into conventional adaptation measures of climate change.

This chapter critically examines the role of agroforestry in natural resource (soil, water, nutrients, biodiversity) conservation, livelihood security (goods and services to society), providing social and economic well-being to people and carbon sequestration. Moreover, the role of agroforestry is more pronounced and relevant in degraded and fragile agroecosystems, such as the Himalayas. Agroforestry in the Himalayas contributes significantly to ecological, social and economic functions and serves as complementary to natural forests. Therefore, a winning strategy for natural resource conservation and human welfare in the fragile Himalayas can be achieved by promoting scientific agroforestry practices to reconcile food production with conservation in climate change scenario. Agroforestry needs to be strengthened by developing appropriate innovative technologies, community participation, domestication, strong policy support and establishing strong market linkages. Similarly, efforts are needed to promote science-based decision-making, and future thrust is required to remove the remaining uncertainties and to also carefully test the agroforestry practices against other land uses in Himalayan ecosystems in order to know their suitability and to what extent agroforestry can serve mankind and ecosystems. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.","Agroforestry; Climate change; Ecosystems; Mitigation; Natural resource",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018587255

During pre-industrial era (1750 AD), their concentrations were 280 ppm, 715 ppb and 270 ppb, respectively, and these values have increased to 385 ppm, 1797 ppb and 322 ppb, respectively, in 2008. Increase in atmospheric CO2 promotes growth and productivity of plants with C3 photosynthetic pathway, but the increase in temperature, on the other hand, can reduce crop duration, increase crop respiration rates, affect the survival and distribution of pest populations and may hasten nutrient mineralization in soil, decrease fertilizer use efficiency and increase evapotranspiration and soil salinity. The water resources which are already scarce may come under enhanced stress. In the scenario of sea-level rise due to climate change, the inundated area with sea water will increase influencing the crop production due to higher salinity. Thus, the impact of climate change is likely to have a significant influence on agriculture and eventually on the food security and livelihoods of a large section of the rural population. There are evidences of negative impacts on yield of crops with variable magnitude in diverse ecologies including soil salinity and waterlogging particularly in the developing countries. Adaptation strategies and mitigation through perennial cropping systems such as agroforestry can be the main approach in handling climate change and salinity-related problems. Upscaling of modern technologies such as conservation and smart agriculture, judicious utilization of available water (including poorquality water) for agriculture through micro-irrigation and water-saving technologies, developing multiple stress-tolerant crops through molecular biological tools, restoration of degraded soils and waters, promoting carbon sequestration preferably through efficient agroforestry practices and conservation of biodiversity should be promoted at regional and country level.

The basic principles of landscape restoration include controlling soil erosion, reducing losses of water and nutrients, sequestering carbon, strengthening biogeochemical cycles, managing soil pH and salt balance, enhancing biocomplexity, and creating disease-suppressive soil. The technologies for landscape restoration must include implementation of soil restoration at the landscape level, harmonization of ecological effects with current and future population and social changes, and utilization of traditional knowledge. Establishing vegetation cover, managing water judiciously, recycling plant nutrients, and creating balanced plant nutrition are important to landscape restoration. Long-term planning is essential to the sustainable use of finite resources and provisioning of basic ecosystem services.

From long-term series of benthic invertebrate samples from temperate rivers and streams in France, we analyzed diversity and composition shifts over time in relation to geographic elements and human stressors. Mechanisms for community changes were investigated with a trait-based analysis for the entire dataset and for a selected caddisfly community module. We observed a 42% increase in the taxonomic richness of stream invertebrate communities over the last 25 years. A gradual trend induced by water quality improvement was distinguished from a more abrupt climate change-induced shift in communities around the year 2000. Trophic amplification – the intensification of trophic interactions and pathways through the food web – was identified as the mechanism behind the strong community shift. Four lines of evidence for this trophic amplification are highlighted: (i) higher dissolved oxygen concentrations indicated a shift in primary production, (ii) the trait-based analysis of entire communities showed a bottom-up food web amplification, (iii) the trait-based analysis of the community module evidenced feeding strategy shifts and increased food web interactions, and (iv) the abundance analysis of the community module showed a productivity increase. These results lend credit to persistent investments in water quality for improving stream biodiversity, and contrary to expectation, climate change impacts seem so far to have reinforced these positive effects. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic macroinvertebrates; Climate change; Large scale; Response diversity; Shift; Time series","Amplification; Biochemical oxygen demand; Biodiversity; Dissolved oxygen; Ecology; Rivers; Time series; Water quality; Aquatic macroinvertebrates; Dissolved oxygen concentrations; Food web interactions; Large scale; Productivity increase; Response diversity; Shift; Water quality improvements; Climate change; dissolved oxygen; benthos; climate change; climate effect; community response; freshwater ecosystem; invertebrate; streamwater; temperate environment; Article; benthos; climate change; community dynamics; controlled study; environmental stress; food web; France; geography; nonhuman; oxygen concentration; population abundance; priority journal; species composition; species diversity; species richness; stream (river); Trichoptera; trophic level; water quality; animal; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; invertebrate; river; time factor; water quality; France; Invertebrata; Trichoptera; Animals; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; France; Invertebrates; Rivers; Time Factors; Water Quality",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979518513

During 1750 the concentrations for these gases were 280 ppm, 715 ppb, and 270 ppb, respectively which increased to 379 ppm, 1774 ppb, and 319 ppb, respectively in 2005. It showed an increase of 0.23, 0.96, and 0.12% annually. The same has further increased to 385 ppm, 1797 ppb, and 322 ppb, respectively in 2008 representing 1.6, 1.2, and 0.9% increase, respectively from 2005 levels at an annual increase of 0.53, 0.43, and 0.31%, annually. Increase in atmospheric CO2 promotes growth and productivity of plants with C3 photosynthetic pathway but the increase in temperature, on the other hand, can reduce crop duration, increase crop respiration rates, affect the survival and distribution of pest populations, and may hasten nutrient mineralization in soils, decrease fertilizer-use efficiency, and increase evapotranspiration. The water resources which are already scarce may come under enhanced stress. Thus, the impact of climate change is likely to have a significant influence on agriculture and eventually on the food security and livelihoods of large sections of the urban and rural populations globally. The developing countries, particularly in South Asia and Latin America, with diverse agroclimatic regions, challenging geographies, growing economies, diverse agricultural production systems, and farm typologies are more vulnerable to the effect of climate change due to heavy dependence on agriculture for livelihood. These regions also are demonstrating poor coping mechanisms to adapt to these challenges, and as a result there is evidence of negative impacts on productivity of wheat, rice, and other crops to varying extent depending on agroecologies. Upscaling of modern technologies such as conservation and climate smart agriculture, judicious utilization of available water for agriculture through microirrigation and water saving technologies, developing multiple stress-tolerant crop cultivars and biotypes through biotechnological tools, restoration of degraded soils and waters, promoting carbon sequestration through alternate production technologies and land use, and conservation of biodiversity must be promoted at regional and country level to ensure durable food and nutritional security. Reliable early warning system of environmental changes, their spatial and temporal magnitude, coupled with policies to support the diffusion of this information, can help interpret these forecasts in terms of their agronomic and economic implications for the benefit of farmers and to provide agriculture-dependent industries and policymakers with more informed options to support farmers. These countries need to formulate both short-term and long-term policies for improvement, sustenance, and protection of natural resources. There is an urgent need for capacity building through international collaboration in order to develop databases and analysis systems for efficient weather forecasting as well as preparing contingency plans for vulnerable areas. The objectives of this paper are to summarize the available information on adaptation strategies and the mitigation options for climate change to meet the food security in South Asia and Latin America. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Crop diversification; Crop simulation; Greenhouse gases; Mitigation; Mulching; Sequestering; Water management",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977635744

Agriculture can be directly affected through meteorological conditions that influence crop growth and yield. Here we explored changes in the yield of durum (winter) wheat Triticum tirgidum in the EMME region caused by projected changes in thermal and hydrological conditions, employing the agro-ecological zones (AEZ) methodology. The climate input was obtained from simulations by the PRECIS regional climate model over the EMME domain at 25 km resolution, driven by a range of IPCC emissions scenarios for the 21st century. For the crop yield calculation, we used 2 steps of the biomass calculation from the AEZ methodology by calculating crop yield potentials with regard to temperature, solar radiation and evapotranspiration regimes. Our results showed that for the recent past, the highest wheat yields are found in the Fertile Crescent and the coastal areas of eastern Mediterranean Europe. The former region is projected to be negatively affected by the additional heat due to climate warming, while in the latter region yield gains may be expected. Our implementation of the AEZ methodology can be based on a range of climate data and can be applied to a number of crops, contributing to yield studies relevant for regional assessments of food security. © 2016 Inter-Research.","Agro-ecological zones methodology; Eastern Mediterranean-Middle East; Regional climate change; Triticum tirgidum; Yield","agricultural ecosystem; biomass; climate change; climate modeling; crop yield; evapotranspiration; growth response; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; regional climate; solar radiation; temperature effect; wheat; Europe; Mediterranean Region; Middle East; Triticum; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976449604

These local ecotypes can show variable phenology and low-to-moderate edible yield, but are often highly nutritious. The main contributions of landraces to plant breeding have been traits for more efficient nutrient uptake and utilization, as well as useful genes for adaptation to stressful environments such as water stress, salinity, and high temperatures. We propose that a systematic landrace evaluation may define patterns of diversity, which will facilitate identifying alleles for enhancing yield and abiotic stress adaptation, thus raising the productivity and stability of staple crops in vulnerable environments. Global climate change emphasizes the need to use better-adapted cultivars of the main crops and landraces as potential donors of useful genes. The contribution of modern agriculture to total human-made greenhouse gas emissions is approximately 30%, and a shift to agro-ecological modes of production is increasingly seen as urgent, with landraces playing an important role in breeding programs.During the past few decades interest in landrace conservation has been growing, with much research focusing on the maintenance of on-farm crop genetic diversity.There is increasing consumer concern worldwide about food safety and nutrition.

This paper presents a multi-stakeholder, participatory planning process designed to screen and prioritise rural livelihood adaptation strategies against nine CCD criteria. The process also integrated three principles of adaptation pathways: interventions should be (1) 'no regrets' and maintain reversibility to avoid mal-adaptation; (2) address both proximate and underlying systemic drivers of community vulnerability; and (3) linked across spatial scales and jurisdictional levels to promote coordination. Using examples of two rural sub-districts in Indonesia, we demonstrate the process and resulting CCD strategies. Priority strategies varied between the sub-districts but all reflected standard development interventions: water management, intensification or diversification of agriculture and aquaculture, education, health, food security and skills-building for communities. Strategies delivered co-benefits for human development and ecosystem services and hence adaptive capacity, but greenhouse mitigation co-benefits were less significant. Actions to deliver the strategies' objectives were screened for reversibility, and a minority were potentially mal-adaptive (i.e. path dependent, disproportionately burdening the most vulnerable, reducing incentives to adapt, or increasing greenhouse gas emissions) yet highly feasible. These related to infrastructure, which paradoxically is necessary to deliver 'soft' adaptation benefits (i.e. road access to health services). Only a small minority of transformative strategies addressed the systemic (i.e. institutional and political) drivers of vulnerability. Strategies were well-matched by development programs, suggesting that current interventions mirror CCD. However, development programs tackled fewer systemic drivers, were poorly coordinated and had a higher risk of mal-adaptation. We conclude that the approach is effective for screening and prioritising no regrets CCD, but more extensive learning processes are necessary to build decision-makers' capacity to tackle systemic drivers, and to scrutinise potentially mal-adaptive infrastructural investments. © 2015 The Authors.","Adaptation pathways; Deliberative decision-making; Mal-adaptation; Multiple criteria analysis; Rural development",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962050787

Environmental Crises in Central Asia highlights major environmental challenges confronting the region’s former Soviet republics: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. They include threats to the Caspian and Aral seas, the impact of climate change on glaciers, desertification, deforestation, destruction of habitat and biodiversity, radioactive and hazardous wastes, water quality and supply, energy exploration and development, pesticides and food security, and environmental health. The ramifications of these challenges cross national borders and may affect economic, political, and cultural relationships on a vast geographic scale.

The results showed that ecosystem service value of per unit area from maximum to minimum were in this order: wetland, water, garden, cultivated land, meadow, other land, salt pans, saline and alkaline land, constructive land. The order of contribution rates of each ecological function value from high to low was nutrient recycling, water conservation, entertainment and culture, material production, biodiversity maintenance, gas regulation, climate regulation and environmental purification. The security baseline of grain production was 0.21 kg·-2, the security baseline of grain output value was 0.41 yuan·m-2, the baseline of ecosystem service value was 21.58 yuan·m-2, and the total of ecosystem service value in the research area was 4.244 billion yuan.

In agriculture, irrigation with wastewater may contribute to improve production yields, reduce the ecological footprint and promote socioeconomic benefits. However, it cannot be considered exempt of adverse consequences in environmental and human health. Apart from the introduction of some biological and chemical hazardous agents, the disturbance of the indigenous soil microbial communities and, thus, of vital soil functions impacting soil fertility may occur. The consequences of these disturbances are still poorly understood. This chapter summarises the physicochemical and microbiological alterations in soil resultant from irrigation with treated wastewater that are described in scientific literature. These alterations, which involve a high complexity of variables (soil, wastewater, climate, vegetal cover), may have impacts on soil quality and productivity. In addition, possible health risks may arise, in particular through the direct or indirect contamination of the food chain with micropollutants, pathogens or antibiotic resistance determinants. The current state of the art suggests that irrigation with treated wastewater may have a multitude of long-term implications on soil productivity and public health. Although further research is needed, it seems evident that the analysis of risks associated with irrigation with treated wastewater must take into account not only the quality of water, but other aspects as diverse as soil microbiota, soil type or the cultivated plant species. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Environmental contamination; Microbial communities; Public health; Sustainable reuse",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956959102

And yet, global health has mainly improved as these changes have gathered pace. What is the explanation? As a Commission, we are deeply concerned that the explanation is straightforward and sobering: we have been mortgaging the health of future generations to realise economic and development gains in the present. By unsustainably exploiting nature's resources, human civilisation has fl ourished but now risks substantial health eff ects from the degradation of nature's life support systems in the future. Health eff ects from changes to the environment including climatic change, ocean acidifi cation, land degradation, water scarcity, overexploitation of fi sheries, and biodiversity loss pose serious challenges to the global health gains of the past several decades and are likely to become increasingly dominant during the second half of this century and beyond. These striking trends are driven by highly inequitable, ineffi cient, and unsustainable patterns of resource consumption and technological development, together with population growth. We identify three categories of challenges that have to be addressed to maintain and enhance human health in the face of increasingly harmful environmental trends. Firstly, conceptual and empathy failures (imagination challenges), such as an over-reliance on gross domestic product as a measure of human progress, the failure to account for future health and environmental harms over present day gains, and the disproportionate eff ect of those harms on the poor and those in developing nations. Secondly, knowledge failures (research and information challenges), such as failure to address social and environmental drivers of ill health, a historical scarcity of transdisciplinary research and funding, together with an unwillingness or inability to deal with uncertainty within decision making frameworks. Thirdly, implementation failures (governance challenges), such as how governments and institutions delay recognition and responses to threats, especially when faced with uncertainties, pooled common resources, and time lags between action and eff ect. Although better evidence is needed to underpin appropriate policies than is available at present, this should not be used as an excuse for inaction. Substantial potential exists to link action to reduce environmental damage with improved health outcomes for nations at all levels of economic development. This Commission identifi es opportunities for action by six key constituencies: health professionals, research funders and the academic community, the UN and Bretton Woods bodies, governments, investors and corporate reporting bodies, and civil society organisations. Depreciation of natural capital and nature's subsidy should be accounted for so that economy and nature are not falsely separated. Policies should balance social progress, environmental sustainability, and the economy. To support a world population of 9-10 billion people or more, resilient food and agricultural systems are needed to address both undernutrition and overnutrition, reduce waste, diversify diets, and minimise environmental damage. Meeting the need for modern family planning can improve health in the short termeg, from reduced maternal mortality and reduced pressures on the environment and on infrastructure. Planetary health off ers an unprecedented opportunity for advocacy of global and national reforms of taxes and subsidies for many sectors of the economy, including energy, agriculture, water, fi sheries, and health. Regional trade treaties should act to further incorporate the protection of health in the near and long term. Several essential steps need to be taken to transform the economy to support planetary health. These steps include a reduction of waste through the creation of products that are more durable and require less energy and materials to manufacture than those often produced at present; the incentivisation of recycling, reuse, and repair; and the substitution of hazardous materials with safer alternatives. Despite present limitations, the Sustainable Development Goals provide a great opportunity to integrate health and sustainability through the judicious selection of relevant indicators relevant to human wellbeing, the enabling infrastructure for development, and the supporting natural systems, together with the need for strong governance. The landscape, ecosystems, and the biodiversity they contain can be managed to protect natural systems, and indirectly, reduce human disease risk. Intact and restored ecosystems can contribute to resilience (see panel 1 for glossary of terms used in this report), for example, through improved coastal protection (eg, through wave attenuation) and the ability of fl oodplains and greening of river catchments to protect from river fl ooding events by diverting and holding excess water. The growth in urban populations emphasises the importance of policies to improve health and the urban environment, such as through reduced air pollution, increased physical activity, provision of green space, and urban planning to prevent sprawl and decrease the magnitude of urban heat islands. Transdisciplinary research activities and capacity need substantial and urgent expansion. Present research limitations should not delay action. In situations where technology and knowledge can deliver win-win solutions and co-benefi ts, rapid scale-up can be achieved if researchers move ahead and assess the implementation of potential solutions. Recent scientifi c investments towards understanding non-linear state shifts in ecosystems are very important, but in the absence of improved understanding and predictability of such changes, eff orts to improve resilience for human health and adaptation strategies remain a priority. The creation of integrated surveillance systems that collect rigorous health, socioeconomic, and environmental data for defi ned populations over long time periods can provide early detection of emerging disease outbreaks or changes in nutrition and non-communicable disease burden. The improvement of risk communication to policy makers and the public and the support of policy makers to make evidence-informed decisions can be helped by an increased capacity to do systematic reviews and the provision of rigorous policy briefs. Health professionals have an essential role in the achievement of planetary health: working across sectors to integrate policies that advance health and environmental sustainability, tackling health inequities, reducing the environmental impacts of health systems, and increasing the resilience of health systems and populations to environmental change.

Rumination allows cattle - and other ruminant species - to digest fibrous feeds that cannot be directly consumed by humans and thus to make a net positive contribution to food balances. This contribution is of particular importance in marginal areas, where agro-ecological conditions and weak infrastructures do not offer much alternative. It is also valuable where cattle convert crop residues and by-products into edible products and where they contribute to soil fertility through their impact on nutrients and organic matter cycles. At the same time, environmental sustainability issues are acute. They chiefly relate to the low efficiency of beef cattle in converting natural resources into edible products. Water use, land use, biomass appropriation and greenhouse gas emissions are for example typically higher per unit of edible product in beef systems than in any other livestock systems, even when corrected for nutritional quality. This particularly causes environmental pressure when production systems are specialized towards the delivery of edible products, in large volumes.The paper discusses environmental challenges at global level, recognizing the large diversity of systems. Beef production is faced with a range of additional sustainability challenges, such as changing consumer perceptions, resilience to climate change, animal health and inequities in access to land and water resources.

This chapter relates the concept of IWRM to development in the context of the international community's sustainable development paradigm. Though there would seem to be a universal acceptance of the cross-cutting importance of water in development, relative marginalization of water at different levels has taken place because of competing interests. In the ongoing Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), there is only one target dealing specifically with water (drinking water and sanitation) within one of the eight goals (goal 7-ensure environmental sustainability). There is now a call from the water community for the adoption of a dedicated and comprehensive sustainable development goal onwater in the post-MDG follow-up. Some current topics that need to be encompassed by IWRM are succinctly addressed with reference to the recent international developments, including water security, human rights to water, gender equity, implications of climate change, governance, and the water-energy nexus.The ability of making operational the nexus of water with energy, food, health, and ecosystems by thinking ""out of the water box"" has become critically important. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA) 2015.

Vegetable and legume production and consumption are a potent mechanism for small-scale, disadvantaged farmers to obtain the required nutrients in their diets and to generate much-needed income through trade. Vegetables and legumes are key sources of nutrients and health-promoting phytochemicals, providing higher micronutrient contents and a wider spectrum of essential compounds to meet nutritional and health needs than other food sources. Diversifying diets with vegetables and legumes is a cheaper, surer, and more sustainable way to supply a range of nutrients to the body and combat malnutrition and associated health problems than other approaches that target only a single or a few nutritional factors. Furthermore, vegetables and legumes often accompany staple crops in meals, and most staple crops are less palatable without vegetable or legume accompaniments.

Access to adequate and nutritious food is essential to human wellbeing, peace and tranquillity. The relation between soil/environmental scarcity and conflict is complex, and security can only be universal, rather than local or regional, in the present era of globalization. Civil strife and conflict can be caused by both resource paucity and rapacity. Anthropogenic perturbations leading to soil degradation, climate volatility and growing human demands (e.g., food, energy, water, minerals) derived from soil are potential flash points triggering violence at local, regional and global scales. Among different types of drought, pedological and agronomic droughts are triggered by soil degradation, decline in available water capacity of the root zone and changes in the hydrological cycle. Several regions with unstable governments are prone to water scarcity and conflicts. Soil affects world peace through its impact on the quest for victuals, which enhances the relevance of the “Peak Soil” concept. Economic development and environmental enhancement must go hand in hand, and the highest priority must be given to development of the ecosphere.

Droughts have severe local consequences, but effects on food can be global. These current pressures are set in the context of rapid environmental change and socio-economic development, population growth, and weak and fragmented governance. We ask what should be the role of the water science community in addressing water security challenges. Deeper understanding of aquatic and terrestrial environments and their interactions with the climate system is needed, along with trans-disciplinary analysis of vulnerabilities to environmental and societal change. The human dimension must be fully integrated into water science research and viewed as an endogenous component of water system dynamics. Land and water management are inextricably linked, and thus more cross-sector coordination of research and policy is imperative. To solve real-world problems, the products of science must emerge from an iterative, collaborative, two-way exchange with management and policy communities. Science must produce knowledge that is deemed to be credible, legitimate, and salient by relevant stakeholders, and the social process of linking science to policy is thus vital to efforts to solve water problems.

They are highly interlinked to other global risks such as those related to climate, human health, food, human migration, biodiversity loss, urban sustainability, etc. Emergent risks result from the confluence of unanticipated interactions from evolving interdependencies between complex systems, such as those embedded in the water cycle. They are associated with the novelty of dynamical possibilities that have significant potential consequences to human and ecological systems, and not with probabilities based on historical precedence. To ensure water security we need to be able to anticipate the likelihood of risk possibilities as they present the prospect of the most impact through cascade of vulnerabilities. They arise due to a confluence of nonstationary drivers that include growing population, climate change, demographic shifts, urban growth, and economic expansion, among others, which create novel interdependencies leading to a potential of cascading network effects.

Any shift in their diversity and productivity has an impact on other aquatic life forms. We use a range of environmental variables to explore the possible drivers influencing phytoplankton composition over the last 14,500 years in a temperate lake Lielais Svētiņu, eastern Latvia. Using pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, temperature reconstructions and lithological information as proxies of environmental factors, we statistically test their associations with the fossil phytoplankton community composition. Our results reveal that during the Late Glacial, the climate warming, the decrease in landscape openness, and increase in organic matter were significant environmental variables affecting dynamics of phytoplankton communities, especially in the prevalence of Botryococcus, Tetraedron, Scenedesmus and Pediastrum. According to the Redundancy Analysis and Generalized Least Squares models, Pediastrum, Scenedesmus and Tetraedron were positively associated with waterlogging tolerance that indicates moist soils in surroundings of the lake, during the Early Holocene. The 8.2 ka cold event with a 2–3 °C cooling led to a strong environmental disturbance for nearly 700 years, indicated by an increased chlorophyta accumulation rates and a decrease in the organic matter. Our results indicate that Coelastrumreticulatum and C. polychordum are characteristic for the 8.2 ka cold event. Positive association between cyanobacteria and mean air summer temperature suggests that a warming favoured cyanobacteria over other phytoplankton taxa between 8000 and 4000 cal yr BP. High nutrient loads and water turbidity were more important for the dynamics of cyanobacteria from 4000 to 2000 cal yr BP.

Taken as a whole, this means more complex and integrated objectives for breeders. Several illustrations will be given of breeding such complex traits for different annual legume species. Genetic diversity for root development and for the ability to establish efficient symbioses with rhizobia and mycorrhiza can contribute to better resource management (N, P, water). Shoot architectures and phenologies can contribute to yield and biotic constraint protection (parasitic weeds, diseases or insects) reducing pesticide use. Variable maturity periods and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses are key features for the introduction of annual legumes to low input cropping systems and for enlarging cultivated area. Adaptation to intercropping requires adapted genotypes. Improved health and nutritional value for humans are key objectives for developing new markets. Modifying product composition often requires the development of specific cultivars and sometimes the need to break negative genetic correlations with yield. A holistic approach in legume breeding is important for defining objectives with farmers, processors and consumers. The cultivar structures are likely to be more complex, combining genotypes, plant species and associated symbionts. New tools to build and evaluate them are important if legumes are to deliver their exciting potential in terms of agricultural productivity and sustainability as well as for feed and food. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","breeding; ecosystem service; food; forage; grain legumes; ideotype",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908406831

Thus, crop yields are low, water and air resources are polluted, and the overall environment is degraded. Indeed, environmental sustainability in India remains a major issue to be addressed. Concentration of SOC is a strong determinant of soil quality. Furthermore, quality of soil also impacts those of plants and animals, and thus, health of human population. Restoration of SOC pool to above the threshold level of 10 to 15 g kg-1 in the root zone is essential to advancing food and nutritional security, achieving climate change adaptation and mitigation, improving water quality and renewability, increasing biodiversity, and alleviating poverty by increasing productivity. Among causes of the severe depletion of SOC pool are extractive farming practices of residue removal, indiscriminate plowing, excessive irrigation by flooding, none or unbalanced application of fertilizers, and use of dung as a household fuel rather than manure. Uncontrolled grazing and shifting cultivation also contribute to soil degradation. The extent and severity of degradation are exacerbated by accelerated erosion by water and wind, salinization, acidification, elemental imbalance, and anerobiosis. Thus, soil degradation trends must be reversed by improving SOC concentration through creation of a positive soil/ecosystem C budget. Among best management practices (BMPs) are afforestation and reforestation of hill slopes and agriculturally marginal lands. Establishment of plantations and agroforestry systems is another option. Some BMPs for cropland, essential to improving SOC pool and advancing food security, are conservation agriculture, integrated nutrient management, and crop diversification especially of the rice-wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains. Policy interventions are needed to promote the adoption of BMPs through payments for ecosystems services.

The issues of current concern to national food, nutritional and environmental security include: diversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural use, decreasing land holding size, declining profit margin in agriculture, depletion of ground water, deteriorating soil health and biodiversity, increased frequency of climate related risks such as cyclones/tsunami, drought and floods, cold and heat waves etc; contamination of soil and water with heavy metals like arsenic, selenium and fluoride and their cycling in plant-animal-human-atmosphere chain. Ever increasing concentration of green house gases in the atmosphere resulting in global warming is likely to have serious repercussions for human beings, animals, plants, microbes and environment. As per National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), 40% farmers want to quit agriculture and the young generation is no more interested in farming profession. Major shift in terms of diversification of agriculture into crops, commodities, enterprises, cropping/farming systems is called upon to revert the process of degradation of natural resources, rejuvenations of waste lands and also to make agriculture a profitable business. © 2015, Indian Society of Agronomy.

Through this analysis, we seek to compare adaptation needs with current trends in national, regional and global projects and collaborations. Our results suggest that initiatives supported by international agencies play a considerable role in achieving national adaptation priorities, especially in areas such as agriculture and water management. However, compared with specific adaptation options such as drought-resistant species and irrigation (which tend to be the scope of the projects), the analyzed documents tend to see challenges in agriculture more in the contexts of food security, livestock and rural development. They emphasize the strong connection between rural livelihoods and sustainable land and ecosystem management. Priorities listed in the national documents but not captured in current initiatives include human health, pastoralism, security and migration. Our results also show high levels of mainstreaming adaptation into sectorial planning documents, especially those on poverty reduction; however, compared with the focus on the project level, they here emphasize adaptations focused on institutional development and governance. Finally, the outcomes indicate that global, regional and national initiatives are distributed unequally and that countries in Central and West Africa and Central Asia currently exhibit low participation, especially in national projects. © 2015, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Arid; Global; National; Regional; Semi-arid",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929159068

This relevance enhances the charges by society as the environmental impacts of various activities, especially in relation to ruminant production amid the current problems of climate changes. In this context, we analyzed the main environmental impacts of two typical beef cattle production systems from southern Brazil, namely the extensive system (ES) and the improved system (IS), and identified the components that have the greatest environmental impacts using the life cycle assessment method. The basis of the system construction was a cattle herd that originated from 100 weaned heifers, four weaned calves, and the progeny of these cattle during their productive life (12 years), and the land areas, external inputs, and other natural resources and technologies necessary to the operations. The functional unit was the production of 1 kg of live weight. The values of greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and freshwater depletion in the ES were higher compared with those values obtained for the IS (22.52 and 9.16 kg CO2 equivalents; 234.78 and 21.03 m2a; and 0.217 and 0.0949 m3, respectively). These variations were attributed to the permanence time of the animals in each system and to the quality and production of the pastures. The ES presented lower potential impacts than the IS on metal depletion and soil acidification (0.000519 and 0.0536 kg Fe equivalents; and 0.0028 and 0.0038 kg SO2 equivalents, respectively) mainly due to the pasture improvement practices and the salt supply to the animals. Moreover, the values of freshwater eutrophication and fossil depletion were higher in the ES than in the IS (0.00383 and 0.00219 kg P equivalents and 0.0042 and -0.1255 kg oil equivalents, respectively). While the pasture nutrient loss from runoff and leaching defined the values of eutrophication, the introduction of legumes compensates the use of fossil fuels. The diversity of the results provides a better understanding of the environmental impacts of different production systems and of regional singularities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Projections of rising greenhouse gas emissions suggest increasing direct and indirect burden of infectious and noninfectious disease, effects on food and water security, and other societal disruptions. As the effects of climate change cannot be isolated from social and ecological determinants of disease that will mitigate or exacerbate forecasted health outcomes, multidisciplinary collaboration is critically needed. OBJECTIVES The aim of this article was to review the links between climate change and its upstream drivers (ie, processes leading to greenhouse gas emissions) and health outcomes, and identify existing opportunities to leverage more integrated global health and climate actions to prevent, prepare for, and respond to anthropogenic pressures. METHODS We conducted a literature review of current and projected health outcomes associated with climate change, drawing on findings and our collective expertise to review opportunities for adaptation and mitigation across disciplines. FINDINGS Health outcomes related to climate change affect a wide range of stakeholders, providing ready collaborative opportunities for interventions, which can be differentiated by addressing the upstream drivers leading to climate change or the downstream effects of climate change itself. CONCLUSIONS Although health professionals are challenged with risks from climate change and its drivers, the adverse health outcomes cannot be resolved by the public health community alone. A phase change in global health is needed to move from a passive responder in partnership with other societal sectors to drive innovative alternatives. It is essential for global health to step outside of its traditional boundaries to engage with other stakeholders to develop policy and practical solutions to mitigate disease burden of climate change and its drivers; this will also yield compound benefits that help address other health, environmental, and societal challenges. © 2015 The Authors.

Biochar has gained international research attention, but few studies have investigated the potential of biochar to address the challenges in SSA. This paper seeks to identify and evaluate generic potential opportunities and constraints associated with biochar application in sub-Saharan Africa using Zimbabwe as case study. Specific objectives were to; (1) identify and quantify feedstocks for biochar production; (2) review literature on the biochar properties, and evaluate its potential applications in agriculture, environmental remediation and energy provision, and (3) identify research gaps, risks and constraints associated with biochar technology. Biochar feedstocks in Zimbabwe were estimated to be 9.9Mtonyr-1, predominantly derived from manure (88%) and firewood (10%). This will yield 3.5, 1.7 and 3.1Mtonyr-1 of biochar, bio-oil and synthetic gas, respectively. Land application of the 3.5Mtonyr-1 of biochar (≈63% C) would sequester approximately 2.2Mtonyr-1 of soil carbon in Zimbabwe alone, while simultaneously minimizing the environmental and public health risks, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with solid organic wastes. Biochar potentially enhances soil and crop productivity through enhanced nutrient and soil moisture availability, amelioration of acidic soils and stimulation of microbial diversity and activity. Due to its excellent adsorption properties, biochar has potential applications in industrial and environmental applications including water and wastewater treatment, remediation and revegetation of contaminated soils and water. Biochar products have energy values comparable or higher than those of traditional biomass fuels; thereby making them ideal alternative sources of energy especially for poor households without access to electricity. Before the benefits of biochar can be realized in SSA, there is need to overcome multiple risks and constraints such as lack of finance, socio-economic constraints including negative perceptions and attitudes among both researchers and consumers, and environmental and public health risks. Therefore, there is need to conduct fundamental research to demonstrate the benefits of biochar applications, and develop policy framework and criteria for its production and subsequent adoption. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Biochar; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Crop productivity; Energy provision; Pyrolysis; Smallholder agroecosystems; Zimbabwe","biochar; charcoal; unclassified drug; biochar; soil; biofuel; biomass; carbon sequestration; charcoal; climate change; crop production; energy planning; health risk; potential energy; resource assessment; smallholder; adsorption; Africa south of the Sahara; agriculture; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; crop production; ecosystem restoration; energy resource; manure; microbial activity; microbial diversity; organic waste; pyrolysis; revegetation; Review; soil moisture; soil quality; carbon sequestration; chemistry; environmental protection; human; industry; risk; soil; Zimbabwe; Sahara; Zimbabwe; Africa South of the Sahara; Carbon Sequestration; Charcoal; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Industry; Risk; Soil; Zimbabwe",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919914861

The objective of our study was to develop a method to assess soil sustainability to erosion under changes in land use and climate. The method was applied in a typical mixed Mediterranean landscape in a wine-growing watershed (75km2) within the Languedoc region (La Peyne, France) for two periods: a first period with the current climate and land use and a second period with the climate and land use scenarios at the end of the twenty-first century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1B future rainfall scenarios from the Météo France General circulation model was coupled with four contrasting land use change scenarios that were designed using a spatially-explicit land use change model. Mean annual erosion rate was estimated with an expert-based soil erosion model. Soil life expectancy was assessed using soil depth. Soil erosion rate and soil life expectancy were combined into a sustainability index. The median simulated soil erosion rate for the current period was 3.5t/ha/year and the soil life expectancy was 273 years, showing a low sustainability of soils. For the future period with the same land use distribution, the median simulated soil erosion rate was 4.2t/ha/year and the soil life expectancy was 249 years. The results show that soil erosion rate and soil life expectancy are more sensitive to changes in land use than to changes in precipitation.

In the face of the projected growth in population and in biofuel demands, as well as shifts in climate and dietary habits, a more sustainable management of water resources in agroecosystems is needed. The field of ecohydrology, traditionally focusing on natural ecosystems, has the potential to offer the necessary quantitative tools to assess and compare agricultural enterprises across climates, soil types, crops, and irrigation strategies, accounting for the unpredictability of the hydro-climatic forcing. Here, agricultural sustainability and productivity are assessed with reference to water productivity (defined as the ratio between yield and total supplied water), yields, water requirements, and their variability—a crucial element for food security and resource allocation planning. These synthetic indicators are quantified by means of a probabilistic description of the soil water balance and crop development. The model results allow the interpretation of patterns of water productivity observed in Zea mays (maize) and Triticum aestivum (wheat), grown under a variety of soils, climates, and irrigation strategies. Employing the same modeling framework, the impact of rainfall pattern and irrigation strategy on yield and water requirements is further explored. The obtained standard deviations of yield and water requirements suggest the existence of a nonlinear tradeoff between yield stabilization and variability of water requirements, which in turn is strongly impacted by irrigation strategy. Moreover, intermediate rainfall amounts are associated to the highest variability in yields and irrigation requirements, although allowing the maximum water productivity. The existence of these tradeoffs between productivity, reliability, and sustainability poses a problem for water management, in particular in mesic climates. © 2014, Society for Mathematical Biology.","Irrigation; Rainfall unpredictability; Stochastic soil water balance; Sustainability; Water productivity; Yield","agriculture; ecosystem; environmental protection; human; hydrology; irrigation (agriculture); mathematical phenomena; procedures; statistical model; Agricultural Irrigation; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Hydrology; Mathematical Concepts; Models, Statistical",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939459801

Current ocean trends, coupled with terrestrial defaunation lessons, suggest that marine defaunation rates will rapidly intensify as human use of the oceans industrializes. Though protected areas are a powerful tool to harness ocean productivity, especially when designed with future climate in mind, additional management strategies will be required.

The total biomass of the plant life found in grasslands accounts for about one-third of all land vegetation (Mooney et al., 2001). Grasslands are an important part of the greater terrestrial ecosystem, serving as an important ecological barrier, playing a role in climate regulation, and contributing to global and regional ecosystem balance (Chen and Jiang, 2003; Lu et al., 2009). They provide significant ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation, regulation of the quantity and quality of water flows, sandstorm abatement and erosion and desertification control; they also serve an important function as a carbon sink (carbon stored in live vegetation), accounting for approximately one-sixth of the total global carbon biomass stock and a quarter of global soil carbon stock (de Fries et al., 1999; Mooney et al., 2001). In addition to their ecological importance, grasslands make up nearly 70% of all land used for agriculture worldwide (Suttie et al., 2005) and are a key productive resource for hundreds of millions of pastoralists who depend on grasslands for their livelihoods.1 More than 40% of China’s land area is grassland (Zhang, 2000; Chen et al., 2003), from the arid north-west and green meadows in the north and north-east to alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau and tropical or subtropical pastures in the south. Sheep, goats, cattle, horses and donkeys are raised on grasslands across China, sustaining the livelihoods of more than 35 million pastoralists (Liu, 2012) and contributing to food security for the whole country. Yet grasslands are very sensitive to changes in climate. They are complex ecosystems that rely on a balanced interaction between weather, sunlight, soil and water conditions, grazing animals and humans, and they are very sensitive to changes in any one of these factors. Even small changes can have significant effects on grassland biomass (the total dry weight of the plant life above and below ground in a specific area) production, species diversity and ecosystem services, all of which directly affect the livestock and the people that depend on them. As China’s temperatures continue to increase, and precipitation and weather patterns become more varied and more extreme (see Chapters 3 and 9), grasslands may see far-reaching changes in their size, condition (assessed by the proportion of a grassland covered by vegetation, plant diversity or biomass production) and ability to sustain life. For China, grassland-climate change impacts will be significant. Zhao Taihou is a herdsman raising more than 700 sheep on the grasslands of Siziwang Banner in Inner Mongolia. His livelihood is heavily dependent on the natural world; environmental and climate variability directly impact his family’s finances. There is a grazing ban in place on his summer pastures, but he can still collect grass and let his flock graze on his winter pastures. He is happiest when the grass grows well and his sheep have plenty to eat. Zhao’s primary concern is inadequate rain in summer and too much snow in winter. So far, he has been able to increase his flock’s resilience to extreme weather by installing pens that give his sheep some protection against the elements, but Zhao is likely to have to prepare for other changes to come. ‘To adapt to climate change, we have to reduce the number of livestock, but it will mean less income,’ he says. ‘We could also store more fodder each year. For example, we had 30 tonnes hoarded up for last winter. It would also help if we could dig a well so that we can water the fodder growing in the pastures.’ As with Zhao Taihou, many pastoralists in China depend on grasslands and their associated ecosystem services for their livelihoods and cultural identities (see Chapter 9). Changes in these delicate ecosystems could have devastating effects on a country carefully balancing the sustainability of its food production with the growing demand for food resources from an ever-increasing population. Thus, projecting and adapting to the potential effects of climate change on grasslands is necessary for China’s long-term sustainable development and social stability. This chapter provides an overview of China’s grasslands, some of the recent historical trends in their use and development, and the potential effects of climate change on grasslands and livestock production. It also discusses some of the recent research and work done to assess the impacts and risks of climate change to grasslands, using research from the Adapting to Climate Change in China I (ACCC I) programme as a case study. The chapter then summarises relevant policies related to mainstreaming climate adaptation considerations into grassland management and activities – being undertaken spontaneously by herders and promoted by various provincial governments in response to national-level policy guidance – to increase the ecological resilience of grasslands and the livelihoods of herders. © 2016 Rebecca Nadin, Sarah Opitz-Stapleton and Xu Yinlong.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086192678

It is also the portion of the planet that is perhaps in greatest need of data to address issues of the dramatic changes that are happening globally. Some of the changes are clearly the result of human inaction and lack of foresight. Fisheries, on which one sixth of human protein nutrition is derived, are in a state of near collapse for some species in the near term, owing to overfishing and mismanagement of a sustainable infrastructure. Lack of cautious application of new technologies and oversight has led to increasing levels of pollutants, sometimes catastrophically, as was evidenced in the recent Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Global warming is influencing many aspects of the ocean system and will have collateral impacts beyond simply raising the temperature of the planet. Navigation and influence on transport are chief in our envisioning eventual impacts, and need to be anticipated, based on the best of models and data. Sea level rise and the associated coastal erosion, modifying waterways and ports, call for adaptive planning. Climate change could easily be seen to affect ocean circulation, wind dynamics, storm production and associated storm surges. Loss of sea ice in the Arctic will open new avenues which are economically and energetically more efficient for transport. With warming, and heightened destruction of ice sheets will likely come increased hazards from sea ice in shipping lanes. The rate of loss of the ice sheets such as that of Greenland is only beginning to be understood, and appears to be increasing. Sea ice coverage in the Arctic was the lowest on record in the summer of 2012, and the area of surface melt on the Greenland Ice Sheet was recorded at the highest, at 97%, since satellite images have documented its status. Diminishing ice cover will also influence an increase of fishing efforts and exploration for fossil fuels in the high Arctic. Without precise data on the sizes of fish stocks, the effects on commercial fisheries are complex, and beg for fundamental knowledge. Additionally, with the loss of sea ice, diminishing ice-based productivity may lead to a loss of diversity and modification of sustainable trophic structure in Arctic food webs. As a consequence of increased fossil fuel exploration, extraction and transport, the risk of contamination is heightened and at present only minimal preparation for impact and cleanup exists for this eventuality in fragile Arctic environments. The addition of massive amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and oceans, has changed the ocean chemistry, increasing the acidity or lowering the pH. Sound propagation in a more acid ocean may affect navigation as well as migration patterns of marine mammals and fish. Acidification influence on calcareous organisms at primary production levels could lead to catastrophic effects on the higher organisms of the food chains. The collateral impacts of the changing ocean in a period of global warming urgently require further study in order to enable adaptation and reduce vulnerability. Only through an appreciation for the past and a comprehensive understanding of the present, can we anticipate the future. The potential for that vision of the ocean lies with the cooperation among all nations. Copyright © 2016 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

In more recent years this list has grown to include anthropologists, economists, engineers, medical professionals, military professionals, sociologists, and even artists. This approach has been strengthened and reinforced as current research continues to use experts trained in both soil science and related fields and by the wide array of issues impacting the world that require an in-depth understanding of soils. Of fundamental importance amongst these issues are biodiversity, biofuels/energy security, climate change, ecosystem services, food security, human health, land degradation, and water security, each representing a critical challenge for research. In order to establish a benchmark for the type of research that we seek to publish in each issue of SOIL, we have outlined the interdisciplinary nature of soil science research we are looking for. This includes a focus on the myriad ways soil science can be used to expand investigation into a more holistic and therefore richer approach to soil research. In addition, a selection of invited review papers are published in this first issue of SOIL that address the study of soils and the ways in which soil investigations are essential to other related fields.

This has consequences for the health of ecosystems and the services these provide. By considering the complex socio-economic interactions between the water, carbon-energy, food production, and climate cycles, UNESCO’s Natural Science Programme (principally through its International Hydrological Programme and the Man and Biosphere Programme) promotes trans-disciplinary approaches to help restore, enhance, and protect the sustainability of land and water systems. This new book, in the International Hydrology Series, is well aligned with the aims and objectives of UNESCO’s International Hydrological Programme by furthering the understanding and championing the potential of the ecosystem services-based approaches. Phase VIII (2014-2021) of the Programme is focused on ‘Water security: responses to local, regional, and global challenges’ and has a special theme on ‘Ecohydrology, engineering harmony for sustainable world’, to which this book is of direct relevance. The UNESCO Ecohydrology initiative involves the development of tools that integrate basin-wide human activities with hydrological cycles in order to sustain, improve, and restore the ecological functions of, and services in, river basins and coastal zones as a basis to support positive socio-economic development. Experiences gained through previous phases of the International Hydrological Programme, have shown that freshwater availability will become a major concern if no immediate action is taken to restore and enhance the associated ecosystems. Therefore, the knowledge presented in this book adds great value to inform global efforts on ensuring water security through UNESCO’s ongoing initiatives at the river basin level, such as the Hydrology for the Environment, Life and Policy, Ecohydrology and Integrated Water Resources Management Guidelines. The Hydrology for the Environment, Life and Policy in river basins initiative aims to deliver social, economic, and environmental benefits to stakeholders through research towards the sustainable use of water for human and environmental purposes. © UNESCO 2015.

As a consequence, in addition to the need to increase crop production, another major agricultural challenge is the task of improving the management of natural resources, especially through the adoption of more environmental-friendly practices, such as ecological intensication or conservation agriculture. Major agricultural powers such as Europe and Brazil have launched ambitious programs, for example, the Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) guidelines and the ABC Program (Brazilian Low Carbon Agriculture Program), respectively. xese programs give a special role to multifunctional landscapes to establish sustainable agriculture. Landscapes must be considered a whole land use system at the heart of human-nature relationships that need to be efficiently managed to preserve and restore ecosystem services (DeFries and Rosenzweig, 2010), and to contribute to sustainable solutions, especially regarding food security challenges (Verburg et al., 2013). In view of these global challenges, there is an urgent need to better characterize agricultural systems at the regional and global scales, with a particular emphasis on the various pathways toward agricultural intensification. Those systems are the key to understanding land use sustainability in agricultural territories. © 2016 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Climate change; Conservation; Crops; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Food supply; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Land use; Plants (botany); Sustainable development; Water quality; Agricultural intensification; Conservation agricultures; Environmental pressures; Environmental-friendly; Good agricultural practices; Low carbon agricultures; Sustainable agriculture; Water quality degradation; Remote sensing",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995395934

The new green growth is to be based on a low carbon, climate resilient, and resource-efficient economy, minimizing waste and pollution and protecting-restoring the earth ecosystem. In addition a green economy can create new jobs trying to solve both the EU problem of youth unemployment and the preservation of natural resources by the use of waste material from animal and plant biomass. Young people, in fact, are the group most adaptable to the changes, easily accepting jobs in the new and unexplored areas of bionanotechnologies, by the use of industrial by-products representing ∼300 billion/year of unused available and precious raw materials. Thus, the green economy has been recognized as a potential source of employment and a contributor to economic recovery, representing both a challenge and an opportunity for the labour market and the environment preservation. MAVI as producer of Chitin Nanofibrils (CN), obtained from the crustacean waste by a green technology, has been involved in different EU research projects to produce innovative biocomposites for pharmaceutical and cosmetic use and/or food packaging. By the Biomimetic project (www.biomimetic-eu-project.eu/) innovative emulsions and non-woven beauty masks have been realized; by Chitofarma (www.mavicosmetics.it) advanced medications have been made by biodegradable non-woven tissues; by n-Chitopack (www.n-Chitopack.eu) different food packaging have been made completely biodegradable and compostable. It is to underline that all the projects, based on the production of green biocomposites, have been based on the use of crystal-CN and other natural polymers, all obtained from waste material by a low consume of energy and water, according to the EU, OECD, and UNEP guidelines. The origin of chitin and its crystallinity has determined, in fact, the structure, morphology and the particular properties of CN used as filler, as well as the other bio-based polymers have represented the matrix of the composites obtained into the university of Pisa. In conclusion the different green products resulting from the projects will be shown by this paper, focusing the discussion on the present necessity for a sustainable development. A green economy in fact, implies not only a right economic, social and environmental development but also a bettering of the quality of life, through education and training in line with labour market demands, and human knowledge. At this purpose it is to remember that a young-looking is psychologically connected with the necessity to show a healthy appearance also. Thus, a healthy and beauty body, as well as an increased and ameliorated education is one of the priorities of the EU 2020 strategy, along with labour productivity growth, lower unemployment, better insertion of young people in the labour market, increasing public participation in education, and lifelong learning. Recent EU studies reported, in fact, that by 2020 2.8 million jobs are expected to be created by the green economy.","Advanced medication; Beauty mask; Bioeconomy; Bionanotechnology; Chitin Nanofibril; Nanobiomaterial; Sustainable development","bionanomaterial; nanomaterial; unclassified drug; Article; bioeconomy; economic aspect; human; market; medical device; nanobiotechnology; quality of life; sustainable development",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992055583

The need to capacitate the community's social and human capital in addressing climate change impacts to their livelihood, properties and natural environment is deemed necessary to lessen their vulnerability issues in the management of agriecotourism destinations. The study aimed to 1.) characterize and rank hazards that are likely to affect the nature-based tourism communities, 2.) describe the nature-based tourism communities' current sensitivity and exposure to climate stresses; and 3.) estimate future vulnerability and risks of nature-based tourism communities. Three agri-ecotourism communities were selected using five criteria such as attraction uniqueness, hazard type, risk level, tourism dependency and market potential. The areas were subjected to tourism vulnerability case assessment focusing on services and energy; human health; food, security, water and agriculture; business and continuity; and biodiversity and culture. Calaguas Island's top hazards are typhoon, drought and strong wind. Pecuaria Farm's main hazards are drought, rat infestation and grass fire while Bulusan Lake's major hazards are heavy rains and ash falls brought by volcanic eruption. Generally, vulnerability is high in the human health, services and energy sectors of tourism. The vulnerability of the three agri-ecotourism sites was intensified by factors that merely characterize the kind of community they have: a) high marketing dependency, b) poor political will, c) low level of awareness and preparedness, d) poor farming practices and e) lack of tourism-related livelihood options. Destinations with functioning agricultural areas are the most affected sites due to an estimated increase in the temperature and increase in rainfall precipitations. Poverty remains to be the major factor why vulnerability is high.","Agri-ecotourism communities; Climate change; Philippines; Vulnerability assessment",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969835777

The North American Arctic region is assessed in Chapter 28: Polar Regions. North America ranges from the tropics to frozen tundra, and contains a diversity of topography, ecosystems, economies, governance structures, and cultures. As a result, risk and vulnerability to climate variability and change differ considerably across the continent depending on geography, scale, hazard, socio-ecological systems, ecosystems, demographic sectors, cultural values, and institutional settings. This chapter seeks to take account of this diversity and complexity as it affects and is projected to affect vulnerabilities, impacts, risks, and adaptation across North America. No single chapter would be adequate to cover the range and scope of the literature about climate change vulnerabilities, impacts, and adaptations in the three focus countries of this assessment. (Interested readers are encouraged to review these reports: Lemmen et al., 2008; INECC and SEMARNAT, 2012a; NCADAC, 2013.) We therefore attempt to take a more integrative and innovative approach. In addition to describing current and future climatic and socioeconomic trends of relevance to understanding risk and vulnerability in North America (Section 26.2), we contrast climate impacts, vulnerabilities, and adaptations across and within the three countries in the following key sectors: water resources and management(Section 26.3); ecosystems and biodiversity (Section 26.4); agriculture and food security (Section 26.5); human health (Section 26.6); and key economic sectors and services (Section 26.7). We use a comparative and place-based approach to explore the factors and processes associated with differences and commonalities in vulnerability, risk, and adaptation between urban and rural settlements (Section 26.8); and to illustrate and contrast the nuanced challenges and opportunities adaption entails at the city, subnational, and national levels (Sections 26.8.4, 26.9; Box 26-3).

Climate change has also impacted public health (i.e., altered distribution and increased prevalence of allergies, water-borne, and vector-borne diseases). Rapid human population growth has exacerbated pressure over coupled social-ecological systems, with concomitant non-sustainable impacts on natural resources, water availability, food security and sovereignty, public health, and quality of life, which should increase vulnerability and erode adaptation and mitigation capacity.

Assessing the costs and benefits of wastewater use is challenging for decision making. Financial analysis of wastewater and other reuse options can underpin decision making from a business standpoint, and economic analysis provides the information needed to support public policy decisions. In this chapter, we provide a framework for assessing the finance and economics of wastewater and other reuse options. We examine several components of resource recovery and reuse, including water reuse, energy recovery, and nutrient capture from wastewater as well as fecal sludge and biosolids. We describe the cost-savings and partial cost-recovery made possible by wastewater use and we discuss value propositions for possible business models.

The region’s climate is projected to become harsher, with increased average temperatures, intensity of rainfall events, and increased variability in space & time of monsoon rains being consistently projected for the region. Without action in the form of adaptation of social, human, economic, and natural resource management systems, these weather changes are predicted to result in decreasing surface and ground water availability, flash floods, degradation of soil resources, decrease in crop yields, greater vulnerability to crop pest outbreaks, and declines in forest and pastureland ecosystem goods and services, thus rendering agricultural and herding communities extremely vulnerable to weather related losses of life, livelihood, and food security. In Rajasthan, government is focussing for sustainable development and climate change adaptation by finding and administering alternative methods to deal with issues of poverty and environmental degradation in context of linkage between livelihood and the immediate environment of the people. The livelihoods of the rural poor are directly dependent on environmental resources like land, water, forests — and are vulnerable to weather and climate variability. Climate change affects every aspect of society, environment and economy requiring adjustments in behaviour, livelihoods, infrastructure, laws, policies and institutions in response to experienced based expected climatic events. However, it was found that local coping strategies and traditional knowledge need to be used in synergy with government and local interventions. Solutions must be integrated to address the interrelationships between water, agriculture, forests and pastures, livestock. Finally, there is great potential for existing policies and schemes to be employed synergistically towards building true adaptive capacity for the rural communities. However, adapting to climate change will entail adjustments and implementation at every level – from community to national and international. © 2015 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

These terms are, by their very nature, ambiguous and difficult to define; they allow room, however, for a variety of actors to conceptualize water, food, ecological, economic, and urban problems in ways that allow them to move forward on contentious issues. This article focuses on the idea of water security and asks how it is conceptualized and used for regional policy debate in western Canada. We asked fifty-eight water stakeholders from the Saskatchewan River Basin to define water security, identify major barriers to security, and prioritize water problems. Responses showed there are myriad ways to think about water security, ranging from narrow conceptualizations, such as reliability, quality, and quantity, to broader sustainability perspectives about the nature of resource development and its social and economic consequences. The human dimensions of water security (governance, land use, and competing demands) were assigned higher priority than its biophysical aspects (flooding, droughts, and climate change). Framing water security to emphasize the human capacity to manage uncertain and rapid biophysical and societal change offers the opportunity to unite actors who otherwise would be separated by core environmental values, definitions of water security, provincial context (Alberta vs. Saskatchewan), and occupation. © Copyright 2015 by Association of American Geographers.","decision context; New Ecological Paradigm; sustainable development; water security",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920729427

This is an extremely important group for horticultural scientists and researchers to serve: more than half of all people worldwide already live in Urban areas, and more than two-thirds will do so by 2050. In this chapter we address the past, current, and future roles that horticultural science plays in the major issues of concern to public welfare: public health, environmental health, food security, and economic stability. Urban horticulture has important impacts on the health of the individual and the community, two concerns of public health. Documented individual health benefits include less depression and improved pregnancy outcomes from walking in or living near Urban green spaces. Community gardens, parks, and other Urban vegetation enhance community health by improving social interactions, such as family dynamics, and public safety, such as protection from crimes. Uses of plants to improve the Urban environment include temperature modification, air pollution reduction, and water quality improvement. Impacts on biological diversity are mixed. Other negative impacts include the introduction of invasive species. Urban food security requires food in sufficient, nutritious, and affordable quantities. Providing this for all people is one of the greatest challenges for horticultural science. Potential solutions include increasing small-scale food production in Urban areas by providing more community gardens or converting vacant lots. Horticulture contributes directly to Urban economics through the production and sales of horticultural products by Urban businesses. Indirect contributions from plants include higher property values and more productive employees. The increasing urbanization and aging of the human population is happening in conjunction with rising environmental destruction from global warming and climate change. Combining the traditional horticultural concern of feeding the world with an expanded understanding of the additional functions provided by horticultural products, the needs of Urban people, and the opportunities to partner with professionals in other disciplines will be essential in the unpredictable future. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

This paper starts with a simple framework based on three domains: nutritional quality, economic viability, and environmental sustainability, and calls for an integrated approach in research to simultaneously account for all three. It highlights limitations in the current understanding of each domain, and how they influence one another. Five research topics are identified: measuring the three domains (nutritional quality, economic viability, environmental sustainability); modeling across disciplines; furthering the analysis of food systems in relation to the three domains; connecting climate change and variability to nutritional quality; and increasing attention to inequities among population groups in relation to the three domains. For an integrated approach to be developed, there is a need to identify and disseminate available metrics, modeling techniques, and tools to researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. This is a first step so that a systems approach that takes into account potential environmental and economic trade-offs becomes the norm in analyzing nutrition and food-security patterns. Such an approach will help fill critical knowledge gaps and will guide researchers seeking to define and address specific research questions in nutrition in their wider socioeconomic and environmental contexts. © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.","Climate change; Health; Nutrition; Research gaps; Sustainability","Article; attention; biodiversity; climate change; economic viability; environmental sustainability; food; food insecurity; food security; gross national product; health care access; health economics; health survey; human; income; knowledge; measurement; medical research; nutritional status; nutritional value; policy; pollutant; population group; scientist; socioeconomics; tree; vegetation; water quality; catering service; economic development; economics; environment; interdisciplinary communication; procedures; trends; Climate Change; Economic Development; Environment; Food Supply; Humans; Interdisciplinary Communication; Nutritive Value",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84918511300

While there have been recent studies on the nature of these disasters, people's vulnerability and responses, little is known about how other key stresses, interacting with these extreme weather events, impact natural resources and the flow of ecosystem services that sustain local livelihoods. In this paper, we explore the process by which major stresses and hazards shape the vulnerability of people's livelihoods in dynamic social-ecological environments in the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh. Drawing on qualitative and quantitative data from a case study, we identify the key drivers of change in social-ecological systems and evaluate whether these drivers have affected livelihood outcomes and various components of human wellbeing. This analysis suggests that increasing salinity intrusion, tropical cyclone and land-use change (directly and through changes in ecosystem services) affect the access to livelihood assets at household scale. This undermines social wellbeing by seriously impacting food and water security. Through identification of key stresses and their interactions, and the consequent impacts on ecosystems services and household capitals, the current study proposes a conceptual framework to understand the present day vulnerability to multiple stressors in the context of the coastal region of Bangladesh. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Bangladesh; Coastal regions; Multiple stressors; Rural livelihood; climate change; coastal zone; ecosystem service; rural development; rural society; tropical cyclone; vulnerability; Bangladesh",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907512775

As the chief aim of this framework is to influence public policy, and this happens largely at the national level, we assess whether it can be used at the national scale, using South Africa as a test case. We developed a decision-based methodology for downscaling the framework and created a national ""barometer"" for South Africa, combining 20 indicators and boundaries for environmental stress and social deprivation. We find that it is possible to maintain the original design and concept of the framework while making it meaningful in the national context, raising new questions and identifying priority areas for action. Our results show that South Africa has exceeded its environmental boundaries for biodiversity loss, marine harvesting, freshwater use, and climate change, and social deprivation is most severe in the areas of safety, income, and employment. Trends since 1994 show improvement in nearly all social indicators, but progression toward or over boundaries for most environmental indicators. The barometer shows that achieving inclusive sustainable development in South Africa requires national and global action on multiple fronts, and careful consideration of the interplay between different environmental domains and development strategies. © 2014, National Academy of Sciences.

The governing bodies of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are encouraging parties to adopt ‘ecosystem-based adaptation’ (EbA) approaches, which utilise biodiversity and ecosystem services to support climate change adaptation. These approaches are wide ranging and include mangrove restoration to buffer against storm surges; watershed management to protect against droughts and floods; rangeland management to prevent desertification; and sustainable management of fisheries and forests to ensure food security. This article examines the emergence of EbA in international legal frameworks for climate change and biodiversity and progress towards implementation. The EbA concept is potentially powerful in catalysing international and national commitments to act due to its key defining features of a focus on societal adaptation rather than ecocentricism, and a targeting of the immediate adaptation needs of the poorest and most vulnerable communities who are adversely affected by climate change. However, examination of national policy and practice in two least developed countries, Samoa and Cambodia, reveals that institutional and legal barriers at national level can pose significant challenges to operationalising EbA to achieve adaptation objectives. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cambodia; Climate change adaptation; Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD); Ecosystem services; Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA); Samoa; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)","climate change; developing world; ecosystem service; environmental management; environmental policy; legislative implementation; Cambodia; Samoa",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911997987

The increasing incidences of air pollution, water pollution, land and soil pollution, solid and hazardous waste pollution, deforestation, soil erosion, silting and flooding are illustrations of environmental quality deterioration. The deteriorating quality of the environment slowly, but steadily, poses a threat to human security. These threats include increasing exposure to infectious diseases, water scarcity, food scarcity, natural disasters and population displacement. Taken together, they may represent the greatest public health challenge humanity has ever faced. There always seem to be intermediaries connecting the change in the ecosystem and human health. For example, such environmental changes as climate change, land degradation and aquifer depletion seriously affect agricultural production. Agricultural production is a major determinant of nutritional status and population health. Hence, human health is affected by producing or consuming agricultural products and not directly by land degradation or aquifer depletion. However, there are some environmental changes that directly affect the quality of human health, such as a rise in temperature, which causes thermal stresses, respiratory problems and deterioration of aquatic ecosystems leading to waterborne diseases. Other health impacts of the ecosystem degradation may be exacerbated by changes in other systems and processes, such as proliferation of bacteria, distribution of vector organisms or quality and availability of water supplies. The significant changes in health conditions and emergence of new diseases require understanding and are calling for new solutions in implementation of environmental health policies. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The rise in human pressures on global freshwater resources is in par with other anthropogenic changes in the Earth system (from climate to ecosystem change), which has prompted science to suggest that humanity has entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. This paper focuses on the critical role of water for resilience of social-ecological systems across scales, by avoiding major regime shifts away from stable environmental conditions, and in safeguarding life-support systems for human wellbeing. It highlights the dramatic increase of water crowding: near-future challenges for global water security and expansion of food production in competition with carbon sequestration and biofuel production. It addresses the human alterations of rainfall stability, due to both land-use changes and climate change, the ongoing overuse of blue water, reflected in river depletion, expanding river basin closure, groundwater overexploitation and water pollution risks. The rising water turbulence in the Anthropocene changes the water research and policy agenda, from a water-resource efficiency to a water resilience focus. This includes integrated land and water stewardship to sustain wetness-dependent ecological functions at the landscape scale and a stronger emphasis on green water management for ecosystem services.

Therefore, it is interesting to analyse organic agriculture which is a given set of farm practices that emphasise ecological sustainability. Organic agriculture can be characterised as being less driven by off-farm inputs and being better embedded in ecosystem functions. The literature on public goods and non-commodity outputs of organic farms is overwhelming. Most publications address the positive effects of organic farming on soil fertility, biodiversity maintenance and protection of the natural resources of soil, water and air. As a consequence of focusing on public goods, organic agriculture is less productive. Meta-analyses show that organic agriculture yields range between 0·75 and 0·8 of conventional agriculture. Best practice examples from disadvantaged sites and climate conditions show equal or, in the case of subsistence farming in Sub-Saharan Africa, higher productivity of organic agriculture. Hence, organic agriculture is likely to be a good model for productive and sustainable food production. Underfunding in R&D addressing specific bottlenecks of organic agriculture are the main cause for both crop and livestock yield gaps. Therefore, the potential for improving the performance of organic agriculture through agricultural research is huge. Although organic farming is a niche in most countries, it is at the verge of becoming mainstream in leading European countries.

From a societal standpoint, due to global climate change and increased global trade and travel, it is important to emphasize that the impacts of invasive species on food security, human health, and biodiversity will continue to increase unless steps are taken now to minimize their introduction, establishment and spread. Development of EDRR capacity at all levels of the landscape is a proven strategy for achieving those goals. © CAB International 2014.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927787048

The assessment was co-designed with regional public sector managers to address their needs for an improved understanding of regional vulnerabilities to climate change and variability. Design/methodology/approach – The study used IA of climate change impacts through a complex adaptive systems approach incorporating social learning and stakeholder-led research processes. Workshops were conducted with stakeholders from NSW government agencies, state-owned corporations and local governments representing the tourism, water, primary industries, human settlements, emergency management, human health, infrastructure and natural landscapes sectors. Participants used regional socioeconomic profiling and climate projections to consider the impacts on and the need to adapt community service provision to future climate. Findings – Many sectors are currently experiencing difficulty coping with changes in regional demographics and structural adjustment in the economy. Climate change will result in further impacts on already vulnerable systems in the forms of resource conflicts between expanded human settlements, the infrastructure that supports them and the environment (particularly for water); increased energy costs; and declining agricultural production and food security.

Livestock accounts for 40% of worldwide income from agriculture. Demand for animal products is set to continue increasing in the next three decades, as is their market price. If not carefully managed, a worldwide increase in the production of animal-derived products would increase pressure on natural resources (particularly water and land), significantly raising levels of dangerous greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the risk of people contracting zoonotic diseases. These realities are informing governments as they encourage the managed intensification of livestock production. They seek to do this in ways that take account of poorer people's contributions to the growth of rural economies. They look for ways to link together work on agricultural productivity, efficient food systems; infrastructure development; access to energy, water and affordable health care; and the sustenance of environmental services (including the mitigation of any further stimuli for changes in the global climate). Managed intensification of livestock production would also require long-term application of a One Health approach with its focus on mitigating health risks at the interfaces between animals and humans in different ecosystems. It will stimulate the joint working of multiple interests in pursuit of a common goal - ending hunger and malnutrition. The authors would like to see the One Health approach being incorporated within all nations' animal, environmental and public health policies and into the educational agendas of medical and veterinary undergraduate students. It must also be incorporated into preparedness, contingency planning, desk-top exercises and on-site simulations to get ready for the next mega disaster - no matter how improbable it might seem.","Food security; Livestock; Nutrition; One Health; Zoonotic disease","agriculture; animal; animal disease; catering service; developed country; developing country; economics; health; human; livestock; organization and management; policy; procedures; public health; time; wild animal; zoonosis; Agriculture; Animal Diseases; Animals; Animals, Wild; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Food Supply; Global Health; Humans; Livestock; Public Health; Public Policy; Time Factors; Zoonoses",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908133929

According to some projections we will need to nearly double food production in the next 4 decades. This article argues that protein production and consumption are pivotal to sustainability, because anthropogenic contributions to the nitrogen cycle are 100-200% compared with a contribution of 1-2% to the carbon cycle by mineral fuel combustion, with biodiversity as the main casualty. Because 1 kg animal protein requires w6 kg plant protein, its largescale production by means of factory farming is a major driver of biodiversity loss, climate change, and freshwater depletion. Furthermore, intensive livestock production is associated with antibiotics resistance and increasing incidence of emerging diseases. Therefore, a ""reversed"" diet transition back to less animal protein could make a difference. Some European countries, such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, and The Netherlands, have published integrated policy reports addressing food security, sustainability, and health combined. The food industry is focusing on food safety and increasingly on sustainability. An important issue is consumer communication, because consumer ""framing"" is radically different from that of governmental and industrial policy makers. There is no ""one size fits all."" A huge range of differences exists between countries and between distinct groups of consumers within countries; getting consumers to change their diets in a more sustainable direction is likely to require much more than gentle nudging. National governments and the United Nations should assume their responsibilities and initiate a global strategy integrating sustainability, food security, nutrition, and equity.

Irrigation efficiency and water savings have become watchwords in response to climate-induced hydrological variability, increasing freshwater demand for other uses including ecosystem water needs, and low economic productivity of irrigation compared to most other uses. We identify three classes of unintended consequences, presented here as paradoxes. Ever-tighter cycling of water has been shown to increase resource use, an example of the efficiency paradox. In the absence of effective policy to constrain irrigated-area expansion using ""saved water"", efficiency can aggravate scarcity, deteriorate resource quality, and impair river basin resilience through loss of flexibility and redundancy. Water scarcity and salinity effects in the lower reaches of basins (symptomatic of the scale paradox) may partly be offset over the short-term through groundwater pumping or increasing surface water storage capacity. However, declining ecological flows and increasing salinity have important implications for riparian and estuarine ecosystems and for non-irrigation human uses of water including urban supply and energy generation, examples of the sectoral paradox. This paper briefly considers three regional contexts with broadly similar climatic and water-resource conditions - central Chile, southwestern US, and south-central Spain - where irrigation efficiency directly influences basin resilience.

Furthermore, human activities place additional stresses on natural and societal systems and climate change is now considered a significant factor in these increases. The book documents the climate of the region and interactions of the climate with both the environment and societies in the region. The book emphasizes the impacts of climate change as well as strategies to mitigate and adapt to those impacts. A number of aspects of climate in the region that capture interactions between climate and natural and human systems are considered and include climate variability and change, climate and urbanization, climate and security, climate and society, and climate and sustainability. The book draws on published results in the scientific literature and the analysis presented highlights key climate-related issues for Asia and the Pacific. Subsequent chapters of the book include important issues such as: Climate variability and change – large-scale climate systems, trends in mean climate, trends in extreme climate events across Asia and the Pacific, challenges and opportunities for modeling the climate, current projections for future climate under climate change; Society and urbanization – trends in urbanization, interactions between urban areas and climate, climate hazards and vulnerabilities for urban areas, climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies for urban areas; Food, water and energy security – meeting future needs for rice and wheat across Asia, food from fisheries, water security, and balancing energy demands with reduced GHG emissions; Governance and sustainability – institutional arrangements to address the impacts of climate change, prospects for remote communities under climate change, effects of climate change on human health, low carbon development pathways, and ecosystem services to enhance the adaptive capacity of communities. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Asia-Pacific; Climate change and variability; Climate research; Sustainability",,Editorial,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052455718

There are observed trends in extreme climate events and evidence of changes in large-scale climate systems including the monsoon and the associated Hadley circulation. Modeling the climate of the region provides opportunities for improved understanding and prediction, but there remain challenges especially for mountainous terrain and small islands. Current projections for future climate indicate that existing stresses are likely to be exacerbated. Urbanization is expected to continue and better understanding of the interactions between climate and urban areas is essential. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of adaptation and mitigation both in urban areas and in small communities. Significant challenges exacerbated by climate variability and change need to be overcome so that future needs for rice and wheat can be met. Management strategies need to be implemented globally so that fisheries will be able to provide necessary food for the region. Local management strategies are also needed to ensure water security. Regional and international cooperation is providing initial support for integrated assessments that can investigate pathways towards low carbon development (LCD) across the region. Natural ecosystem services support substantial components of economies across the region and new strategies are being developed to enhance the resilience of natural ecosystems impacted by climate change. Natural ecosystems in Asia and the Pacific can contribute significantly to the mitigation of climate change. Communities, particularly poor and remote communities, are vulnerable to climate change and there is a need for capacity building in research, policy development and implementation to reduce these vulnerabilities. International cooperation exists in the development of mechanisms to promote systematic observations of geophysical variables. Further cooperation is needed to ensure that consistent high-quality socio-economic data are collected, archived and accessible.

Geographically located between the latitudes 10°N and 10°S of the equator, lowland tropical rain forest ecosystems share similar physical structure but vary in geology, species composition, and anthropogenic threats across the forests of Southeast Asia, Australia, Africa, and Central and South America. Mature tropical rain forests are stratified by multiple canopy and understory layers, and physiognomic properties include evergreen broadleaf tree species, a preponderance of species with large leaves to aid with sunlight capture in the light-limited understory, and leaf properties such as entire margins and drip tips that channel water efficiently from the leaf surface. Lianas are increasing in abundance and biomass in a number of tropical rain forests. The additive effects of an increase in liana biomass are correlated with a reduction in tropical forest carbon (C) storage, a value that is currently not considered in global vegetation models. Most rain forest tree species do not grow, flower, or fruit year-round. Peaks in leaf flushing, flowering, and fruiting coincide with the high irradiance and low water stress associated with the onset of the wet season. This synchrony is common and largely driven by resource availability, though biotic explanations for synchrony include selection to attract pollinators or seed dispersers and to avoid herbivory and seed predation. With few exceptions, species richness across the tree of life is highest in equatorial tropical regions and decreases towards the poles. Tropical rain forests harbor approximately two thirds of the estimated 350,000-500,000 extant flowering plant species on Earth, with high rates of endemism and large numbers of rare species. Numerous evolutionary and ecological hypotheses to explain the origin and maintenance of high biological diversity in tropical forests have garnered support and include biogeographic history, evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation and speciation, range size and distribution constraints, and ecological mechanisms promoting species coexistence. Continental drift, climate constraints, and long-distance dispersal are responsible for some of the similarities and differences in species across tropical regions. Familial similarity among forests in Amazonia and Southeast Asia can be as high as 50 %, while independent diversification and species radiation mean that much fewer genera (around 10 %) are shared. Gradients in climate, parent material and soil age, topography and landscape stability, and atmospheric deposition result in strong heterogeneity in soil nutrient availability from local to regional scales. Soil order, which is generally correlated with soil fertility as a strong predictor of aboveground net primary productivity in tropical forests. Tropical forests account for approximately 40 % of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP), store half of Earth's vegetative C stocks but less than 10 % of its soil C stocks. The relationships between rainfall, temperature, soil fertility, and NPP are complex and require more experimental manipulations to tease apart the interactions. Intact tropical forests are net C sinks, but the uptake of C (1.1 ± 0.3 Pg C year-1) in intact tropical forests is counteracted by the emissions from tropical biome conversion - a net C source to the atmosphere of 1.3 ± 0.2 Pg C year-1 that results in a tropical biome net C balance of approximately zero. Stronger El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effects are increasing the frequency and severity of droughts, fires, hurricanes and cyclones, and flooding events. Recovery of aboveground biomass, species composition, and forest structure all depend on the type and severity of disturbance and its effect on soil fertility. Greater use of remote sensing imagery from satellites, airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, and unmanned drones will allow accurate tracking of disturbance and C stocks as well as monitoring of phenology, foliar canopy chemistry, individual species identification, and biodiversity estimates from local to regional scales. The tropical biome is undergoing significant change. Understanding the drivers and impacts of these changes will require sustained advances across multiple disciplines. Ultimately as a society, we are left asking what is the capacity of our remaining and regrowing tropical rain forests to adapt to long-term anthropogenic and climate change and what can we do to moderate these effects while nourishing a healthy human population. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027232037

Grasslands occur on every continent except Antarctica, are ecologically and economically important, and provide critical ecosystem goods and services at local, regional, and global scales. Grasslands are surprisingly diverse and difficult to define. Although grasses and other grasslike plants are the dominant vegetation in all grasslands, grasslands also include a diverse assemblage of other plant life forms that contribute to their species richness and diversity. Many grasslands also support a diverse animal community, including some of the most species-rich grazing food webs on the planet. Grasslands allocate a large proportion of their biomass below ground, resulting in large root to shoot ratios. This pattern of biomass allocation coupled with slow decomposition and weathering rates leads to significant accumulations of soil organic matter and often highly fertile soils. Climate, fire, and grazing are three important drivers that affect the composition, structure, and functioning of grasslands. In addition to the independent effects of these factors, there are many interactions among grazing, fire, and climate that affect ecological patterns and processes in grasslands in ways that may differ from the independent effects of each driver alone. Grasslands occur under a broad range of climatic conditions, though water is generally limiting for some part of the year in most grasslands. Many grasslands experience periodic droughts and a dormant season based on seasonal dry or cold conditions. Grasslands are sensitive to climate variability and climate changes. There are well-documented shifts in the distribution of North American grasslands in response to past droughts, and both observational data and experiments suggest that grasslands will be affected by future changes in rainfall and temperature. Fire is a common occurrence, particularly in more mesic grasslands, due to the large accumulations of dry, highly combustible fine fuel in the form of dead plant material. Fire affects virtually all ecological processes in grasslands, from the physiology of individual plants to the landscape-level patterns, though the effects of fire vary with grassland productivity and the accumulation of detritus. All grasslands are grazed or have experienced grazing as a selective force at some point in their evolutionary history. The ecological effects of grazing vary with climate and plant productivity, and the associated evolutionary history of grazers in different grasslands. Grasslands have been heavily exploited by humans, and many temperate grasslands are now among the most threatened ecosystems globally. Widespread cultivation of grasslands was the major land-use change that impacted grasslands historically, while multiple global changes drivers (i.e., altered fire and grazing regimes, woody plant encroachment, elevated CO2, invasive species, fragmentation) contribute to the contemporary loss of grasslands. Grassland restoration aims to recover the diversity and ecosystem services that grasslands provide. While restored grasslands may attain productivity comparable to native grasslands and sequester carbon for extended periods, they typically support much less diversity than comparable native grasslands. Recovery of soil communities and properties is often very slow. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021661372

They have been ensuring a vital ecosystem service, since food production kept pace with population growth in the course of the twentieth century. Most of the past balance has been ensured through agricultural intensification. There currently is, however, an obvious mismatch between human population sizes (and thus food demand) and food production among regions of the world. Further, alarming signs indicate that maintaining a balance between the world’s population growth and its food supply in the coming decades will become a major challenge, especially in the context of global, including climate, change. Agricultural systems involve inflows and outflows, which determine their performances. Outflows include primary, desirable ones (e.g., crop yields) and secondary, often undesirable outflows (e.g., nutrient and pesticide losses to the environment). Inflows include non-substitutable ones, with essential roles for crop growth and plant metabolism (e.g., water, seeds, nutrients), while others are substitutable (e.g., labor, mechanization, pesticides). These inflows contribute to the growth-defining, growth-limiting, and growth-reducing factors, which determine three levels of plant production: potential, attainable, and actual. Three entry points to enhance the performances of agricultural systems are considered, through increasing (1) potential yields, (2) attainable yields, and (3) actual yields. The latter entry point, which involves improving crop health, has several advantages. One of them is that its likely impact is at least equivalent to increasing potential yields or attainable yields. Another critical advantage of increasing actual yields, especially through the improvement of crop health, is that it allows addressing not only the quantity of harvests but also their quality, thus fulfilling the goals of achieving both global food security and food safety. We propose that this conclusion applies to all levels of agricultural intensification, in particular intensive agricultural systems, (1) which are potentially more exposed to crop loss risks, (2) whose performances are particularly vulnerable to global change, and (3) which will continue to play a central role in global food security and safety. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.","Actual yield; Climate change; Crop harmful organisms; Crop loss; Food safety; Food security; Global change; Plant protection; Potential yield; Production levels; Production situation; Systems analysis; Toxins",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014564966

Using the lens of virtual water, I argue that the UK faces water security challenges of a scale unseen by most of its population due to its dependence on other nations, many of which are water stressed, for three quarters of its water. Estimates suggest that we would need to invest five times the current global rate in new water supplies if we are to meet the projected demand in 20 years time. With little chance of investment of such scale taking place, there is a compelling need for water professionals to emerge from their comfort zone. Engineers can play a pivotal role in addressing the water sustainability challenges, by engaging with politicians, decision makers, and those with influencing power. New models for integrated water management are needed to address complex multi-stakeholder demand patterns. While we can and should develop cost-efficient water technology, water professionals must grasp this moment to put themselves at the center of water science, technology, politics, environment, and economics.

Food security ranks high on the science, policy and development agendas. However, most research linking global change and food systems examines the impact of climate change on agricultural production, or the impact of agriculture on land use, pollution and biodiversity, overlooking interactions with other aspects of the food system - such as food processing, packaging, transportation and consumption and employment derived from these activities. This book demonstrates that new threats to food security which arise from environmental change require more than simply a focus on agricultural practices - what is needed is an integrated food system approach. The authors point out that the process of adapting food systems to global environmental change is not simply a search for technological solutions to increase agricultural yields. Tradeoffs across multiple scales among food system outcomes are a prevalent feature of globalized food systems. Within food systems, there are key underexplored areas that are both sensitive to environmental change and crucial to understanding its implications for food security and adaptation strategies. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.",,"Agriculture; Biodiversity; Food processing; Food supply; Land use; Adaptation strategies; Agricultural practices; Agricultural productions; Environmental change; Global environmental change; Globalized food system; Integrated food systems; Technological solution; Climate change",Book,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956798196

In this chapter, I want to trace broadly why environmental questions are today central to development debates, and what this means for political debates over the future of our contemporary civilizations. The chapter begins with an outline of the reflectivist challenge posed by ecological concerns, and provides a basic account of the contradictions this raises for development policy and analysis. This is followed by a discussion of some case examples, which help to highlight central problems in the environment/development debate. In the third part, I step sideways to take a look at some of the reasons why the debates take on the forms they have, and investigate the intellectual, practical and political conditions that sustain things in this way. The final part concludes by drawing out three broad ideas central to reconciling environmental and developmental concerns. Before proceeding, I want to put a few preliminaries in place, which will help to scope and evaluate the exposition below. In developing the observations and points that follow, I won’t be able provide any arguments regarding some rather large issues. For example, whether anthropogenic climate change is or is not ‘happening’ is one of the questions that has-rightly or wronglyoccupied most of the headline news on environmental concerns, and has underpinned much political work in multilateral forums. (Think, for instance, of the importance assigned to the allocation of, and trade in, emission permits; see United Nations 1998; HM Treasury 2006). Beneath such pre-eminent, global concerns, others occasionally gain public exposure, such as the problems of ‘food security’, the provision of drinking water, disease control, deforestation and desertification, the integrity of oceanic ecosystems, and waste management; all are intermittently prominent concerns in debates involving scientists, interest groups, governments, bureaucracies, businesses and laypersons. For the purpose of the discussion that follows, I want to move away from one aspect of these discourses that has been fairly pervasive, namely the tendency to treat the issues in question in terms of an either/or logic. On such a reading, for instance, either climate change is (significantly) down to the active transformation of ecological conditions through human activity, or it is a coincidental occurrence, contingent upon cosmic or geological cycles and their implications, but beyond (decisive) human influence. The general expectation is that either of these two positions will eventually be validated on the strength of evidence produced through scientific research. In the meantime, politics revolves around people throwing their lot behind either one of the two approaches, sometimes out of conviction, but more often than not out of selfinterested motives. Once the truth about climate change is established, the condition of uncertainty that feeds the political debates will be removed, and social and political organization be conducted in the light of the new scientfic consensus. This strikes me as unhelpful for the question of how environmental and developmental imperatives may or may not contradict one another, what to do about it, and how to construct an analysis for such purposes. While the question of human agency in climate change is eminently important, for example, for considering some really rather tough questions about justice, both intergenerational and intercultural, the effects of alterations in climatic conditions require responses, whether these particular justice dimensions can be explicated with the help of scientific consensus or not: some of the Pacific Islands, which are threatened by rising sea levels, for example, are home to populations for whom assistance will be essential, whatever the expediencies of the ‘blame’ question might be (COP15 2009). For the purpose of this chapter, I will then assume that the main challenges posed by the ecological question for thinking about development are social and political, rather than about scientific validation, and epistemological arguments over what sorts of criteria should count in the latter. Lest I be misunderstood in this move, this is not to suggest that the debates about the science of climate change and about the ethics of responsibility and guilt are not important and worthwhile; instead, I want to suggest that a rather large part of why environmental questions have the effect of complicating and altering the ‘development’ narrative retains its plausibility and importance irrespective of settling on the science of either climate change, or any of the other constellations alluded to above. As we will see below, the paradoxes posed by considering developmental and environmental imperatives next to one another occur in a variety of contexts with discernible impacts, and are therefore already a persistent part of what people have to negotiate in their day-to-day lives around the world (Bass et al. 2005). Having said this, I should also point out that a constitutive assumption I do make for the purpose of this chapter is that human societies in general do have the proven capacity to alter their natural environment in ways that are potentially, and frequently were, actually detrimental to their ‘interests’. Overexploitation of natural resources has been a frequent contributory cause for the collapse of civilizations, not to speak of smaller communities (indicatively, see Diamond 2006). Once we step inside human history for orienting our frame of reference, we will thus find ample reason for proceeding very carefully with claims regarding links between ‘know-how’ and technology, and ecological sustainability.1. © 2014 Routledge.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955682740

Moreover, it is believed that their low adaptive capacity and high dependence on resources sensitive to climatic changes makes them even more vulnerable to climate change. Adaptive capacity refers to the potential or ability of a community to cope with, adapt to or recover from the effects of an exposure (Adger, 2003). Rural access to alternative livelihoods (such as indigenous fruit trees) and degradation of these livelihoods during climatic stresses touch upon the crosscutting themes in this book: environment, equity and livelihoods. Rural people at tropical forest margins rely on forest resources to cope with climate events, among which non-timber forest products (NTFPs) play an important role (Eriksen et al., 2005; Fisher et al., 2010). NTFPs are products of biological origin other than wood derived from forests, other wooded land and trees outside forests (FAO, 2010). They provide food, medicine, livestock fodder and materials for handicrafts and construction among other things and they contribute especially to the livelihoods of poor and disadvantaged people in developing countries by helping to ensure food security, maintaining nutritional balance, meeting medicinal needs and supplying a source of income (FAO, 1995; Shackleton et al., 2002; Marshall and Newton, 2003; Emanuel et al., 2005; Schumann et al., 2010). In particular, people with little formal education and those in poor health turn to NTFP harvesting and use during adverse climatic events (Fisher et al., 2010). Among the plant species providing important NTFPs are indigenous fruit trees (IFTs), which are fruit bearing trees that are locally available, generally ignored by the commercial sector and not well researched. IFTs contribute to the food security of the rural poor, especially in times of famine (Akinnifesi et al., 2008) providing an alternative source of nutrition (Muok et al., 2001) and cash income (Akinnifesi et al., 2006). IFTs often also provide important medicine to local people (Iranbakhsh et al., 2009; Buchmann et al., 2010; Fandohan et al., 2010). Many IFTs improve environmental conditions in the savannah by adding organic matter and nutrients through leaf-fall and by reducing soil temperatures and water loss due to evapotranspiration (e.g., Amundson et al., 1995). Several IFTs also act as an important source of food, water (during times of drought) and shelter for a wide range of animals (e.g. Fenner, 1980). Among the most important indigenous fruit trees in dryland West Africa are the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata), the tamarind tree (Tamarindus indica), the shea nut tree (Vitellaria paradoxa), the African locust bean (Parkia biglobosa), the ber or jujube (Zizyphus mauritiana), the marula tree (Sclerocarya birrea) and the fan palm (Borassus aethyopum) to cite just a few (Boffa, 1999). IFT species are likely to be more resilient to climate change if compared to most of the current crops, which are generally exotic to Africa; IFTs have not lost the genetic capacity to cope with changes as a result of many years of selection. Although IFTs are especially important during droughts and floods - which are predicted to become more common in dryland Africa (i.e. annual mean surface air temperatures are expected to increase 2-4°C by 2099 in West Africa) (Boko et al. in IPCC, 2014) - little is known about the impact of predicted changes in climate on these species’ ecology, phenology (the study of seasonal natural phenomena), fruit production and survival. For example, changes of bloom dates for apple (Malus domestica) and pear (Pyrus communis) cultivars related to climatic changes have been observed in South Africa (Grab and Craparo, 2011). Changes in climate and soil moisture have also been reported to affect the fruiting of several plants in West Africa (Seghieri et al., 2009). Although no studies have determined changes in baobab phenology related to climatic changes, predicted changes in climate are likely to have a negative effect on its distribution across the African continent (Cuni Sanchez et al., 2011). Moreover, one should consider that predicted changes in climate may also accelerate the loss of already declining populations of some of these species through land-use intensification and over-harvesting (e.g. Obiri et al., 2002; Gaoue and Ticktin, 2007; Djossa et al., 2008; Houehanou et al., 2011). In the context of climate change, the maintenance of IFTs is important not only for biodiversity conservation (e.g. the baobab tree is an iconic African tree, being the national tree of Senegal for example) but also for the rural poor, as IFTs provide multiple services and are accessible in times of famine. While some services could be replaced with other techniques (e.g. soil conservation and water conservation techniques related to IFT presence in farmers’ fields), other services are not easily substituted (e.g. IFT edible nutritious fruits are available to be harvested when staple crops fail). Although several studies (e.g. Fisher et al., 2010) have focused on the role of NTFPs and IFTs during climatic stresses (see part (a) in Figure 9.1), little attention has been paid to the broader picture, in which climatic stresses directly impact IFTs and humans, in turn affecting management of IFTs and impacting tree populations (see part (b) in Figure 9.1). Finally, a decreasing number of trees may further impact human management of IFTs for the worse. As long-term monitoring studies of most IFTs (e.g. on population structure, phenology) are not available, local communities are a good source for information not only on management techniques but also on observed changes in climate and impacts on IFTs. Indeed, local communities in rural Africa have been shown to possess valuable knowledge about their environment (e.g. ethnobotany, Assogbadjo et al., 2008; Fandohan et al., 2010, 2011) and vegetation changes (e.g. Wezel and Haigis, 2000). This chapter mainly focuses on the adaptive capacity building loop of the theoretical framework of this book (see Ch. 1, Figure 1.1). It addresses the current local state of the environment, equity and livelihood security, the gap between the existing management practices and opportunities to improve them and adaptive capacity building in rural communities in Benin, paying special attention to IFTs as important NTFPs providers. © 2015 Dominic Stucker and Elena Lopez-Gunn.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955376285

Multiple species experimental systems act as interlinks between the natural environment and single-membered algal laboratory cultures. Microcosms can form a relatively controllable system to study phytoplankton ecology, primary productivity, phytoplankton-bacteria associations, food webs, nutrient dynamics, water- sediment interactions and biogeochemical processes. They can also be used to understand environmental problems such as nutrient inputs, eutrophication, species invasions, harmful algal blooms (HAB) and climate change. In addition, subjects related to ecological aspects like hot springs, temporary ponds and hypersaline lagoons can be investigated using microcosms. However, the artificial boundaries of the containers, the isolation of the experimental systems from the natural environment and unsatisfactory simulation of the physical conditions have to be taken into account when objectives are set and experiments are designed. The duration of a microcosm experiment is limited to the time period characterized by the system's steady-state conditions. Nutrient enrichments have to be well balanced to keep the steady state conditions as long as possible. The size of the initial community (inoculum) plays an important role in the maturity and replication of the systems and therefore it has to be considered very carefully. Once the objective(s) in a microcosm experiment is set, the particular system has to be standardized so that results from different experimental runs can be compared. Knowledge of scaling effects and artifacts of enclosure are of fundamental importance for obtaining results that can be extrapolated from experimental systems to natural ecosystems. In the present chapter physical, chemical, biological and ecological factors are reviewed. Experimental limitations due to spatial and temporal factors are discussed and applications referring to nutrient dynamics, phytoplankton ecology, eutrophication, modeling and climate change are presented. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This is an extremely important group for horticultural scientists and researchers to serve: More than half of all people worldwide already live in urban areas, and more than two-thirds will do so by 2050. In this chapter we address the past, current, and future roles that horticultural science plays in the major issues of concern to public welfare: public health, environmental health, food security, and economic stability. Urban horticulture has important impacts on the health of the individual and the community, two concerns of public health. Documented individual health benefits include less depression and improved pregnancy outcomes from walking in or living near urban green spaces. Community gardens, parks, and other urban vegetation enhance community health by improving social interactions, such as family dynamics, and public safety, such as protection from crimes. Uses of plants to improve the urban environment include temperature modification, air pollution reduction, and water quality improvement. Impacts on biological diversity are mixed. Other negative impacts include the introduction of invasive species. Urban food security requires food in sufficient, nutritious, and affordable quantities. Providing this for all people is one of the greatest challenges for horticultural science. Potential solutions include increasing small-scale food production in urban areas by providing more community gardens or converting vacant lots. Horticulture contributes directly to urban economics through the production and sales of horticultural products by urban businesses. Indirect contributions from plants include higher property values and more productive employees. The increasing urbanization and aging of the human population is happening in conjunction with rising environmental destruction from global warming and climate change. Combining the traditional horticultural concern of feeding the world with an expanded understanding of the additional functions provided by horticultural products, the needs of urban people, and the opportunities to partner with professionals in other disciplines will be essential in the unpredictable future. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Community gardens; Economics; Ecosystem services; Environment; Food security; Global warming; Horticultural therapy; Human health; Human population; Public safety; Urbanization",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948172700

Agricultural systems, for example, depend upon plant productivity, soil, the water cycle, the nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus nutrient cycles and a stable climate. Renewable natural resources can be subject to biological and physical thresholds beyond which irreversible changes in benefit provision may occur. These are difficult to define and many are likely to be identified only once crossed. An environmental limit is usually interpreted as the point or range of conditions beyond which there is a significant risk of thresholds being exceeded and unacceptable changes occurring. [1] Biodiversity loss, climate change and a range of other pressures are affecting renewable natural resources. If governments do not effectively monitor the use and degradation of natural resource systems in national account frameworks, the probability of costs arising from exploiting natural resources beyond environmental limits is not taken into account. Appropriate measurement methodologies need to be developed and validated to assess the capacity of natural resource systems to deliver benefits, such as relevant sets of indicators. Decisions at local and regional scales need to reflect the implications and trade-offs for natural resource systems inherent in policy choices to determine possible consequences for current and future wellbeing. Valuation of changes in the benefits provided by natural resource systems are being incorporated into existing Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) techniques used in policy impact assessment approaches. However, where there is a risk of thresholds being breached and potentially irreversible impacts occurring, additional policy safeguards to maintain natural resource systems within environmental limits are required. Managing ecosystems to maximise one particular benefit, such as food provision, can result in declines in other benefits. The evidence base is not yet sufficient to determine the most effective ways to maintain benefit provision within environmental limits, but a range of policy responses are seeking to optimise multiple benefit provision, including: • agri-environment schemes • generic measures to enhance biodiversity, which may increase the capacity of natural resource systems to adapt to environmental change • the use of ecological processes to increase overall natural system resilience to address problems such as flood risk management. The consequences of large scale and potentially irreversible changes in benefits from natural resource systems, such as marine fisheries, could affect ecological security to such an extent that it is rational to minimise the risks, even if there is uncertainty as to exactly where the limits lie. However, the policy response to environmental risks to human wellbeing is mediated by the public response to that risk, with public acceptance affecting whether policies responding to a risk are enacted. There are significant challenges to successfully communicating environmental risks to the public. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The Mediterranean - including most Arab countries - is one of the regions that has experienced trends toward more intense and longer droughts (IPCC 2012). Droughts are the world's costliest natural disasters, causing an average $6-8 billion in global damages annually and collectively affecting more people than any other form of natural disaster (Wilhite 2000). Given the consequences and pervasiveness of drought, it is important to assess drought severity, but the precise quantification of drought is a difficult geophysical endeavor. Drought is extremely serious problem in the Arab region, and will be an increasingly serious threat for all Arab countries that already are suffering from increased conflicts, displacements and instability alongside growing fragility of ecosystem services, with trends of land degradation, soil depletion and reduced water security. The Arab region is under growing food insecurity facing increased drought at a time when 28% of its population is already under in poverty. The high sensitivity of vegetation and crops to climate forcing may result in rapid land use changes and high vulnerability to land degradation and water insecurity (Evans and Geerken, 2004). A key challenge for understanding and addressing these risks is to bring together the science of climate change and drought risks on one hand, and emerging resilience based development policy responses on the other. Through cooperation of the LAS on Drought & Drylands and UNDP, this paper explores this risk-resilience nexus with a view to enhancing abilities to prevent impacts of future drought cycles on human development trends in the Arab region. This framework is based firstly on drought indices such as SPEI for analyzing long-term drought trends and satellite data from the last fifteen years to reconstruct past agricultural droughts. By measuring monthly differences in productive capacity of vegetation and crop patterns, this allows a characterization of intensity, variability frequency and persistence of agricultural drought in any given area. With this information, it is possible to identify the exposure of areas of rain-fed agriculture, rangeland, forests, irrigated croplands, individuals and cattle to agricultural drought as well as the amount of drought-affected areas experiencing land degradation, and to further estimate expected annual average losses (Erian et al., 2012). This scientific analysis is then coupled with a resilience based framework to development policy to assess resulting social vulnerabilities and development responses that can reduce risks while building long-term resilience of development results. The focus is on policies and actions that prioritize prevention of future risk accumulation and the exacerbating factors to underlying social tensions and challenges in the Arab region.","Arab region; Drought; Resilience based development response; Social vulnerability","Agriculture; Climate change; Crops; Disasters; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Land use; Risk assessment; Risk management; Vegetation; Agricultural drought; Arab region; Development policies; Development results; Rain fed agriculture; Resilience based development response; Scientific analysis; Social vulnerability; Drought",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925004359

The impact of global warming and continued, uncontrolled release of greenhouse gasses (GHG) has twofold implications for the livestock industry, and consequently food security. Firstly, the continuous increase in ambient temperature is predicted to have a direct effect on the animal, as well as on food and nutrition security, due to changes associated with temperature itself, relative humidity, rainfall distribution in time and space, altered disease distribution, changes in the ecosystem and biome composition. Secondly, the responsibility of livestock production is to limit the release of greenhouse gases (GHG) or the carbon footprint, in order to ensure future sustainability. This can be done by implementing new or adapted climate-smart production systems, the use of known and new technologies to turn waste into assets, and by promoting sustainable human diets with low environmental impacts. The following elements, which are related to livestock production and climate change, are discussed in this paper: (1) restoring the value of grasslands/rangelands, (2) pastoral risk management and decision support systems, (3) improved production efficiency, (4) global warming and sustainable livestock production, (5) the disentanglement between food and nutritional needs, focusing on nutrient rich core foods, (6) GHG from livestock and carbon sequestration, and (7) water and waste management.

They are widely regarded as the cornerstones of biodiversity conservation strategies worlwide, providing the main foundation for in situ conservation of flora and fauna, being an important element of any sustainable development. The double impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss are major threats to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, especially those relating to environmental sustainability, poverty alleviation and food and water security. Protected undeveloped areas are an important tool for land conservation in developing nations. Efficient land allocation decisions and resource management requires knowledge of non-market benefits. The contingent valuation method is a stated preference method of non-market valuation where respondents are asked to state their preferences for an environmental good or service that is not bought and sold in traditional markets. This study used contingent valuation method (CVM) to derive estimates of economic value for recreational benefits use of Albanian part of Prespa Park (AL-Prespa), in southeastern Albania. The contingent valuation survey used a dichotomous choice (DC) format followed by an openended question asking for their maximum WTP for restoration. Park visitors were surveyed regarding their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for ecological restoration and recreational benefits of area. The WTP responses were analysed using a probit procedure. The results of the study indicated that visitors are willing to pay increased entrance fees to finance ecological restoration and recreational benefits of areas damaged by human activities.

Maintaining and increasing global wheat production is therefore strongly linked to food security. A large geographic variation in wheat yields across similar climates points to sizeable yield gaps in many nations, and indicates a regionally variable flexibility to increase wheat production. Wheat is particularly sensitive to a changing climate thus limiting management opportunities to enable (sustainable) intensification with potentially significant implications for future wheat production. We present a comprehensive global evaluation of future wheat yields and production under distinct Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agro-ecosystem model. We project, in a geographically explicit manner, future wheat production pathways for rainfed and irrigated wheat systems. We explore agricultural management flexibility by quantifying the development of wheat yield potentials under current, rainfed, exploitable (given current irrigation infrastructure), and irrigated intensification levels. Globally, because of climate change, wheat production under conventional management (around the year 2000) would decrease across all RCPs by 37 to 52 and 54 to 103. Mt in the 2050s and 2090s, respectively. However, the exploitable and potential production gap will stay above 350 and 580. Mt, respectively, for all RCPs and time horizons, indicating that negative impacts of climate change can globally be offset by adequate intensification using currently existing irrigation infrastructure and nutrient additions. Future world wheat production on cropland already under cultivation can be increased by ~. 35% through intensified fertilization and ~. 50% through increased fertilization and extended irrigation, if sufficient water would be available. Significant potential can still be exploited, especially in rainfed wheat systems in Russia, Eastern Europe and North America. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","EPIC; RCP; Wheat management; Wheat yield; Wheat yield gap; Wheat yield potential; World wheat production","Climate change; Cultivation; Food supply; Climate models; Cultivation; Environmental protection; Food supply; Irrigation; Agricultural management; Agro-ecosystem modeling; EPIC; Implications for futures; Management flexibility; RCP; Wheat yield; World wheat production; Irrigation; Climate change; agricultural management; climate change; crop production; environmental planning; food security; global perspective; wheat; agricultural intensification; concentration (composition); crop yield; cultivation; fertilizer application; geographical variation; irrigation system; rainfed agriculture; Eastern Europe; North America; Russian Federation; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906726046

Persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have weakened physiological responses and are immunologically vulnerable to pathogens and stressors in their environment, putting them at a health disadvantage in climate-based rising temperatures, water scarcity, air pollution, potential water- and vector-borne disease outbreaks, and habitat redistributions. These climatic aberrations may lead to increased surface drying and decreased availability of arable land, threatening food/nutrition security and sanitary water practices. Coupled with HIV/AIDS, climate change threatens ecological biodiversity via a larger-scale socioeconomic recourse to natural resources. Corresponding human and environmental activity shape conditions conducive to exacerbating high rates of HIV/AIDS. In South Africa, this epidemic is forming a 'syndemic' with tuberculosis (TB), which has come to include multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) strains. Because of high convergence rates, one epidemic cannot be addressed without understanding the other. Concurrent climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies are becoming increasingly important to curb changes that negatively affect the biospheres on which civilisation is ultimately dependent - from an agricultural, a developmental, and especially a health standpoint. Mitigation strategies such as reducing carbon emissions are essential, but may be only partially effective in slowing the rate of surface warming. However, global climate assessments assert that these are not sufficient to halt climate change patterns. The roles of regionally specific climate research, socioecologically sustainable industrialisation paths for developing countries, and adoption of health system strengthening strategies are therefore vital.","Climate change; HIV/AIDS; TB","acquired immune deficiency syndrome; air quality; article; climate change; disease transmission; ecosystem resilience; environmental impact assessment; evolutionary adaptation; health care system; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection prevention; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; screening test; South Africa; tuberculosis; virus load; water quality",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905274562

This was a consequence of the rise in the concentration of biogenic gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and ozone) in the atmosphere that contribute, along with water vapor, to the so-called 'greenhouse effect'. Most of the emissions of greenhouse gases have been, and still are, the product of human activities, namely, the excessive use of fossil energy, deforestations in the humid tropics with associated poor land use-management, and wide-scale degradation of soils under crop cultivation and animal/pasture ecosystems. General Circulation Models predict that atmospheric CO2 concentration will probably reach 700 μmol(CO2) mol-1. This can result in rise of Earth's temperature from 1.5 to over 5°C by the end of this century. This may instigate 0.60-1.0 m rise in sea level, with impacts on coastal lowlands across continents. Crop modeling predicts significant changes in agricultural ecosystems. The mid- and high-latitude regions might reap the benefits of warming and CO2 fertilization effects via increasing total production and yield of C3 plants coupled with greater water-use efficiencies. The tropical/subtropical regions will probably suffer the worst impacts of global climate changes. These impacts include wide-scale socioeconomic changes, such as degradation and losses of natural resources, low agricultural production, and lower crop yields, increased risks of hunger, and above all waves of human migration and dislocation. Due to inherent cassava tolerance to heat, water stress, and poor soils, this crop is highly adaptable to warming climate. Such a trait should enhance its role in food security in the tropics and subtropics. © 2014 The Institute of Experimental Botany.","agriculture; animal husbandry; carbon dioxide; climate change; crop; forest; greenhouse gas; modeling; photosynthesis; soil; temperature; water stress; wild Manihot species; yield","Animalia; Manihot; Manihot esculenta",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901824385

In this paper we monitored the dynamics of population size and spatial distribution of Common Cranes wintering in Poyang Lake during 1998-2011 and analyzed the potential determinants of its population dynamics. This was combined with the monitoring record of the annual maximum number of Common Cranes wintering in the Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve during 1984-2011. We illustrated the changing trend of this Common Crane population over a long time scale, and analyzed the impact of climate variation and water level change on the population size dynamics. The results showed that the Common Crane population wintering in Poyang Lake significantly increased from 1998 to 2011, with an average population size of 2335±651 and a maximum of 7640 in the winter of 2011. The exponential curve fit well with the population growth trend (R2 = 0.808, F = 46.234, df = 12, P = 0.000). The wintering Common Cranes clustered in the Poyang lakes, with the lakes of Dahuchi, Dalianzihu, Sanhu, Hanchihu, Qihu, Zhuhu, Nanhu (gongqing), and Dachahu being the hotspots used by them. On average, (74.9±5.6)% of Common Cranes wintered outside nature reserves. The spatial distribution of the common crane was significantly positively correlated with the areas of mudflat habitat, and was negatively correlated with areas of agricultural land, human density, village areas, and areas of net primary productivity (NPP) in August and November. The mudflat area was an important factor determining the spatial distribution of Common Cranes, which accounted for 15% of the spatial change in occurrence frequency, and when combined with the NPP factor in November, accounted for 24.6% of the spatial change in the average number of Common Cranes. The results mean that there are still factors which may affect the spatial distribution of Common Crane in Poyang lakes which were not assessed, such as competition, the structure of the microhabitat, and human interference, which maybe contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the impact mechanisms of crane population dynamics wintering in the Poyang Lake. In the Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve, the average annual maximum number of Common Cranes was 276±51 (n =28), which showed a significant linear increase (R2 =0.176, F =5.537, df =27, P =0.026), but there was a drastic annual fluctuation. The results of Pearson correlation analysis indicated that the annual maximum population number of Common Cranes wintering in the Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve was significantly positively correlated with the average air temperature in October (r =0.480, P =0.010, n =28) and the average minimum air temperature in October (r = 0.480, P =0.010, n =28), and significantly negatively correlated with the average maximum wind speed in October (r = -0.450, P =0.016, n =28). As for the water level of Poyang Lake, no significant correlation was found between the annual maximum population size of Common Cranes in the Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve and the annual minimum water level (r =-0.259, P = 0.192, n = 27), or the annual maximum water level (r = -0.373, P = 0.051, n = 28). There was also no significant correlation between the population size and the monthly average water level in the wintering period. Although the water level of Poyang Lake in winter was tested and found to significantly change the structural landscape of Poyang Lake wetland, influencing the availability of habitat and food, the water level of those lakes in the nature reserve was largely determined by the artificial aquaculture discharge time and velocity of the lake, which eliminated the influence of water level in Poyang Lake.","Common Crane; Determinants; Population size; Poyang Lake; Spatial distribution","bird; habitat availability; microhabitat; monitoring; mudflat; nature reserve; net primary production; overwintering; population size; spatial distribution; water level; China; Jiangxi; Poyang Lake",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899952916

For instance, increasing salinization and aridity is forecasted to increase in most parts of the world. As a consequence, new stress-tolerant species and genotypes must be identified and used for future agriculture. Stress-tolerant species exist but are actually underutilized and neglected. Many stress-tolerant species are indeed traditional crops that are only cultivated by farmers at a local scale. Those species have a high biodiversity value. Besides, the human population will probably reach nine billion within coming decades. To keep pace with population growth, food production must increase dramatically despite the limited availability of cultivable land and water. Here, we review the benefits of quinoa, Chenopodium quinoa Willd., a seed crop that has endured the harsh bioclimatic conditions of the Andes since ancient times. Although the crop is still mainly produced in Bolivia and Peru, agronomic trials and cultivation are spreading to many other countries. Quinoa maintains productivity on rather poor soils and under conditions of water shortage and high salinity. Moreover, quinoa seeds are an exceptionally nutritious food source, owing to their high protein content with all essential amino acids, lack of gluten, and high content of several minerals, e.g., Ca, Mg, Fe, and health-promoting compounds such as flavonoids. Quinoa has a vast genetic diversity resulting from its fragmented and localized production over the centuries in the Andean region, from Ecuador to southern Chile, and from sea level to the altiplano. Quinoa can be adapted to diverse agroecological conditions worldwide. Year 2013 has therefore been declared the International Year of Quinoa by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Here, we review the main characteristics of quinoa, its origin and genetic diversity, its exceptional tolerance to drought and salinity, its nutritional properties, the reasons why this crop can offer several ecosystem services, and the role of Andean farmers in preserving its agrobiodiversity. Finally, we propose a schematic model integrating the fundamental factors that should determine the future utilization of quinoa, in terms of food security, biodiversity conservation, and cultural identity. © 2013 INRA and Springer-Verlag France.","Agrobiodiversity; Andean farmers; Food quality; Food security; Quinoa; Stress tolerance; Sustainability","cereal; chemical composition; climate change; crop production; ecosystem service; environmental stress; food quality; food security; nutritive value; productivity; tolerance; traditional agriculture; Andes",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899105803

Climate change will increasingly threaten our food production, security and even the survival of the human race. It also has a serious impact on natural ecosystems and the socioeconomic system. With the increasing scale and improvement in mechanization levels, the economic linkage between agricultural production and reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions is even closer in the agricultural production system. Therefore, the development of a low-carbon agricultural model is one of the long-term strategies for low-carbon economic growth throughout the country. This research of carbon footprint is introduced to measure the GHG emission over the rice production cycle. The carbon footprint can be defined as the total carbon emissions caused by an organization, event, product or person. At present, carbon footprints are used to measure GHG emissions in products, services, organizations, cities and countries and offer the decision basis for the formulation of GHG emission reduction schemes. Agricultural ecological systems, every year, also produce a lot of GHG emissions. The whole process of prenatal, intrapartum and postpartum agricultural production are closely related to energy consumption and GHG emission. In the process, all the agricultural inputs, such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, cultivation, plant protection, agricultural machinery, irrigation and harvest also produce greenhouse gas emissions. The whole cultivation of rice involves methane (CH4) emission. This study shows that rice cultivation is one of the biggest sources of GHG emissions in crop cultivation. Rice paddies emit a large amount of methane in their water logged mode. Different irrigation modes have a great influence on the emission of GHG. Straw return is another factor that promotes GHG emissions. Soil organic content increases with the return of straw, with an increase in the soil methanogen activity, leading to increased methane emissions. The current carbon footprint research is the first time it has been used to measure the carbon emissions involved in rice production. The carbon footprint for rice production in Shanghai was assessed by the PAS2050 paradigm and life cycle assessment. The study area, located in Changjiang Farm, which belongs to the Guangming Group in Chongming County Shanghai City atlatitude 121°32′22″E, longitude31°40′23″N. Chongming County, in the Yangtze River Estuary, is a typical sub tropical monsoon climate with mild climate, abundant rainfall, annual average temperatures of 15.3 °C, and annual precipitation of 1245 mm. It is the major grain production base for Shanghai city with winter wheat and summer rice forming their main planting patterns, which are typical for the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River rice-wheat rotation cropping pattern. The entire carbon emission of rice production in Shanghai was 11.8114 t CO2e (CO2-equivalents) /hm2, corresponding to a 1.2321 t CO2 e/t rice grain yield. GHG emissions from paddy fields were the major source, which emitted 0.9507 t CO2e/t rice and accounted for 77.1% of total carbon emissions during rice production. Moreover, CH4 was the largest source for GHG emissions with a contribution rate of 96.6%.Chemical fertilizers were the second largest emission source in rice production. Chemical fertilizers emitted 0.2044 t CO2e for each ton of rice production, contributing 16.5% of total carbon emissions in rice production. N fertilizer was the biggest emission source, which released 0.1159 t CO2e/t rice. This research investigates the GHG emissions over the whole process of the Shanghai rice production cycle and reveals the energy consumption and GHG emissions in rice production. Thus, a rice carbon footprint is calculated by assessing the GHG emissions in Shanghai rice production. The results are beneficial for producing reduction plans of reducing GHG emissions in Shanghai rice production. Furthermore, the results will supply both practicable and theoretical foundations for drafting carbon footprint formulations in other industrial areas.","Carbon footprint; Greenhouse gas; Life cycle assessment; Rice","agricultural modeling; agricultural production; carbon emission; carbon footprint; climate change; crop production; cultivation; decision making; economic growth; food production; greenhouse gas; irrigation; life cycle analysis; methane; paddy field; China; Shanghai; Yangtze Estuary",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895470234

The ensuing demands for water, food and energy would intensify land-use conflicts and exacerbate environmental impacts. Therefore we urgently need to reconcile our growing consumptive needs with environmental protection. Here, we explore the potential of a land-use optimisation strategy to increase global agricultural production on two major groups of crops: cereals and oilseeds. We implemented a spatially-explicit computer simulation model across 173 countries based on the following algorithm: on any cropland, always produce the most productive crop given all other crops currently being produced locally and the site-specific biophysical, economic and technological constraints to production. Globally, this strategy resulted in net increases in annual production of cereal and oilseed crops from 1.9 billion to 2.9 billion tons (46%), and from 427 million to 481 million tons (13%), respectively, without any change in total land area harvested for cereals or oilseeds. This thought experiment demonstrates that, in theory, more optimal use of existing farmlands could help meet future crop demands. In practice there might be cultural, social and institutional barriers that limit the full realisation of this theoretical potential. Nevertheless, these constraints have to be weighed against the consequences of not producing enough food, particularly in regions already facing food shortages. © 2013 Koh et al.","Biodiversity; Cereal; Climate change; Conservation; Deforestation; Development; Food security; Livelihoods; Oilseed; Yield intensification","agricultural land; agriculture; article; biodiversity; crop production; economic aspect; food security; geographic distribution; global change; harvest index; land use; maize; nonhuman; plant yield; rice",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888340517

A growing population and rising incomes with the resultant nutritional transition of millions more people entering into the middle class are some of the unprecedented challenges that mankind has never handled before. Food production outpaced food demand over the past 50 years due to expansion in crop area and irrigation, as well as supportive policy and institutional interventions that led to the fast and sustained growth in agricultural productivity and improved food security in many parts of the world. However, future predictions point to a slow-down in agricultural productivity and a food-gap mainly in areas across Africa and Asia which are having ongoing food security issues. The problem of food insecurity is expected to worsen due to, among others, rapid population growth and other emerging challenges such as climatechange and rising demand for biofuels. Climate change poses complex challenges in terms of increased variability and risk for food producers and the energy and water sectors. The major existing and emerging challenges to global food security are discussed in this chapter, giving relevant examples from around the world. Strategic research priorities are outlined for a range of sectors that underpin global food security, including: agriculture, ecosystem services from agriculture, climate change, international trade, water management solutions, the water-energy-food security nexus, service delivery to smallholders and women farmers, and better governance models and regional priority setting. There is a need to look beyond agriculture and invest in affordable and suitable farm technologies if the problem of food insecurity is to be addressed in a sustainable manner. This requires both revisiting the current approach of agricultural intervention and reorienting the existing agricultural research institutions and policy framework. Proactive interventions and policies for tackling food security are discussed which include issues such as agriculture for development, ecosystem services from agriculture, and gender mainstreaming, to extend the focus on food security within and beyond the agriculture sector, by incorporating cross-cutting issues such as energy security, resource reuse and recovery, social protection programs, and involving civil society in food policy making processes by promoting food sovereignty. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The huge projects of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) for diminishing flood and South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP) for driving water from Changjiang to Yellow and Hai Rivers to compensate for an imbalance of environmental resources will not necessarily solve all of the problems that they were originally intended to address. A sophisticated eco-hydrological model is required to evaluate the optimum amount of transferred water associated with these projects, together with socio-economic and environmental consequences. For this purpose, the process-based National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model was modified to couple with complex sub-systems in irrigation, stream junction, reservoir operation, and water transfer, to develop coupled human and natural systems and evaluate cause and effect of uneven water resources. The model clarified the impact of irrigation on eco-hydrological processes and predicted hydrologic change after TGD and SNWTP to estimate whether dilemmas between water stress, crop productivity, and ecosystem degradation would diminish. The result also showed the missing role of surface water - groundwater interactions and lateral subsurface flow, usually not considered important by assuming stationarity in previous researches of continental scales. A heterogeneous pattern of Time-Integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index gradient in agricultural fields helped to estimate uneven crop yield and its relation to water availability. This integrated approach will have some roles not only to re-consider this complex process from the view point of hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles, but also to clarify how the substantial pressures of complicated problems can be overcome by effective trans-boundary solutions. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Crop yield; Eco-hydrology model; Extremes; TINDVI; Water withdrawal","Crop yield; Eco-hydrology; Extremes; TINDVI; Water withdrawal; Catchments; Ecosystems; Floods; Forestry; Groundwater; Irrigation; Reservoirs (water); Water supply; Watersheds; Water resources; anthropogenic effect; biogeochemical cycle; crop yield; environmental degradation; extreme event; hydrological cycle; hydrological modeling; water budget; water resource; China; Hai River; Hubei; Three Gorges Dam; Yangtze Basin; Yellow River Basin",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885390156

The need for a robust, scientifically rigorous evidence base for effective policy planning and practice has never been greater. Environmental change includes, but is not limited to, climate change; it also includes land-use and land-cover change, including deforestation for agriculture, and occurs alongside changes in anthropogenic interventions that are used in natural resource management such as the regulation of river flows using dams, which can have impacts that frequently exceed those arising in the natural system. In this paper, we examine the role that land surface models can play in providing a robust scientific basis for making resource management decisions against a background of environmental change.We provide some perspectives on recent developments in modelling in land surface hydrology. Among the range of current land surface and hydrology models, there is a large range of variability, which indicates that the specification and parametrization of several basic processes in the models can be improved. Key areas that require improvement in order to address hydrological applications include (i) the representation of groundwater in models, particularly at the scales relevant to land surfacemodelling, (ii) the representation of human interventions such as dams and irrigation in the hydrological system, (iii) the quantification and communication of uncertainty, and (iv) improved understanding of the impact on water resources availability of multiple use through treatment, recycling and return flows (and the balance of consumptive and conservative uses). Through a series of examples, we demonstrate that changes in water use could have important reciprocal impacts on climate over a wide area. The effects of water management decisions on climate feedbacks are only beginning to be investigated- they are still only rarely included in climate impact assessments-and the links between the hydrological system and climate are rarely acknowledged in studies of ecosystem services. Nevertheless, because water is essential not only for its direct uses but also for the indirect functions that it serves (including food production, fisheries and industry), it is vital that these connected systems are studied. Building on the examples above, we highlight recent research showing that assessment of these trade-offs is particularly complex in wetland areas, especially in situations where these trade-offs play to the advantage of different communities. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Ecosystems have capacities to function as sinks for CO2 and regulate water flows in landscapes. There is growing concern over the impact of the imminent climate changes in the Anthropocene era on biodiversity and food/feed security. Biodiversity loss and poverty are two of the world's major challenges in the twenty-first century. By 2025, two-thirds of the world's population could be living under water-critical conditions. Arid regions (drylands) cover about 45-47% of the Earth's land surface, the largest biome on the planet, and are home for 38% of the total global population. Arid lands are prone to the dangers of climate change and are the most likely to be seriously hit. Plants use solar energy to power the conversion of CO2 into biomass. There is need for new paradigms in plant research and technology for the utilization of plants as biomass resources. Aloe, a genus of the family Xanthorrhoeaceae comprising of about 548 species, is a plant group that provides useful products and can also be used for ecosystem restoration. Medicinal use of Aloe leaves dates back thousands of years, and today Aloe plants are world-renowned as a source of natural products derived from the leaf exudates and mesophyll. Aloe exhibit remarkable morphological variability and range in size from dwarf species only a few centimeters tall to tree Aloe reaching heights of up to 20m. Aloe form a striking and important component of many arid and semi-arid landscapes. Aloe are associated with dry habitats and hot climates. About 10 species of Aloe are used as sources of herbal medicines and less than 10 can be eaten safely. Aloe vera and Aloe ferox are key commercial medicinal species. A. ferox and Aloe secundiflora are wild-harvested in the Africas. More than 40 species of Aloe are in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (2011) Red List of Threatened Species. The trade of all Aloe, except A. vera, is regulated by CITES. In this chapter, we review the biology and biotechnology of A. vera, with a special emphasis on clonal propagation. Major research has been performed all over the world on the conservation and clonal propagation of A. vera and Aloe polyphylla. At Jodhpur (Gateway of the Thar Desert), India, we have developed a method for rapid clonal propagation by shoot proliferation from axillary meristem(s) of selected germplasm (edible) of A. vera. The bud explants produced multiple shoots on Murashige and Skoog (MS) media+3.0mgl-1 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and additives. The shoots were further multiplied by repeated transfer to fresh nutrient medium and subculturing on MS+lower concentration of BAP. The maximum number of shoots was produced on MS medium+1.0mgl-1BAP and additives. The rate of shoot multiplication increased and the vigor of the shoots improved if the shoots were cultured in liquid MS medium with 1.0mgl-1BAP. The cloned shoots rooted in vitro on hormone-free half-strength MS salts+activated charcoal at 30-34°C. The cloned shoots were excised and isolated individually, the base of each shoot dipped in solution of 500mgl-1 of either indole-3-butyric acid or β-naphthoxyacetic acid for 5 min, and then rooted ex vitro on soilrite in glass bottles in the greenhouse. The plantlets were acclimatized and hardened in the greenhouse. These were stored under an agro-net-covered nursery. The cloned plants were transferred under different field conditions at various locations in Rajasthan, India, during different seasons. The method described here is highly reproducible and easier for mass cloning of A. vera due to the high rate of shoot multiplication achieved on low-cost culture medium and also the ease with which shoots are rooted ex vitro, facilitating quicker hardening/acclimation and field transfer. © 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, some Australians are food insecure and poor nutrition is responsible for about 16 % of the total disease burden and implicated in more that 56 % of all deaths in Australia. The two overall and closely linked concerns in Australia are food security and food sovereignty; improving the diet of Australians and maintaining its own capacity to produce and deliver healthy diets. These concerns are not easily resolved because of the dependence of the food system on high demand resources such as fossil fuels, fertilizers, water and productive land and the need to maintain profit in the system. There is also a growing appreciation that Australian agriculture is likely to be profoundly affected by climate change and the political response to climate change. Four reasons for taking immediate action on these concerns are suggested. There are moral (human rights to food) and economic (having a productive workforce) reasons and two practical reasons; as a rich country Australia has the ability to experiment to find better arrangements within the social-ecological system, and trends in the external drivers such as population growth, resource costs, and biodiversity decline indicate that these concerns will grow. These four reasons suggest there will never be a better time to try new arrangements to get improved outcomes for Australians and the environment that supports them. New arrangements in the social-ecological system need to address three major issues; people's access to food and equity, about how food is produced and traded, and how the land use planning processes could protect the long-term viability of food production, particularly around major Australian cities. The chapter concludes with a summary of each chapter in the book. The chapters are grouped into three sections that address the major issues in food security and sovereignty in Australia; (1) food equity and access, (2) food production and trade, and (3) land use planning. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

As the world population increases, pressure on soil also increases and the natural capital of soil faces continuing decline. International policy makers have recognized this and a range of initiatives to address it have emerged over recent years. However, a gap remains between what the science tells us about soil and its role in underpinning ecological and human sustainable development, and existing policy instruments for sustainable development. Functioning soil is necessary for ecosystem service delivery, climate change abatement, food and fiber production and fresh water storage. Yet key policy instruments and initiatives for sustainable development have under-recognized the role of soil in addressing major challenges including food and water security, biodiversity loss, climate change and energy sustainability. Soil science has not been sufficiently translated to policy for sustainable development. Two underlying reasons for this are explored and the new concept of soil security is proposed to bridge the science-policy divide. Soil security is explored as a conceptual framework that could be used as the basis for a soil policy framework with soil carbon as an exemplar indicator. © 2013 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887618278

For soil bacteria, availability of organic matter is one such resource known to influence diversity and community structure. Here we describe the influence of environmental gradients on soil bacterial communities of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, a model ecosystem that hosts simple, microbially-dominated foodwebs believed to be primarily structured by abiotic drivers such as water, organic matter, pH, and electrical conductivity. We sampled 48 locations exhibiting orders of magnitude ranges in primary production and soil geochemistry (pH and electrical conductivity) over local and regional scales. Our findings show that environmental gradients imposed by cryptogam productivity and regional variation in geochemistry influence the diversity and structure of soil bacterial communities. Responses of soil bacterial richness to carbon content illustrate a productivity-diversity relationship, while bacterial community structure primarily responds to soil pH and electrical conductivity. This diversity response to resource availability and a community structure response to environmental severity suggests a need for careful consideration of how microbial communities and associated functions may respond to shifting environmental conditions resulting from human activity and climate variability. © 2013 Geyer et al.","Antarctic Dry Valleys; Biogeography; Environmental gradients; Microbial ecology; Productivity/diversity theory",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901001124

Based on a review of recent literature including geographically explicit simulation studies with the process-based LPJmL global biosphere model, it demonstrates that the connectivity of water and vegetation dynamics is vital for water security, food security and (terrestrial) ecosystem dynamics alike. The water limitation of net primary production of both natural and agricultural plants - already pronounced in many regions - is shown to increase in many places under projected climate change, though this development is partially offset by water-saving direct CO2 effects. Natural vegetation can to some degree adapt dynamically to higher water limitation, but agricultural crops usually require some form of active management to overcome it - among them irrigation, soil conservation and eventually shifts of cropland to areas that are less water-limited due to more favourable climatic conditions. While crucial to secure food production for a growing world population, such human interventions in water-vegetation systems have, as also shown, repercussions on the water cycle. Indeed, land use changes are shown to be the second-most important influence on the terrestrial water balance in recent times. Furthermore, climate change (warming and precipitation changes) will in many regions increase irrigation demand and decrease water availability, impeding rainfed and irrigated food production (if not CO2 effects counterbalance this impact - which is unlikely at least in poorly managed systems).

It is an agricultural country with mostly steeply sloping land that was cleared of forest to become cropland - principally for food crops to support the rapidly increasing population. Over time, soil loss and nutrient depletion have reduced the productivity of the land. Innovative approaches that provide soil protection and improve both livelihoods and human nutrition have been trialled. This chapter summarizes the results of some of them. Key Points The Philippines, one of the largest island-groups in the world with 7,107 islands and islets, is strategically located within the area of nations that sweeps southeast from Mainland Asia across the equator to Australia. Approximately 27.3 % of the Philippines is vulnerable to drought, alternating with yearly floods and typhoons, causing serious land degradation and declining land productivity. These are provinces located in Type 1 climate, which are typhoon and drought prone and are generally vulnerable to El Nino - 6.60 million hectares are in Luzon, 1.41 million hectares (Mha) in the Visayas. There are specific provinces in Mindanao that are likewise becoming vulnerable to seasonal dryness caused by natural drought and El Nino phenomenon. It is estimated that soil erosion carries away a volume of soil 1 m deep over 200,000 ha a year. On-site soil fertility losses in the Philippines due to unsustainable land management, as per 1989 World Bank estimates, is to be around US$ 100 M, equal to one per cent of Philippine GDP per year. The quality and management of land resources in the Philippines has become of serious concern because of exponentially increasing population and the need to expand agricultural production to marginal areas while ironically converting prime agricultural lands to non-agricultural uses. Acknowledging the Philippines' increasing vulnerability to drought and land degradation as a result of increasing recurrence of dry spell and alternating incidence of El Nino and La Nina as well as poor management of land, freshwater, and watershed resources, the Philippine National Action Plan (NAP) was formulated and implemented by the Philippine Government in 2004. The NAP is an expression of full and unqualified commitment of the Philippine Government in the effective and accelerated implementation of the programs and project activities to combat desertification, land degradation and poverty in the identified drought vulnerable areas of the country. It is a working document for the convergence of actions of the Departments of Agriculture (DA), Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Science and Technology (DOST) and Agrarian Reform (DAR). The NAP is water-centered and focused on the sustainable management of Critical Watershed Areas located in seasonally dry/arid areas, which are suffering from food insecurity. It is composed of two major thematic programs - Sustainable Agriculture and Marginal Upland Development and Integrated Ecosystem Management. These thematic programs have five components - Land and Water Technology Development, Local Governance and Community Initiatives, Data Base Development and Harmonization, Information, Education and Communication, and Enabling Policy Development. All of these aim to mainstream agriculture and rural development programs that will prevent the incidence and spread of desertification in deprived communities living in seasonally arid degraded lands. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The outcomes of several successful projects are summarized. Key Points Like most states of the African Sahel, Chad has suffered from the encroachment of the desert. Traditional herding practices and the need for firewood and wood for construction have exacerbated the problem. Lake Chad was one of the largest fresh bodies of water on the African continent and its disappearance will have a tremendous impact on the population surrounding it. The problem of Lake Chad is increasingly complex because of the international nature of the desertification. Lake Chad is a regional problem East African and North African member states of the African Union and UN must deal with it. A collaborative approach to combating the desertification of Lake Chad is needed to reverse the current trends. Land and terrestrial resources in Africa have unparalleled economic, social and environmental value. Traditionally, African societies are agrarian or pastoral, depending directly on subsistence farming to meet their daily needs. Commercial agriculture holds an equally important position, employing the largest share of the workforce in most countries, and contributing significantly to national economic growth, export earnings and foreign exchange. However, national and household dependency on agricultural output has been a significant factor in limited economic growth over the past three decades. Climatic instability has caused significant and frequent variability in production, and narrow crop diversity, and national and international market failures, have facilitated recurrent economic losses. Desertification, land degradation and drought have negative impact on the availability, quantity and quality of water resources that result in water scarcity. As desertification takes its toll, water crises are expected to continue raising ethnic and political tensions in drylands, contributing to conflicts where water resources straddle or delineate country borders. Water scarcity is the long-term imbalance between available water resources and demands. Increasing occurrences of water scarcity, whether natural or human-induced, serve to trigger and exacerbate the effects of desertification through direct long-term impacts on land and soil quality, soil structure, organic matter content and ultimately on soil moisture levels. The direct physical effects of land degradation include the drying up of freshwater resources, an increased frequency of drought and sand and dust storms, and a greater occurrence of flooding due to inadequate drainage or poor irrigation practices. Should this trend continue, it would bring about a sharp decline in soil nutrients, accelerating the loss of vegetation cover. This leads in turn to further land and water loss from pollution of surface and groundwater, siltation, salinization, and alkalization of soils. Poor and unsustainable land management techniques also worsen the situation. Over cultivation, overgrazing and deforestation put great strain on water resources by reducing fertile topsoil and vegetation cover, and lead to greater dependence on irrigated cropping. Observed effects include reduced flow in rivers that feed large lakes such as Lake Chad, leading to the alarmingly fast retreat of the shorelines of these natural reservoirs in Chad. With climate change, the situation is likely to get worse - less water and creeping desertification in the semi-arid terrain. Declining productivity and soil structure in the Sahelian zones of Chad is exacerbated by unpredictable rainfall and drought, resulting in extreme degradation and desertification. Chad is currently experiencing the greatest vulnerability to desertification, with 58 % of the area already classified as desert, and 30 % classified as highly or extremely vulnerable. Rapid population growth and policy pressures to increase production have forced the cultivation of greater and greater areas of land in all sub-regions, and the extension of cultivation and grazing to marginal areas. Combined with limited application of organic or inorganic fertilizers, reductions in fallow periods, restrictions on crop diversity, inappropriate irrigation, and an increasing use of herbicides and pesticides, this has resulted in the physical, chemical and biological degradation of vegetation and soil. Soil erosion and desertification rates are increasing as a result, and declines in productivity have been noted. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Much about the notion of security has to do with the presumption of scarcity in the resources required to meet human needs. The treatment of scarcity in mainstream economics is in turn examined, therefore, in relation to how each of us as individuals reconciles means with ends, a procedure at the core of the idea of sustainable development. According to the Grey-Sadoff definition, attaining water security amounts to achieving basic, single-sector water development as a precursor of more general, self-sustaining, multi-sectoral development. This is consistent with the way in which water is treated as ""first among equals"", i.e. privileged, in thinking about what is key in achieving security around the nexus of water, food, energy and climate. Cities, of course, are locations where demands for these multiple resource-energy flows are increasingly being generated. The paper discusses two important facets of security, i.e., diversity of access to resources and services (such as sanitation) and resilience in the behavior of coupled human-built-natural systems. Eight quasi-operational principles, by which to gauge nexus security with respect to city buildings and infrastructure, are developed. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","cities as forces for good; diversity; energy and nutrient recovery; green economy; infrastructure failure; resilience",,Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884415852

This is particularly challenging in Africa because of high spatial and temporal variability in the availability of water resources and limited amounts of total water availability across expansive semi-arid portions of the continent. The challenge is compounded by ambitious targets for increased water use and a rush of international funding to finance development activities. Balancing development with environmental sustainability requires (i) understanding the boundary conditions imposed by the continent's climate and hydrology today and into the future, (ii) estimating the magnitude and spatial distribution of water use needed to meet development goals, and (iii) understanding the environmental water requirements of affected ecosystems, their current status and potential consequences of increased water use. This article reviews recent advancements in each of these topics and highlights innovative approaches and tools available to support sustainable development.

Deforestation losses include wildlife and human habitat, and myriad forest products on which rural and urban societies depend for food, fiber, fuel, fresh water, medicine, and recreation. Ecosystem services gained in the transition from forests to pasture and croplands, however, are often ignored in assessments of the impact of land cover change. The role of converted lands in tropical areas in terms of carbon uptake and storage is largely unknown. Pastures represent the fastest-growing form of converted land use in the tropics, even in some areas of rapid urban expansion. Tree biomass stored in these areas spans a broad range, depending on tree cover. Trees in pasture increase carbon storage, provide shade for cattle, and increase productivity of forage material. As a result, increasing fractional tree cover can provide benefits land managers as well as important ecosystem services such as reducing conversion pressure on forests adjacent to pastures. This study presents an estimation of fractional tree cover in pasture in a dynamic region on the verge of large-scale land use change. An appropriate sampling interval is established for similar studies, one that balances the need for independent samples of sufficient number to characterize a pasture in terms of fractional tree cover. This information represents a useful policy tool for government organizations and NGOs interested in encouraging ecosystem services on converted lands. Using high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery, fractional tree cover in pasture is quantified for the municipality of Rio Branco, Brazil. A semivariogram and devolving spatial resolution are employed to determine the coarsest sampling interval that may be used, minimizing effects of spatial autocorrelation. The coarsest sampling interval that minimizes spatial dependence was about 22 m. The area-weighted fractional tree cover for the study area was 1.85 %, corrected for a slight bias associated with the coarser sampling resolution. The pastures sampled for fractional tree cover were divided between 'high' and 'low' tree cover, which may be the result of intentional incorporation of arboreal species in pasture. Further research involving those ranchers that have a higher fractional tree cover may indicate ways to promote the practice on a broader scale in the region. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).","Amazon; Deforestation; Ecosystem services; Pasture; Percent tree cover; Silvipastoral","Bos",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881376754

Currently more than half of the global population reside in cities which influence the global biogeochemical cycles and climate change, substantially exacerbating pressures on urban pollution, water quality and food security, as well as operating costs for infrastructure development. Goods and services such as aesthetic values, water purification, nutrient recycling, and biological diversity, that urban ecosystems generate for the society, are critical to sustain. Urban planners are increasingly facing the considerable challenges of management issues for urban ecosystems. Poor understanding of the complementary roles of urban ecology in urban infrastructure, and the functioning of ecosystems and ecological resilience of a complex human-dominated landscape has impeded effective urban planning over time, resulting in social disharmony. Here a complementary framework for urban ecology is proposed, in which ecosystems interact with land use, architecture and urban design - ""E-LAUD"" - affecting ecosystem and human health, and building on the concept that land uses in urban green areas, road-strips, wetlands, 'habitat islands' and urban architecture could synergistically benefit when clustered together in different combinations of urban landscapes. It is proposed that incorporation of the E-LAUD framework in urban planning forms the context of a new interdisciplinary research programme on ecological resilience for urban ecosystems and helps promote ecosystem services. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","Complementary framework; Ecological resilience; Landscape design and architecture; Urban ecology","architectural design; biogeochemical cycle; complementarity; ecosystem resilience; global change; human activity; interdisciplinary approach; landscape change; socioeconomic impact; urban ecosystem; urban planning",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888054871

It is expected that the human population of the world will increase by 40% by 2050 but fossil fuel and reserves of fresh water will be drastically reduced. Avoiding food shortages and famine could be a major world challenge within the next 10 years. Under these conditions, major changes in policies relating to economic growth and use of natural resources seem essential. Stabilisation of the human population, development of clean and renewable energy, enhanced supplies of water and its quality, increased livestock production, and changed land-use policies, that minimise agricultural land losses to development and fragmentation, will all be needed to avoid declining living conditions at the global level. The health and productivity of rangelands will need to receive much more emphasis as they are a primary source of vital ecosystem services and products essential to human life. Changes in tax policies by developed, affluent countries, such as the United States, Australia and Canada, are needed that emphasise saving and conservation as opposed to excessive material consumption and land development. Extreme levels of debt and chronic deficits in trade by the United States and European Union countries need to be moderated to avoid a devastating collision of debt, depletion of natural resources, and environmental degradation. Over the next 10 years, livestock producers of the rangelands will benefit from a major increase in demand and prices for meat. Rapidly increasing demand for meat in China and other Asian countries is driving this trend. Rangeland managers, however, will also likely encounter greater climatic, financial, biological and political risks. Higher interest rates, higher production costs and higher annual variability in forage resources are major challenges that will confront rangeland managers in the years ahead. Under these conditions, a low risk approach to livestock production from rangelands is recommended that involves conservative stocking, use of highly adapted livestock, and application of behavioural knowledge of livestock to efficiently use forage resources.","energy; food; rangelands",,Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879988534

Many thresholds for human and ecosystem health have been exceeded owing to Nr pollution, including those for drinking water (nitrates), air quality (smog, particulate matter, ground-level ozone), freshwater eutrophication, biodiversity loss, stratospheric ozone depletion, climate change and coastal ecosystems (dead zones). Each of these environmental effects can be magnified by the 'nitrogen cascade': a single atom of Nr can trigger a cascade of negative environmental impacts in sequence. Here, we provide an overview of the impact of Nr on the environment and human health, including an assessment of the magnitude of different environmental problems, and the relative importance of Nr as a contributor to each problem. In some cases, Nr loss to the environment is the key driver of effects (e.g. terrestrial and coastal eutrophication, nitrous oxide emissions), whereas in some other situations nitrogen represents a key contributor exacerbating a wider problem (e.g. freshwater pollution, biodiversity loss). In this way, the central role of nitrogen can remain hidden, even though it actually underpins many trans-boundary pollution problems. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

These modifications to disease profiles and the effects upon human pharmaceutical usage are discussed. Climate-related environmental changes are associated with a rise in the incidence of chronic diseases already prevalent in the Northern Hemisphere, for example, cardiovascular disease and mental illness, leading to greater use of associated heavily used Western medications. Sufferers of respiratory diseases may exhibit exacerbated symptoms due to altered environmental conditions (e.g., pollen). Respiratory, water-borne, and food-borne toxicants and infections, including those that are vector borne, may become more common in Western countries, central and eastern Asia, and across North America. As new disease threats emerge, substantially higher pharmaceutical use appears inevitable, especially of pharmaceuticals not commonly employed at present (e.g., antiprotozoals). The use of medications for the treatment of general symptoms (e.g., analgesics) will also rise. These developments need to be viewed in the context of other major environmental changes (e.g., industrial chemical pollution, biodiversity loss, reduced water and food security) as well as marked shifts in human demographics, including aging of the population. To identify, prevent, mitigate, and adapt to potential threats, one needs to be aware of the major factors underlying changes in the use of pharmaceuticals and their subsequent release, deliberately or unintentionally, into the environment.

The crop contributes about 20 % of the total dietary calories and proteins worldwide. Food demand in the developing regions is growing by 1 % annually and varies from 170 kg in Central Asia to 27 kg in East and South Africa. The developing regions (including China and Central Asia) account for roughly 53 % of the total harvested area and 50 % of the production. Unprecedented productivity growth from the Green Revolution (GR) since the 1960s dramatically transformed world wheat production, benefitting both producers and consumers through low production costs and low food prices. Modern wheat varieties were adopted more rapidly than any other technological innovation in the history of agriculture, recently reaching about 90 % of the area in developing regions. One of the key challenges today is to replace these varieties with new ones for better sustainability. While the GR ""spared"" essential ecosystems from conversion to agriculture, it also generated its own environmental problems. Also productivity increase is now slow or static. Achieving the productivity gains needed to ensure food security will therefore require more than a repeat performance of the GR of the past. Future demand will need to be achieved through sustainable intensification that combines better crop resistance to diseases and pests, adaptation to warmer climates, and reduced use of water, fertilizer, labor and fuel. Meeting these challenges will require concerted efforts in research and innovation to develop and deploy viable solutions. Substantive investment will be required to realize sustainable productivity growth through better technologies and policy and institutional innovations that facilitate farmer adoption and adaptation. The enduring lessons from the GR and the recent efforts for sustainable intensification of cereal systems in South Asia and other regions provide useful insights for the future. © 2013 The Author(s).","Climate change; Demand; Food security; Produtivity growth; Supply; Technology adoption; Utilization; Wheat","civilization; climate change; crop production; developing world; disease resistance; food consumption; food market; food security; food supply; innovation; production cost; protein; sustainability; technology adoption; wheat; Central Asia; China; South Asia; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883838410

Soils with high organic carbon contents can store more nutrients and water and influence their availability positively. Additional, a better soil structure protects the soil for losses of nutrients and pollutions into the groundwater. Therefore, organic carbon is essential for soil productivity and food security. The soil organic carbon pool is a main constituent of the global carbon pools and influences main processes of the climate and environment. Soils can serve as source or sink for carbon depending mainly on the way of use. Soil organic carbon stocks are highly vulnerable to human activities. In response to land use change from natural ecosystems to agriculture and unsustainable management contents soil organic carbon decrease significantly and rapidly. Especially, mechanisms for stabilizing organic carbon in soils are affected. Different strategies are required for maintaining or even increasing organic carbon in soils. Reverting agricultural soils in near-natural perennial systems are most promising. But in near future, economic incentives and political will are necessary to realize these strategies. This is the only way to stop losses of soil carbon, to maintain the productivity of soils and to mitigate the challenges of climate change.",,"carbon; climate change; food security; land use change; mitigation; organic carbon; soil; soil fertility; soil structure",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876583584

The factors determining the predictability of different shocks and hence the prospects for early warning are outlined. Lessons from existing early warning systems for extreme events and abrupt climate swings are summarised. Then the potential for early warning of bifurcation-type tipping points is explained, and contrasted with the lack of warning when stochastic internal variability triggers a shift in the state of a system. The scientific and technological progress needed to improve early warning capability is outlined. Then the framework is applied to the Foresight project on Migration and Global Environmental Change, with its focal eco-regions of drylands, low-elevation coastal zones, and mountainous regions.

Water regimes are the most important driving forces for wetland structure and function. Unfortunately, in recent decades, impacts of anthropogenic activities (e.g. dam construction, agricultural irrigation, industry, settlements) compounded with climate change have altered natural flow regimes profoundly and led to severe degradation of wetlands worldwide. Baiyangdian Wetland, the largest freshwater lake wetland in North China, has dried up on several occasions due to increasing human activities since the 1960s. To alleviate the ecosystem degradation trends, flow regulation was introduced to recharge the drying wetland on 19 occasions from 1997 to 2009. However, the impacts of these actions on ecosystem structure and function remain poorly understood. In this study the Ecopath software was employed to establish two mass-balance ecosystem models before and after the flow regulation in September 2009. The changes in trophic composition, flow processes, and other ecosystem indices were compared. The results show that following the flow regulation process the biomass in the first trophic level increased, while a decrease was recorded for the higher trophic levels. Furthermore, total primary productivity /total respiration (TPP/R) increased by 12.07%, while the system omnivorous index (SOI), Finn's cycling index (FCI), and average path length (APL) decreased by 4.16, 20.13, and 23.40%, respectively. Overall, the shift in indices indicates that ecosystem process during flow regulation was contrary to natural wetland succession. The weakened interactions among organisms in different trophic level will result in degrading ecosystem maturity. Hence flow regulation in September 2009 increased the vulnerability of Baiyangdian Wetland to external disturbance. This study indicates that ecosystem trophic interactions should be modelled before flow regulation to prevent ecosystem degradation and key ecosystem indices should be monitored and regulated toward natural ecosystems during and after flow regulation. © 2013 ISEIS All rights reserved.","Ecopath; Flow regulation; Food web; Trophic level; Wetland","climate change; dam construction; ecosystem; ecosystem structure; flow regulation; food web; freshwater; irrigation; succession; trophic level; vulnerability; wetland; China",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877096962

Less attention has been given to mapping and analysing the emergence of policy responses. This paper contributes to that process. It summarises emerging policy development on nutrition and sustainability, and explores difficulties in their integration. The paper describes some policy thinking at national, European and international levels of governance. It points to the existence of particular policy hotspots such as meat and dairy, sustainable diets and waste. Understanding the environmental impact of food systems challenges nutrition science to draw upon traditions of thinking which have recently been fragmented. These perspectives (life sciences, social and environmental) are all required if policy engagement and clarification is to occur. Sustainability issues offer opportunities for nutrition science and scientists to play a more central role in the policy analysis of future food systems. The task of revising current nutrition policy advice to become sustainable diet advice needs to begin at national and international levels.

It also gives rise to other major environmental impacts, including biodiversity loss and water extraction and pollution. Policy makers are increasingly aware of the need to address these concerns, but at the same time they are faced with a growing burden of food security and nutrition-related problems, and tasked with ensuring that there is enough food to meet the needs of a growing global population. In short, more people need to be fed better, with less environmental impact. How might this be achieved? Broadly, three main 'takes' or perspectives, on the issues and their interactions, appear to be emerging. Depending on one's view point, the problem can be conceptualised as a production challenge, in which case there is a need to change how food is produced by improving the unit efficiency of food production; a consumption challenge, which requires changes to the dietary drivers that determine food production; or a socio-economic challenge, which requires changes in how the food system is governed. This paper considers these perspectives in turn, their implications for nutrition and climate change, and their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, an argument is made for a reorientation of policy thinking which uses the insights provided by all three perspectives, rather than, as is the situation today, privileging one over the other.

To this end, food security must be delivered. According to the United Nations definition, 'food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life'. At the same time as delivering food security, we must also reduce the environmental impact of food production. Future climate change will make an impact upon food production. On the other hand, agriculture contributes up to about 30% of the anthropogenic GHG emissions that drive climate change. The aim of this review is to outline some of the likely impacts of climate change on agriculture, the mitigation measures available within agriculture to reduce GHG emissions and outlines the very significant challenge of feeding nine to ten billion people sustainably under a future climate, with reduced emissions of GHG. Each challenge is in itself enormous, requiring solutions that co-deliver on all aspects. We conclude that the status quo is not an option, and tinkering with the current production systems is unlikely to deliver the food and ecosystems services we need in the future; radical changes in production and consumption are likely to be required over the coming decades.

It is also here where concrete livelihood improvements can be made most directly, thus enhancing the likelihood that farmers will invest in natural resource management (at farm and landscape scale) with slower returns, or wider landscape governance initiatives (covered in Chapter 4) with more diffuse or uncertain returns. Throughout the centuries, farmers have on their own initiative devised, developed, adopted, and adapted ingenious strategies and technologies for ensuring food security and economic welfare for their households (O’Neil, 1995). Farmer innovations such as the plough and the domestication of plants and animals that revolutionized agriculture date back more than 10, 000 years. Farmer innovation is a process through which individuals or groups discover or develop new and better ways of managing available resources to suit their particular conditions. The resulting innovations or outcomes of the innovation process may be technical or socio-institutional (Waters-Bayer and Bayer, 2009). Innovation also occurs within a wider socio-economic and institutional context which conditions the extent and directionality of innovation processes, including the interaction among individuals or groups, policies and norms, and institutional and societal cultures. Innovative farmers are those who have tried or are trying out new, often value-adding agricultural or NRM practices, using their own knowledge and wisdom while also appropriating outsiders’ knowledge (Assefa and Fenta, 2006). For instance, improving crop varieties through careful selection of seed, harvesting rainwater from roads, and implementation soil and water conservation measures, among others, are often carried out in the absence of any outside facilitation or support. Traditional irrigation systems (e.g., of the Chagga and Sonjo in Tanzania and Qantas in Iran), local knowledge on weather forecasting, biological control technologies, production of new pesticide concoctions, use of different plants and roots for soil fertility improvement, and local cures for different animal and human ailments are some of the well-documented farmer innovations (Lyamchai et al., 2006). These innovations have clearly played a significant role in the improvement of rural livelihoods and will continue to do so in the future. Yet while local knowledge is essential to household food security, income generation and risk management vis-à-vis market fluctuations and an uncertain climate, formal research can play an instrumental role in supporting farmer innovation. This is either because certain techniques are beyond farmers’ reach, as in the case of complex crop and livestock breeding technologies, or because researchers have access to a wider range of information and technologies that can assist farmers in capturing new opportunities or coping with a fast pace of change. As stated by O’Neil (1995: 1): Farmers are the ultimate integrators of the information they receive to increase production, stabilize yields, use pesticides, etc. It is the farmer that “lives the problem, "" gains the benefits and suffers the consequences. Therefore, a combination of farmers’ and scientific knowledge will increase the rate of success and identify new areas of effort that neither group alone would have discovered. © 2012 World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and International Development Research Centre.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123129588

On the one hand, people depend for their very existence on a healthy natural support system. Nature provides us with a suite of goods and services which enable human survival. These include provisioning of food, water and materials, climate and water regulation, nutrient cycling, pollination, primary production, and aesthetic, spiritual and recreational benefits, amongst many others (De Groot et al. 2002). The value of these ecosystem services is indisputable, even if difficult to quantify, and contributes to fundamental constituents of human well-being, including security, basic material needed for a ‘good’ life, health, and good social relations (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Indeed in the overall balance of nature, man is far more dependent on other species than they are on us; as eloquently put by E. O. Wilson, ‘If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos’ (Wilson 1985 cited in Jarski 2007: 269). Notwithstanding, the power of the human species to alter its environment is undeniable. Noother living being has had as large an effect on the natural world. Sadly, much of that effect appears to have been negative. Homo sapiens sapiens was the first species to induce a wave of extinction (Ceballos et al. 2010); the previous five major extinction episodes were all the result of natural factors (primarily related to climate change, tectonics and cometary collisions). Even if precise extinction rates are hard to calculate – given that several millions of species remain unidentified and as a result of problems with extrapolation (He and Hubbell 2011) – there is little doubt that losses are highly significant. Perhaps this human propensity to impact heavily on other species has much to do with the way in which anthropogenic civilizations evolved. Early hunter-gatherer societies had no option but to work ‘with’ nature, adjusting their lives to the patterns of the seasons, and planning their movements in line with the availability of resources. With the advent of agriculture, people developed the capacity to settle in a single location, made possible by the ability to produce a steady supply (and even a surplus) of food (as opposedto merely harvesting whatever was available). This in turn enabled populations to grow to unprecedented levels, and facilitated the development of conurbations. Whilst present-day cities have undoubtedly come a long way from the earliest riverine civilizations, the fundamental trends established then remain pertinent – people settle in a location, populations grow, and corresponding resource demands increase, with the result that people need to expand their spatial footprint – and so a vicious cycle ensues. Natural landscapes have historically been big casualties of this process, with resource exploitation coming at a heavy cost to the ecosystems that ultimately sustain us. Perhaps a significant underlying driving force of this unhealthy dynamic between people andthe natural world can be found in people’s environmental ethic (or lack thereof). One could argue that as our ability to control and exploit nature increased, so correspondingly did our respect for nature decline. The use of natural resources is nothing new; in keeping with the maxim of ‘survival of the fittest’, humans need to utilize other species to survive. However, contrast a modern-day commercial livestock breeding operation (including high-density intensive breeding of species, extensive use of antibiotics and pesticides, and eventual mass slaughter at an abbatoir), with the limited hunting kills of an indigenous culture, often accompanied by rituals to pay tribute to the animal which gave its life to sustain human survival. Our western lifestyle arguably perpetuates a conception of nature as a commodity, to be used and discarded at will, and lying beyond the remit of our moral concerns. As a result, we now have a gap between ‘people’ on the one hand, and ‘nature’ on the other, with the former depending on the latter but often failing to acknowledge the limited capacity of nature to provide resources and absorb waste. In this gap, lies perhaps the key constraint to (and challenge for) sustainability. Bridging the gap requires, first and foremost, acknowledging that humans and nature are not two separate entities, but exist together interdependently as elements of a wider Earth system. It is this conception of social-ecological systems that underpins the discipline of landscape ecology. © 2013 Selection and editorial matter: Peter Howard, Ian Thompson and Emma Waterton; individual chapters: the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087681045

They are, thus, an essential component of supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services and determinants and constituents of well-being, providing security, the basic material for a good life, health and good social relations. However, calculations based on inherent land quality classes show that fertile soil (that is, soil free of constraints for agricultural production) irregularly covers no more than 12 % of the terrestrial land surface. More generally, soil fertility/quality is determined by the interactions between land management interventions by humans and the inherent physical, chemical and biological properties of a soil. Land and soil management based on the understanding of these interactions is one part of delivering food security. Even small changes in C content can have disproportionately large impacts on key soil properties. Practices to encourage maintenance of soil organic carbon (SOC) are important for ensuring sustainability of most if not all soil functions. This chapter considers the relationship between SOC and soil fertility and structure, ways of increasing SOC, some disadvantages of increasing SOC and two proposed ways of increasing SOC, fertility and sequestering C: the soil application of biochar and the cultivation of deeper rooting crops. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Crop residues; Crop roots; Food security; Manures; Minimum-tillage; Soil fertility; Soil organic carbon; Soil structure; Zero-tillage","Agricultural machinery; Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Agronomy; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Food supply; Manures; Organic carbon; Carbon sequestration; Crop residue; Crop roots; Food security; Minimum tillage; Soil fertility; Soil organic carbon; Soil structure; Zero tillage; Soils",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948701600

A key component in addressing current and future challenges in water resource management is the development of a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between soil properties, land use/management, and the hydrologic cycle. The soil-water interface is critical in determining the relative distribution of “blue” (i.e., irrigation, municipal supplies, aquatic ecosystems) and “green” (i.e., evapotranspiration) water usage for a given region, and therefore must be considered in the assessment of HES provisioning. The relationship between water security and food security plays a crucial role, since the agricultural sector consumes approximately 70 % of global water supply. In addition, it is projected that global agricultural yields will have to be doubled over the next 25—35 years to meet increasing demand, and that about 90 % of this increase will have to be produced on existing cultivated land. This can only be achieved with a more effi cient use of the water resources and a substantial improvement and extension of water management systems. The hydrologic functioning of soils is primarily a function of their physical, chemical, and biological properties, and in particular the amount and quality of organic carbon (C) present element. The partitioning of hydrologic fluxes into blue and green water is mainly a function of soil factors and processes that control the storage and transport of water, with soil organic matter (SOM) representing a key element. The amount of soil organic C (SOC) present will increase with specifi c land-cover/use changes (e.g., conservation tillage, mulching, agroforestry), and will be reduced or even eliminated by others (e.g., erosion, high-intensity fires), making proper land management crucial for sustaining benefi cial soil properties. The SOM quality is decisive for the fi ltering, buffering, and transformation function capacities of soils. It also controls the mobilization of dissolved organic C (DOC) which has implications on the quality of water supply. Given the increased calls for management actions to address climate change which will impact soil functioning (e.g., C sequestration, afforestation), it is important to also consider how these changes will impact individual HES and water security, and what conflicts and tradeoffs will need to be addressed. Thus, provisioning of HES must be integrated in coordinated actions of resource planning and land management on the appropriate landscape scale (i.e., the watershed). Such a process may benefi t from information resulting from integrated catchment modelling that systematically assesses land management/soil-feedback scenarios. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.","Blue water; Dissolved organic carbon; Drinking water; Erosion; Flood retention; Green water; Hydrologic ecosystem services; Infiltration; Integrated land and water resource management; Land use; Soil degradation; Soil functions; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic matter; Soil quality; Soil structure; Water cycle; Water security","Agriculture; Aquatic ecosystems; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Climate change; Cultivation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Erosion; Food supply; Infiltration; Information management; Land use; Natural resources management; Organic carbon; Organic compounds; Potable water; Process control; Quality control; Reforestation; Resource allocation; Soil conservation; Soils; Surface waters; Sustainable development; Water; Water management; Water quality; Water supply; Blue water; Dissolved organic carbon; Ecosystem services; Green water; Soil degradation; Soil function; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic matters; Soil quality; Soil structure; Water cycle; Water security; Waterresource management; Water resources",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948690050

These include provisional (feed, food, fiber, fuel, raw material), life support (cleansing, recycling) and cultural (aesthetical, intellectual, spiritual) services. Ecosystem services such as carbon (C) sequestration are generated through a close interaction of the pedosphere with atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and lithosphere. Land misuse and soil mismanagement can degrade soil quality, and either reduces quantity and quality of ecosystem services or leads to disservices and creates large ecological footprints. By increasing the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, soil biological, chemical and physical quality can be improved which in turn improves ecosystem services.

Thus, soil quality refers to its capacity to provide and sustain a range of ESs and functions of interest to human and for maintenance of ecosystem health. Provisions of these services and functions also depend on land use (e.g., arable, pastoral, silvicultural, urban, recreational, spiritual). Because of strong interactivity, management to enhance some ESs can jeopardize others or lead to some adverse degradation processes (e.g., accelerated erosion, water pollution, decline of biodiversity). Similarly, production of biofuels can exacerbate competition with food production for land, water, energy, and nutrients. The abrupt climate change (ACC), as an example of human footprint caused by the use of natural resources, also impacts ESs and the underlying processes. Developing mechanisms and identifying/implementing policies for payments to land managers for enhancing ESs such as carbon (C) sequestration can promote adoption of best management practices (BMPs) and facilitate restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems.

These can resolve farmer's problems and are important pathways for sustaining food and nutritional security for human welfare in Asia. The essential determinants of this objective are the capacity to efficiently manage the natural resource base (land, crops, animals, and water) to resolve constraints to farming systems, and notably the integration of multiple research and development (R&D) issues through all levels of formal and non-formal learning systems. Both formal and informal education systems are important, with the former relating more to universities and colleges, and the latter to the intermediate level. Graduates from this level have the primary responsibility of introducing improved technologies and change to farmers, mainly along production and disciplinary pathways. The traditional research-extension-farmer model for technology delivery is no longer acceptable, due to ""top down"" extension functions and prescriptions, ineffectiveness to cope with the dynamics of production systems, complex interactions within the natural resources, effects of climate change and globalisation. There are also reservations on the technical capacity and skills of extension agents, constraints identification, methods for technology diffusion and dissemination, and innovative use of beneficial technological improvements that can directly respond to the needs of small farmers, and impact on subsistence agriculture. Agricultural education and systems perspectives are therefore an overriding compelling necessity which transcends prevailing limitations to waning agriculture and rural growth. Their wider recognition and applications provides an important means to maximise efficiency in the potential use; of the natural resources, increase engagement and investments in agriculture, promote ways to become more self-reliant in the development of crucial new technologies and intensification. These together can meet the challenges of the future and overcome the legacy of continuing poverty, food and nutritional insecurity. Asian farming systems, with their diversity of crops and animals, traditional methods, multiple cropanimal interactions, numerous problems of farmers present increasingly complex issues of natural resource management (NRM) and the environment. Many if not all of these can only be resolved by interdisciplinary R&D, which overcomes a major weakness of many R&D programmes presently and in the past. Improved education and training is a powerful and important driver of community-based participation aimed at enhancing sustainable food security, poverty reduction and social equity in which the empowerment of women in activities that support organising themselves is also an important pathway to enhance self-reliance and their contribution to agriculture. A vision for the future in which improved agricultural education in a systems context can provide the pathway to directly benefit the revitalisation of agriculture and agricultural development is proposed with a three-pronged strategy as follows: • Define policy for the development of appropriate curricular for formal agricultural education that provides strong multi-disciplinary orientation and improved understanding of the natural resources (land, crops, animals and water) and their interactions • Organise formal degree education and specialisation at the university level that reflects strong training in understanding of agricultural systems; systems perspectives, methodologies and their application, and • Define non-formal education and training needs that can be intensified at different levels, including the trainin of trainers as agents of change. The agenda and strategies for improving agriculture needs to take a holistic and innovative view of ways to transform the diminishing resource base, potential of rainfed areas to increase food production, improved yield-enhancing technology application including the use of ruminants as the entry point for development, poverty complex, food and nutrition security, and environmental management.","Agricultural education; Asia; Farming systems research; Globalisation; Networking; Networks; Research-extension-farmer linkages; Systems perspectives and methodologies; Training; Transfer of technology; Transformation",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897007314

The project focused on community-based fish culture initiatives, increasingly adopted in the agro-ecological zones of the major floodplains of the Padma, Testa, and Brahmaputra basin. The productivity of water and fish is used as an indicator to explain this case.We hypothesize that seasonal aquaculture supported by the management of floodplains for multiple-use of water can significantly increase the productivity of rice-fish systems. Recognizing the need for innovative ways to manage human-dominated landscapes and climate-sensitive ecosystems such as floodplains, we have analysed seasonal aquaculture interventions along with local adaptation of water management strategies, including the consideration of groundwater mechanisms. The results, supported by quantitative analysis and qualitative arguments, demonstrate the significant contribution of seasonal aquaculture in improving the rice-fish production systems of the selected floodplain sites. This was achieved through the increased productivity of water and fish and the reduction of the risk posed by arsenic contamination. The study is also illustrative of the diversification in livelihood-generating activities to cope with the extended period of flooding cycle in the region.

The Arctic is notably affected by reduced quality and quantity of sea ice caused by global warming, and by concomitant and forecasted changes in ocean productivity, species ecology, and human activity. The Atlantic has been especially impacted by severe overfishing and human-induced alterations to food webs. Climate change, fishing, and aquaculture have all affected, to varying degrees, biodiversity on Canada's Pacific coast. Past and projected trends in key biodiversity stressors reveal marked change. Oceanographic trends include increasing surface water temperatures, reduced salinity, increased acidity, and, in some areas, reduced oxygen. Reductions in Canada's fishery catches (those in 2009 were half those of the late 1980s), followed by reductions in fishing pressure, are associated with dramatic changes in the species composition of commercial catches in the Atlantic (formerly groundfish, now predominantly invertebrates and pelagic fish) and the Pacific (formerly salmon, now predominantly groundfish). Aquaculture, dominated by the farming of Atlantic salmon, grew rapidly from the early 1980s until 2002 and has since stabilized. Climate change is forecast to affect marine biodiversity by shifting species distributions, changing species community composition, decoupling the timing of species' resource requirements and resource availability, and reducing habitat quality. Harvest-related reductions in fish abundance, many by 80% or more, coupled with fishing-induced changes to food webs, are impairing the capacity of species to recover or even persist. Open-sea aquaculture net pens affect biodiversity by (i) habitat alteration resulting from organic wastes, chemical inputs, and use of nonnative species; (ii) exchange of pathogens between farmed and wild species; and (iii) interbreeding between wild fish and farmed escapees. Physical and biological changes in the oceans, along with direct anthropogenic impacts, are modifying Canadian marine biodiversity with implications for food security and the social and economic well-being of coastal communities. To assess the consequences of changes in biodiversity for Canada's oceans and society, it is necessary to understand the current state of marine biodiversity and how it might be affected by projected changes in climate and human uses. © 2012 Published by NRC Research Press.","Canada; Fish; Fish farming; Ocean; Overfishing","Anthropogenic impacts; Aquaculture nets; Atlantic salmon; Biological changes; Canada; Coastal communities; Fish abundance; Fish farming; Food security; Food webs; Habitat quality; Human activities; Human use; Marine biodiversity; Non-native species; Ocean; Organic wastes; Overfishing; Pelagic fish; Resource availability; Resource requirements; Spatial scale; Species communities; Species composition; Species distributions; Surface water temperature; Wild species; Ecosystems; Fish; Fisheries; Food supply; Forestry; Global warming; Oceanography; Sea ice; Biodiversity; Invertebrata; Salmo salar",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871306196

The double impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss are major threats to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, especially those relating to environmental sustainability, poverty alleviation and food and water security. The growing awareness of the planet's vulnerability to human driven changes also provides an opportunity to re-emphasize the multiple values of natural ecosystems and the services that they provide. Protected areas, when integrated into landuse plans as part of larger and connected conservation networks, offer practical, tangible solutions to the problems of both species loss and adaptation to climate change. Natural habitats make a significant contribution to mitigation by storing and sequestering carbon in vegetation and soils, and to adaptation by maintaining essential ecosystem services which help societies to respond to, and cope with climate change and other environmental challenges. Many protected areas could be justified on socioeconomic grounds alone yet their multiple goods and services are largely unrecognized in national accounting. This paper argues that there is a convincing case for greater investment in expanded and better-connected protected area systems, under a range of governance and management regimes that are specifically designed to counter the threats of climate change, increased demand and altered patterns of resource use. The new agenda for protected areas requires greater inclusivity of a broader spectrum of actors and rights holders, with growing attention to landscapes and seascapes protected by indigenous peoples, local communities, private owners and other actors which complement conservation areas managed by state agencies. Greater attention also needs to be focused on ways to integrate and mainstream protected areas into sustainable development, including promotion of ""green"" infrastructure as a strategic part of responses to climate change. © Author(s) 2012.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Protected areas",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901440635

Agricultural systems are already major forces of global environmental degradation, but population growth and increasing consumption of calorie-and meat-intensive diets are expected to roughly double human food demand by 2050 (ref. 3). Responding to these pressures, there is increasing focus on 'sustainable intensification' as a means to increase yields on underperforming landscapes while simultaneously decreasing the environmental impacts of agricultural systems. However, it is unclear what such efforts might entail for the future of global agricultural landscapes. Here we present a global-scale assessment of intensification prospects from closing 'yield gaps' (differences between observed yields and those attainable in a given region), the spatial patterns of agricultural management practices and yield limitation, and the management changes that may be necessary to achieve increased yields. We find that global yield variability is heavily controlled by fertilizer use, irrigation and climate. Large production increases (45% to 70% for most crops) are possible from closing yield gaps to 100% of attainable yields, and the changes to management practices that are needed to close yield gaps vary considerably by region and current intensity. Furthermore, we find that there are large opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture by eliminating nutrient overuse, while still allowing an approximately 30% increase in production of major cereals (maize, wheat and rice). Meeting the food security and sustainability challenges of the coming decades is possible, but will require considerable changes in nutrient and water management. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It then describes the genesis and background behind the ICCR, which addresses many of these vulnerabilities by demonstrating coastal protection measures. Benefits to the ICCR include improving physical resilience by deploying ""soft"" infrastructure, institutional resilience by training policymakers and enhancing good governance, and community resilience by strengthening community assets and awareness.

We quantified ecosystem-service values to help the largest private landowner in Hawaii, Kamehameha Schools, design a land-use development plan that balances multiple private and public values on its North Shore land holdings (Island of O'ahu) of ∼10,600 ha. We used the InVEST software tool to evaluate the environmental and financial implications of seven planning scenarios encompassing contrasting land-use combinations including biofuel feedstocks, food crops, forestry, livestock, and residential development. All scenarios had positive financial return relative to the status quo of negative return. However, tradeoffs existed between carbon storage and water quality as well as between environmental improvement and financial return. Based on this analysis and community input, Kamehameha Schools is implementing a plan to support diversified agriculture and forestry. This plan generates a positive financial return ($10.9 million) and improved carbon storage (0.5% increase relative to status quo) with negative relative effects on water quality (15.4% increase in potential nitrogen export relative to status quo). The effects on water quality could be mitigated partially (reduced to a 4.9% increase in potential nitrogen export) by establishing vegetation buffers on agricultural fields. This plan contributes to policy goals for climate change mitigation, food security, and diversifying rural economic opportunities. More broadly, our approach illustrates how information can help guide local land-use decisions that involve tradeoffs between private and public interests.","Conservation; Mapping; Private lands","biofuel; carbon; agricultural land; article; computer program; controlled study; crop; diversifying selection; ecosystem; financial management; food; food security; forestry; health care policy; land use; livestock; nonhuman; priority journal; storage; United States; water quality; Agriculture; Biofuels; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Food Supply; Forestry; Geography; Hawaii; Humans; Water Supply",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860830532

The majority of grasslands are located in tropical developing countries where they are particularly important to the livelihoods of some one billion poor peoples. Grasslands clearly provide the feed base for grazing livestock and thus numerous high-quality foods, but such livestock also provide products such as fertilizer, transport, traction, fibre and leather. In addition, grasslands provide important services and roles including as water catchments, biodiversity reserves, for cultural and recreational needs, and potentially a carbon sink to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions. Inevitably, such functions may conflict with management for production of livestock products. Much of the increasing global demand for meat and milk, particularly from developing countries, will have to be supplied from grassland ecosystems, and this will provide difficult challenges. Increased production of meat and milk generally requires increased intake of metabolizable energy, and thus increased voluntary intake and/or digestibility of diets selected by grazing animals. These will require more widespread and effective application of improved management. Strategies to improve productivity include fertilizer application, grazing management, greater use of crop by-products, legumes and supplements and manipulation of stocking rate and herbage allowance. However, it is often difficult to predict the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of such strategies, particularly in tropical developing country production systems. Evaluation and on-going adjustment of grazing systems require appropriate and reliable assessment criteria, but these are often lacking. A number of emerging technologies may contribute to timely low-cost acquisition of quantitative information to better understand the soil-pasture-animal interactions and animal management in grassland systems. Development of remote imaging of vegetation, global positioning technology, improved diet markers, near IR spectroscopy and modelling provide improved tools for knowledge-based decisions on the productivity constraints of grazing animals. Individual electronic identification of animals offers opportunities for precision management on an individual animal basis for improved productivity. Improved outcomes in the form of livestock products, services and/or other outcomes from grasslands should be possible, but clearly a diversity of solutions are needed for the vast range of environments and social circumstances of global grasslands. © 2012 The Animal Consortium.","grazing; indicator; pastures; strategies; technology","animal; animal food; animal husbandry; biodiversity; breeding; conference paper; developing country; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; human; information processing; livestock; methodology; organization and management; Poaceae; socioeconomics; tropic climate; Animal Feed; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Biodiversity; Breeding; Data Collection; Developing Countries; Ecosystem; Humans; Livestock; Poaceae; Socioeconomic Factors; Tropical Climate; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859319991

Though representing less than 0.1% of the total ocean surface, coral reefs host approximately 25% of all marine species. Along with their high biodiversity, coral reefs support the livelihood of millions of people around the world through supply of food, resources, and coastal protection, plus their natural beauty attracts tourists that support associated industries. Coral reefs are complex three-dimensional structures, with an array of habitats and environmental niches. They are also one of the most vulnerable ecosystems on our planet, currently under direct threat from human activities including climate change, decreased water quality, and increased nutrient loads. The microbial community is fundamental to the functioning, health, and resilience of these coral reef ecosystems. Understanding how environmental stress affects microbial communities and their processes will allow us to better predict the resilience of coral reefs during changes in nutrient cycling and disease epidemics. This chapter explores the important role of microbial communities in keystone reef organisms such as reef-building Scleractinian corals and benthic filter-feeding sponges. These species represent the best studied systems in coral reefs for invertebrate-bacterial interactions.

These include achieving food security for a rapidly expanding population, lowering the risk of climate change by reducing the net release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere due to human activity, and meeting the increasing demand for energy in the face of dwindling reserves of fossil energy and uncertainties about future reliability of supply. Legumes deliver several important services to societies. They provide important sources of oil, fiber, and protein-rich food and feed while supplying nitrogen (N) to agro-ecosystems via their unique ability to fix atmospheric N2 in symbiosis with the soil bacteria rhizobia, increasing soil carbon content, and stimulating the productivity of the crops that follow. However, the role of legumes has rarely been considered in the context of their potential to contribute to the mitigation of climate change by reducing fossil fuel use or by providing feedstock for the emerging biobased economies where fossil sources of energy and industrial raw materials are replaced in part by sustainable and renewable biomass resources. The aim of this review was to collate the current knowledge regarding the capacity of legumes to (1) lower the emissions of the key greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) compared to N-fertilized systems, (2) reduce the fossil energy used in the production of food and forage, (3) contribute to the sequestration of carbon (C) in soils, and (4) provide a viable source of biomass for the generation of biofuels and other materials in future biorefinery concepts. We estimated that globally between 350 and 500 Tg CO2 could be emitted as a result of the 33 to 46 Tg N that is biologically fixed by agricultural legumes each year. This compares to around 300 Tg CO2 released annually from the manufacture of 100 Tg fertilizer N. The main difference is that the CO2 respired from the nodulated roots of N2-fixing legumes originated from photosynthesis and will not represent a net contribution to atmospheric concentrations of CO2, whereas the CO2 generated during the synthesis of N fertilizer was derived from fossil fuels. Experimental measures of total N2O fluxes from legumes and N-fertilized systems were found to vary enormously (0.03-7.09 and 0.09-18.16 kg N2O-N ha?1, respectively). This reflected the data being collated from a diverse range of studies using different rates of N inputs, as well as the large number of climatic, soil, and management variables known to influence denitrification and the portion of the total N lost as N2O. Averages across 71 site-years of data, soils under legumes emitted a total of 1.29 kg N2O-N ha?1 during a growing season. This compared to a mean of 3.22 kg N2O-N ha?1 from 67 site-years of N-fertilized crops and pastures, and 1.20 kg N2O-N ha?1 from 33 site-years of data collected from unplanted soils or unfertilized nonlegumes. It was concluded that there was little evidence that biological N2 fixation substantially contributed to total N2O emissions, and that losses of N2O from legume soil were generally lower than N-fertilized systems, especially when commercial rates of N fertilizer were applied. Elevated rates of N2O losses can occur following the termination of legume-based pastures, or where legumes had been green-or brown-manured and there was a rapid build-up of high concentrations of nitrate in soil. Legume crops and legume-based pastures use 35% to 60% less fossil energy than N-fertilized cereals or grasslands, and the inclusion of legumes in cropping sequences reduced the average annual energy usage over a rotation by 12% to 34%. The reduced energy use was primarily due to the removal of the need to apply N fertilizer and the subsequently lower N fertilizer requirements for crops grown following legumes. Life cycle energy balances of legume-based rotations were also assisted by a lower use of agrichemicals for crop protection as diversification of cropping sequences reduce the incidence of cereal pathogens and pests and assisted weed control, although it was noted that differences in fossil energy use between legumes and Nfertilized systems were greatly diminished if energy use was expressed per unit of biomass or grain produced. For a change in land use to result in a net increase C sequestration in soil, the inputs of C remaining in plant residues need to exceed the CO2 respired by soil microbes during the decomposition of plant residues or soil organic C, and the C lost through wind or water erosion. The net N-balance of the system was a key driver of changes in soil C stocks in many environments, and data collected from pasture, cropping, and agroforestry systems all indicated that legumes played a pivotal role in providing the additional organic N required to encourage the accumulation of soil C at rates greater than can be achieved by cereals or grasses even when they were supplied with N fertilizer. Legumes contain a range of compounds, which could be refined to produce raw industrial materials currently manufactured from petroleum-based sources, pharmaceuticals, surfactants, or food additives as valuable by-products if legume biomass was to be used to generate biodiesel, bioethanol, biojet A1 fuel, or biogas. The attraction of using leguminous material feedstock is that they do not need the inputs of N fertilizer that would otherwise be necessary to support the production of high grain yields or large amounts of plant biomass since it is the high fossil energy use in the synthesis, transport, and application of N fertilizers that often negates much of the net C benefits of many other bioenergy sources. The use of legume biomass for biorefineries needs careful thought as there will be significant trade-offs with the current role of legumes in contributing to the organic fertility of soils. Agricultural systems will require novel management and plant breeding solutions to provide the range of options that will be required to mitigate climate change. Given their array of ecosystem services and their ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower the use of fossil energy, accelerate rates of C sequestration in soil, and provide a valuable source of feedstock for biorefineries, legumes should be considered as important components in the development of future agroecosystems. © INRA and Springer-Verlag, France 2011.","Biofuels; Biological N2 fixation; Biorefinery; Carbon sequestration; Greenhouse gases; Legumes","agricultural ecosystem; biofuel; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; food security; fossil fuel; global change; greenhouse gas; human activity; legume; literature review; mitigation; nitrogen fixation; renewable resource; soil carbon; soil microorganism; sustainable development; symbiosis; Poaceae; Rhizobiaceae",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863687821

It challenges environmental health and the sustainability of global development. Wastewater irrigation can make a sterling contribution to reducing water demand, recycling nutrients, improving soil health and cutting the amount of pollutants discharged into the waterways. However, the resource must be carefully managed to protect the environment and public health. Actions promoting wastewater reuse are every where, yet the frameworks for the protection of human health and the environment are lacking in most developing countries. Global change drivers including climate change, population growth, urbanization, income growth, improvements in living standard, industrialization, and energy intensive lifestyle will all heighten water management challenges. Slowing productivity growth, falling investment in irrigation, loss of biodiversity, risks to public health, environmental health issues such as soil salinity, land degradation, land cover change and water quality issues add an additional layer of complexity. Against this backdrop, the potential for wastewater irrigation and its benefits and risks are examined. These include crop productivity, aquaculture, soil health, groundwater quality, environmental health, public health, infrastructure constraints, social concerns and risks, property values, social equity, and poverty reduction. It is argued that, wastewater reuse and nutrient capture can contribute towards climate change adaptation and mitigation. Benefits such as avoided freshwater pumping and energy savings, fertilizer savings, phosphorous capture and prevention of mineral fertilizer extraction from mines can reduce carbon footprint and earn carbon credits. Wastewater reuse in agriculture reduces the water footprint of food production on the environment; it also entails activities such as higher crop yields and changes in cropping patterns, which also reduce carbon footprint. However, there is a need to better integrate water reuse into core water governance frameworks in order to effectively address the challenges and harness the potential of this vital resource for environmental health protection. The paper also presents a blueprint for future water governance and public policies for the protection of environmental health. © 2011.","Carbon credits; Climate change; Global change; Poverty; Sustainability; Urbanization","ground water; article; chemistry; climate change; environmental health; environmental protection; irrigation (agriculture); legal aspect; methodology; pollution; waste management; water quality; Agricultural Irrigation; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Health; Environmental Pollution; Groundwater; Waste Management; Water Quality; Harness",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859217213

Results: Watershed interventions at study sites in Thailand (Tad Fa and Wang Chai) and India (Kothapally) effectively reduced runoff and the associated soil loss. Such interventions at Xiaoxincun (China) and Wang Chai improved groundwater recharging and availability. Enhanced productive transpiration increased rainwater use efficiency for crop production by 13-29% at Xiaoxincun; 13-160% at Lucheba (China), 32-37% at Tad Fa and 23-46% at Wang Chai and by two to five times at Kothapally. Watershed interventions increased significantly the additional net returns from crop production as compared with the pre-watershed intervention period. Increased water availability opened up options for crop diversification with high-value crops, including increased forage production and boosted livestock-based livelihoods.

Here, we experimentally explore the impacts of inorganic nutrients and organic matter on a range of food web properties. We find that these two stressors combine additively to produce significant increases in connectance and mean food chain length. Such increases are typically associated with enhanced robustness to secondary extinctions and productivity, respectively. Despite these apparent beneficial effects, we find a simplification of web structure in terms of taxon richness and diversity, and altered proportions of basal and top species. These effects are driven by a reduction in community assembly and lower consistency in a range of system properties as a result of the multiple stressors.

For example, in the United States, 14 billion-dollar drought events occurred between 1980 and 2009 (NCDC, 2010), with a large proportion of the losses coming from the agricultural sector in the form of crop yield reductions and degraded hay/pasture conditions. During the 2002 drought, Hayes et al. (2004) found that many individual states across the United States experienced more than $1 billion in agriculture losses associated with both crops and livestock. The impact of drought on vegetation can have serious water resource implications as the use of finite surface and groundwater supplies to support agricultural crop production competes against other sectoral water interests (e.g., environmental, commercial, municipal, and recreation). Drought-related vegetation stress can also have various ecological impacts. Prime examples include widespread piñon pine tree die-off in the southwest United States due to protracted severe drought stress and associated bark beetle infestations (Breshears et al., 2005) and the geographic shift of a forest-woodland ecotone in this region in response to severe drought in the mid-1950s (Allen and Breshears, 1998).

Geographic and socioeconomic characteristics in East Africa (EA) and South America (SA) make the regions among the most vulnerable to the current temperature variations attracting several studies with wider implications. Presently, in these two regions, remarkable evidence of climate change includes repeated droughts and increase in dry lands affecting water and food availability for humans, livestock, and wildlife (EA), intensification of climate- sensitive diseases, sea level rise, fast retreat of glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Kenya in Kenya, and Andeans Mountains of South America, change in the rainfall patterns in the Amazon forests and in the whole of EA, and increasing of the frequency and intensity of the El Nino and La Nina phenomenon in the South Pacific that affect both EA and SA, among others. Although these two regions are not major contributors of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the poor conservation of strategic ecosystems through deforestation of the Amazon forests in SA and various forests in EA coupled with intensification of agriculture, land degradation, rapid rates of urbanization and industrialization all driven by rapid population increase are putting a strain on valuable natural resources whose conservation would be critical in mitigating climate change. Adaptation measures have been constrained by climate change impacts. In both regions, poverty is widespread and climate change impacts have jeopardized most poverty alleviation initiatives including realization of some of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Moreover, both regions have a strong dependency on rain-fed agriculture for economic development with hydroelectricity and biomass as main sources of energy. Consequently, adaptation measures are required for all the sectors, but especially in agriculture, health, and energy where the loss of soil productivity, increasing spread of climate-sensitive diseases, reduction of water and energy source supply are already threatening the social and economic security of both regions. Both regions have a wealth of indigenous knowledge and coping mechanisms of various local communities that should be incorporated into conventional adaptation measures of climate change. This chapter describes the main climate change impacts in EA and SA, vulnerabilities thereon, and adaptation measures that offer an opportunity to the two regions to develop in a sustainable way. © 2012.

Rather than with the on-set of the Industrial Revolution around 1800 AD, the Anthropocene may have commenced 10–12 millennia ago with the dawn of settled agriculture. Given this hypothesis, the terrestrial biosphere may have lost as much as 480 Pg C, of which 70–100 Pg may have been depleted from the world’s soils. Whereas most of the C emitted from the terrestrial biosphere may have been reabsorbed by the ocean and the land-based sinks, the depleted C pool created a C sink capacity that can be refilled through conversion to judicious land use(s) and adoption of recommended management practices of soil, vegetation and domesticated animals. Principal biomes for C sequestration, those with high capacity for C sequestration/emission avoidance and with numerous co-benefits, are peatlands and wetlands, degraded soils and desertified ecosystems, soils of agroecosystems and urban lands. Effective erosion control can also avoid emissions exacerbated by mineralization of C transported in runoff and eroded sediments and redistributed over the landscape. In addition to mitigating climate change, other co-benefits of C sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere are advancing food security, improving quality and quantity of water resources, and increasing the habitat and total biodiversity.

Its loss impoverishes the environment and reduces its capacity to support people now and in the future. Impact assessment can help to ensure that development is compatible with the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. These are the opening words of the biodiversity in impact assessment principles formulated by the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA, 2005) and perfectly set the stage for a book that stresses the dependency of humanity on benefits from biodiversity, explores how present and future environmental securities are linked with biodiversity, and stimulates the need to balance the need for conservation with that for human development through sustainable use of biodiversity. Through his simple quote in Closing Circle - ‘Everything is connected to everything else’, Barry Commoner (1971) conveyed the importance of interconnectedness between the different components of the living world. Human activities do not occur in a vacuum but are an inherent part of complex biological systems, such as food chains, and large-scale abiotic processes, such as the water cycle or climate change. This interconnectedness helps us to understand that most ecological systems are complex, making it difficult to come to a consensus on cause-and-effect relationships. If we are to develop truly sustainable economies and ensure the perpetuity of the ecosystem benefits that drive economies and human well-being, we must have a better grasp of the intricate relationship between the environment and the factors that bring about changes. Moreover, we must make sure that available knowledge is used in the best possible way to support day-to-day decision making on large human interventions. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923592381

Soil-ecosystems are at the heart of the critical zone and sustain life on Earth by providing a quasi non-renewable resource that, once degraded, is extremely slow to restore. Yet global change, such as population growth, climate change, and drastically altered land use, imposes profound imprints onto soil-ecosystems impacting soil quality, biodiversity, and food security. Questions emerge about the role of digital soil mapping (DSM) in the context of a changing world. Implementations of contemporary digital soil models have emphasized mapping of soil-forming or SCORPAN factors assuming that they are more or less static to infer on soil properties or classes. This perspective is constraining and does not capture soil evolution, i.e., the change of soil properties and their environmental covariates through time. We have proposed to enhance conceptual soil models to explicitly incorporate the soil-ecosystem evolution and anthropogenic forcings into the modeling process. Our space-time modeling framework, called STEPAWBH (""step-up""), consists of soil (S), topographic (T), ecological (E), geologic (P), atmospheric (A), water (W), and biotic properties (B) as well as human-induced forcings (H) to predict pixel-based soil properties or behavior. We discuss how contemporary DSM can be expanded to enhance capabilities to respond to grand challenges we face at global scale linked to sustainability, vulnerability, adaptability, and risk assessments of soil-ecosystems across multiple spatial and temporal scales. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecosystems; Food supply; Land use; Mapping; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Soil surveys; Sustainable development; Digital soil mappings; Modeling process; Non-renewable resource; Population growth; Response feedbacks; Soil evolutions; Space-time model; Spatial and temporal scale; Soils",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866363371

This is good news, especially since groundwater has been widely ignored, misunderstood or abused, as a fundamental global resource. This important paper goes a long way to raising the profile of groundwater in Africa by providing first-order estimates of the available storage (taking account of saturated aquifer thickness and porosity) as well as mapping expected water yields (aquifer productivity) in that continent. Reliable estimates of groundwater resources can now be set against the far more widely reported surface water availability. The constraints of the methodology used to compile these maps are duly acknowledged, and are well within the hydrogeological state-of-the-art. The paper is backed by carefully reviewed sources of data and a considerable effort has been made to incorporate the extensive grey literature. It is important that this benchmark study is received with the acclaim it deserves. However, the headline - that groundwater storage is some 100 times the annual renewable surface waters - could be misconstrued as implying that groundwater is an abundant new resource, which it is not. Whilst groundwater is key to sustainable development, renewability and accessibility issues need to be addressed. The paper may therefore be seized upon to justify unsustainable groundwater exploitation, or to provide an argument against funding to NGOs and others, for water provision for needy communities. Some constraints that must be taken into account are elaborated here. The conclusions of the paper (MacDonald etal 2012) demonstrate that modest yields of groundwater are quite widely available at accessible depths and sufficient to sustain small communities and their development, but larger yields (&gt;5ls -1) suitable for urban development or major agricultural schemes are unlikely outside of the sedimentary terrain. The availability and accessibility of groundwater over much of Africa, therefore, is favourable to rural rather than urban development. One of the real opportunities presented in the paper is that groundwater should be more widely used for a revolution in rural development. To this end, the use of managed aquifer recharge (MAR), coupled with other forms of rainwater harvesting, can also locally conserve and augment groundwater resources and offer obvious advantages over building surface water storage. The large sedimentary aquifers of Africa contain some 0.66millionkm3 in storage (MacDonald etal 2012); but most of this water (0.44Mkm3) is contained beneath eight Saharan countries (see table 1, MacDonald etal 2012). This includes the Nubian Sandstone aquifer system, underlying Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad. In Libya this immense high yielding aquifer may be over 2.5km thick(Pallas 1980) but considerable depths to the water table make for costly development. Water in Libya is currently being extracted (mined) from remote inland areas for transmission to the coast, from wells typically 300-500m deep with estimated well-field lifetimes unlikely to exceed 50years (Pallas and Salem 2001). This and the other Saharan aquifers are accessible only to a very small fraction of the African population. Groundwater extraction and transmission is possible only with the energy provided from the proximity of fossil fuels; large water transfer schemes are energy intensive and for most areas of Africa not an economic option, having also social and ecological consequences(Matete and Hassan 2005). Moreover a steady decline in water tables (typically from 0.5 to 2m yr) has been taking place widely in semi-arid areas globally, mostly due to abstraction exceeding recharge, with consequences for both human requirements and ecosystems. Thus a major limiting factor is the need to identify whether the stored groundwater is a renewable or a non-renewable resource. In the case of deep basins such as the Saharan aquifers this water can be shown, from numerous studies, to be almost entirely non-renewable, 'fossil' water, recharged under wetter early Holocene or late Pleistocene climates, prior to onset of a more arid climate around 4500years BP (Edmunds etal 2004). Small amounts of modern recharge (for example in the Atlas Mountains or Tibesti) are insufficient to have an impact on the drawdown of distant well fields. It is critical, therefore, to base resource estimates for any development on knowledge of the locally renewable amounts from rainfall and to consider mining palaeo-reserves only as a last resort. Hydrogeological techniques are available to quantify modern recharge (Scanlon and Cook 2002, Scanlon etal 2006) and rates can vary widely according to rock type and landscape; reliance on modelled estimates alone could be misleading. Water quality is also a limiting factor in quantifying usable fresh groundwater storage. In addition to the regional or local problems caused by fluoride, in areas of East and West Africa (MacDonald etal2012), salinity, above all, will restrict the total usable storage for domestic use and food production, most notably in semi-arid or arid areas. Groundwater salinity arises from various sources, including lithologies containing evaporite minerals, residual sea water (especially in continental coastal margins) and evapotranspiration. As a general rule, salinity increases with depth (older waters tend to more saline), but an additional problem arises where salinity has built up due to aridification over several millennia. Playas and sebkhats are surface expressions of this salinity accumulation from surface water or groundwater discharge, but clearance of native vegetation also increases recharge and leads to salinity increase (George etal1997). Near-surface salt accumulation may be drawn down into cones of depression in areas of development. One of the largest artesian aquifers, the Continental Intercalaire of Algeria and Tunisia, has groundwater discharge with a salinity of 1-3gl-1, locally as high as 7gl-1 in the Tunisian Chotts (Edmunds etal 2003, Zammouri etal 2007), limiting water for irrigated agriculture. The volumes of non-saline and groundwater in the total storage therefore need to be considered as part of the storage.

In 2008, the total wheat area grownwas about 224 million ha and with a harvest of 690 million t of grain.The Green Revolution in wheat production, spawned by the development of short-stature, photoperiod-insensitive, high yielding wheat cultivars with host plant resistance to rusts and other pathogens, was able to increase wheat productivity at a 3.6% annual rate in the 1960s and 1970s. However, yield growth in wheat slip to 2.8% from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, and to 1.1% since the mid-1990s. In the period leading up to 2020, demand for wheat for human consumption in developing countries is expected to grow at 1.6 % per annum, and for feed at 2.6 % per annum. The global average of wheat yield will have therefore to increase in the coming years at least to 3.5 t ha-1. This yield increase, essential to maintain global food security, requires a continuing supply of improved germplasm and appropriate agronomy in order to sustain enhanced productivity and preserve the natural resource base of the wheat farming. Global warming, as a result of climate change, may negatively affect wheat grain yields -potentially increasing food insecurity and poverty. Wheat breeders will depend on the croṕs genetic diversity and modern genetic enhancement methods (both genomics and transgenics) for improving wheat yield and its stability. They should conservewheat germplasm, study it, add value to it, and share it in enhanced form with clients worldwide. While changes in plant architecture (dwarfism and harvest index), photoperiod response and breeding for host plant resistance (especially for rusts) led to the productivity gains of the Green Revolution, adaptation to climate change (water and heat stresses, emerging pathogens and pests), efficient input use, food safety and quality, are additional global challenges to be tackled to fit newly bred-genotypes into sustainable and improved wheat farming in this 21st Century. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893023563

PAs also directly contribute to increased resources - for example-in agriculture, through services such as pollination, or in fisheries through the creation of ""no take"" zones that allow fish stocks to recover. All over the world, PAs are established by governments, nongovernmental organizations and private entities with the aim of conserving biodiversity, and in most cases, without considering how PAs would affect the interested parties and their livelihoods. As a result, today PAs are seen as controversial tools for biodiversity conservation, since according to the mainstream narrative, they have caused the impoverishment of the local population through evictions and denial of access to natural resources. Taking this into account, the linkages between PAs and well-being of people living in or around them has therefore become a practical and ethical necessity. It is a practical necessity, because to survive and achieve their conservation objectives, protected areas need the support of local population and international community. It is an ethical necessity, because as it is widely recognized, conservation objectives cannot be pursued at the expenses of people's well-being. Protected areas such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries are physically shared by ecologically important flora and fauna, tourists, government officials, scientists and communities living in and around them. The benefits of protected areas extend to users at different scales, from local people who depend on particular species for their livelihood, to nations that depend on abundant freshwater and global community that depends on nature's capacity to regulate climate. Worldwide, many countries and regions, rich in biodiversity and poor in economy, have been vigorously promoting ecotourism as a conservation tool in their PAs since 1990s. PAs have played significant roles in tourist attraction in many countries since their establishment. Tourism can be an effective tool in the conservation and management of PAs. It can provide financial and political supports to conservation, and lead to a greater understanding of the value of PAs - which in turn can lead to more areas being protected. There is a wide range of opportunities for ecotourism in PAs. Such opportunities are revenue generation (i.e., user fees, entranced fees and donations), employment opportunities, and justification for protected areas, healthier economy, environmental education, and improved conservation efforts. In addition, Participatory development is consistence with planners in the direction of ""with and for people"" planning. Identifying what types of ecosystem services a protected area provides, who captures the benefits, what would happen if the services were lost, who would pay to replace them or who would suffer, is a good starting point. Material and methods: This study is based on a survey to study the importance of Ghale Shadab Prohibited Hunting Area (GSPHA), 30km north of Dezful in Khuzestan Province, from the perspective of stakeholders. This region (5000ha) was established as Prohibited Hunting Area in 2008. Maximum and minimum absolute temperatures are 28.5°c and -6.5°c, respectively, whereas average annual precipitation is about 474mm. typical large mammals include Ursus arctos, Panthera pardus, Capra aegagrus, Hyaena hyaena. Also, notable bird species include Alectoris chukar and Ammoperdix griseogularis. People living in or around GSPHA are mainly engaged in animal husbandry, agriculture, fishery and tourism. Findings revealed that 38% of visitors are unemployed. To collect data and information, a query was conducted in the study area. Stakeholder's survey was conducted to evaluate the importance of GSPHA. Stakeholders were divided in three groups including tourists, local communities and organizations. Also, three types of questionnaires were prepared. A total of 750 respondents were interviewed representing different socio-economic and occupational groups. The respondents were selected randomly to avoid serious bias. The aim of the survey was to gather information related to demography of stakeholders (e.g., age, education and occupation), willingness to environment and wildlife, sustainable use of environmental resources, willingness to participate in environmental conservation, study of problems in GSPHA, and tourism potential of the region. Descriptive statistics were derived to summarize the property of the dataset, while analytical methods (correlation and chi-squared test) were used to analyze the data and test their differences (at 95% level of significance). Analysis was conducted using SPSS ver. 11.5 and Excel. Results and Discussion: Establishment of PAs has been the most widely accepted means of biodiversity conservation so far, supported by national and international agencies. Most communities have developed their identity and cultural characteristics over time by devising and applying a strategy to cope with a given environment, and manage its natural resources. They possess a distinctive form of social organization, and their members share in varying degrees of political, economical, social and cultural characteristics (in particular language, behavioral norms, values, aspirations and often also health and disease patterns). They also function, or have functioned in the past, as micro-political bodies with specific capacities and authority. Findings showed that stakeholders use wide range of environmental resources in this region. Study findings showed that 61.5% of tourists, 78.7% of local communities and 92% of organization personnel were male and the rest were female. This study also showed that 66.5% of tourists, 16% of local communities and 64% of organization personnel had college educations. Findings revealed that 46.4% of tourists, 41.3% of local communities and 35% of organization personnel belonged to young groups between the ages of 20-30. 50.7% of local communities were farmers, husbandmen and fishermen. Furthermore, 38 % of these communities were unemployed. The results revealed that the tourists are varied by age, sex, education, culture and occupation. In general, the number of male visitors is higher than that of female visitors in outdoor recreation and youth groups are more interested in outdoor recreation. The visitors belonged to more than 21 provinces of Iran. High percentage of younger groups and visitors with college education indicates a high tourism potential of this region. The results also revealed that education can play a vital role in determining the demand for recreational activities at the GSPHA. Lake of Dez Dam, beautiful landscapes, rivers and springs beauty, wilderness region and wildlife, Shadab historical castle and living methods of local communities were important factors for tourist attraction. This finding corresponds with the opinion of Ceballos-Lascurain (1993) that green spaces with their landscapes, flora and fauna as well as their cultural elements form attractions for tourists. According to the visitors, the remarkable problems are insufficient toilets, accommodation problem, nonavailability of drinking water, and lack of proper communication facilities, lack of sufficient safety, security and guiding, lack of parking spaces for motor vehicle. Studies on people participation in outdoor recreation found that it revitalizes human spirit, restores people's initiatives of life, and produces feeling of well-being, satisfaction, creativeness and physical conditions. Government can create opportunities to develop the tourist industry based on natural resources and protected areas (ecotourism). Tourism as a tool for wildlife and wilderness areas conservation can be promoted, and from a community perspective it is expected to provide benefits that ultimately enhance local support for the conservation of natural resources. GSPHA's resources provide a wide range of products that are used for income and subsistence by the local communities. The majority of local communities (gt;70%) believed that their dependence to GSPHA is high and very high. Supplying the forage for livestock, outdoor recreation, water supply, exploitation of wild growing medicinal plants, firewood supply, food supply, handicrafts production and Exploitation of sand and gravel are the most important uses of indigenous communities in this area. An increasing number of studies show this type of correlation between household status and livelihood dependence on ecosystem goods and services, often sourced from protected areas. Estimates of the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services can provide powerful and much needed arguments to leverage additional protection for natural ecosystems which are important for development and poverty reduction. Unfortunately, economic planning has still largely failed to internalize the importance of protected areas for poverty reduction.","Ghale Shadab; Khuzestan Province; Protected areas; Stakeholders; Tourism",,Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857286075

I examine the conservation potential of an agricultural landscape in two districts of Uttar Pradesh, north India where agricultural intensification and altered rainfall patterns are predicted to occur. I assess stressors affecting breeding success over eight years of two large waterbirds of conservation concern - Sarus Cranes and Black-necked Storks. Both species had high breeding success that improved with total rainfall and more wetlands in breeding territories. Agricultural and township expansions deteriorated territory quality and reduced breeding success. Sarus Crane populations were predicted to decline relatively rapidly if development activities continued to displace breeding pairs. Black-necked Storks appeared resilient over the long-term notwithstanding reduced breeding success in low-rainfall years. Waterbird nesting habitats (wetlands and trees) were retained in Uttar Pradesh as community lands by villages and by state government via legal provisions suggesting the utility of multiple conservation approaches. Incorporating species requirements explicitly, alongside traditional land use practices conducive for habitat conservation, into adaptation planning and conservation policy will be necessary to retain long-term multifunctionality of such agricultural landscapes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Annual productivity; Black-necked Stork; Farmland birds; Population viability analysis; Sarus Crane; Territory quality","agricultural land; climate change; habitat conservation; intensive agriculture; land use change; precipitation intensity; rainfall; reproductive success; territory; waterfowl; wildlife management; India; Uttar Pradesh; Aves; Ciconiidae; Grus antigone",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-83555161509

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities have increased with industrial development and population expansion, and it is anticipated that resulting climate change might further limit agricultural productivity, through changes to weather patterns and global availability/distribution of agriculturally productive land. Growing crops as feedstocks for industrial uses is seen as one way of reducing GHG emissions and dependency on fossil resources. However, determining the extent to which the development of crops for industrial use will effect GHG balances and provide for a more energy efficient manufacturing system requires the development and use of appropriate calculation methodologies.Research at the Porter Institute has identified over 250 different scenarios for bioenergy production systems using commodity crops. In order to rationalise this complexity and diversity, a modular approach to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and sustainability analysis has been taken. This allows characterisation of discrete sections of supply chains and enables comparisons to be made between different crop production systems, different process systems and different end product uses. The purposes of this paper are to introduce the concepts of biofuel GHG and sustainability metrics, to introduce the approach taken by our organization and to use the example of UK grown willow in a lignocellulosic ethanol production system to demonstrate how GHG emission outcomes can be reviewed for "" new"" crops and technologies.The results show a range of variation, in both growing and process systems and how outcomes such as energy and GHG balances can be affected by various activities.LCA methodologies provide data to inform governments and industry of the potential specific supply chains may have for energy and GHG saving. However, methodological approaches can also affect assessment outcomes. Unresolved issues in LCA methodology must also be evaluated e.g. impacts resulting from land use change. Sustainability assessments of crop growing systems, irrespective of the end use, also assist in the assessment of environmental impacts of supply chains. However, it is critical that data continue to be collected, analysed and reviewed, to ensure that the most appropriate crops are grown and processed for the most appropriate end use. © 2011.","Advanced biofuel technology; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Lignocellulosic ethanol; Sustainability; Willow","Advanced biofuel technology; Agricultural productivity; Bio-energy; Characterisation; Crop production systems; Different process; End-products; End-uses; Energy efficient; Ethanol production; Fossil resources; Fossil sources; GHG emission; Global population; Human activities; Industrial crops; Industrial development; Industrial use; Land-use change; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle assessments; Lignocellulosic ethanol; Manufacturing system; Methodological approach; Modular approach; Population expansion; Process system; Production system; Sustainability analysis; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability metrics; Weather patterns; Willow; Biofuels; Crops; Cultivation; Economics; Environmental impact; Ethanol; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial applications; Industrial emissions; Industry; Land use; Manufacture; Productivity; Rating; Raw materials; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Life cycle; agricultural land; bioenergy; biomass power; cellulose; climate change; commercial species; crop production; data set; deciduous tree; energy crop; energy efficiency; environmental impact assessment; ethanol; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; human activity; industrial development; land use change; life cycle analysis; lignin; manufacturing; population growth; sustainability; United Kingdom; Salix",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958759380

The successful developing and implementation of this strategy depend largely on establishing regional cooperation and a network that addresses to similar agricultural needs, priorities and practices, science based on regulations that should be able to protect public health and environment and to stimulate economic development, regional and global trade, modern agricultural practices, advanced food and feed production industry. The germs of such a regional cooperation and networking are developed by the Black Sea Biotechnology Association (BSBA), established in June 2004, as a public nonprofit organization that has proved to be a very promising example of cooperative achievements. This example deserves to be followed and extended on a large scale inside all Europe and even outside the continental limits. Very valuable information has been accumulated during fourteen years of genetic modified organisms (GMOs) cultivation (since 1996), continuously spreading in a number of 25 countries on different continents, under the dedicated management of International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Application (ISAAA), led by remarkable specialist dr. Clive James. The global impact of GMOs cultivation consists in higher level of productivity and economic benefits, as well as a considerable reduction of pesticide use, a decreasing of CO2 emission and soil, water and biodiversity preservation. The up-to-date evaluation of GMOs cultivation and use has not registered any negative effect on the human and animal health, the biodiversity, the consequences of the gene-flood to the conventional crops, the environmental resources. There are some strong reasons to join our efforts for promoting GMOs adoption in agricultural systems, without any further delay and to improve public perception of biotechnology achievements.","Food security; Genetically modified organisms; Potential risks for human and animal health",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960954641

Pests globally consume food estimated to feed an additional one billion people. Key drivers include rapid human population increase, climate change, loss of beneficial on-farm biodiversity, reduction in per capita cropped land, water shortages, and EU pesticide withdrawals under policies relating to 91/414 EEC. IPM (Integrated Pest Management) will be compulsory for all EU agriculture by 2014 and is also being widely adopted globally. IPM offers a 'toolbox' of complementary crop-and region-specific crop protection solutions to address these rising pressures. IPM aims for more sustainable solutions by using complementary technologies. The applied research challenge now is to reduce selection pressure on single solution strategies, by creating additive/synergistic interactions between IPM components. IPM is compatible with organic, conventional, and GM cropping systems and is flexible, allowing regional fine-tuning. It reduces pests below economic thresholds utilizing key 'ecological services', particularly biocontrol. A recent global review demonstrates that IPM can reduce pesticide use and increase yields of most of the major crops studied. Landscape scale 'ecological engineering', together with genetic improvement of new crop varieties, will enhance the durability of pest-resistant cultivars (conventional and GM). IPM will also promote compatibility with semiochemicals, biopesticides, precision pest monitoring tools, and rapid diagnostics. These combined strategies are urgently needed and are best achieved via multi-disciplinary research, including complex spatio-temporal modelling at farm and landscape scales. Integrative and synergistic use of existing and new IPM technologies will help meet future food production needs more sustainably in developed and developing countries, in an era of reduced pesticide availability.

Global patterns of food insecurity and crop production are reviewed in relation to climate, land use and economic changes, as well as potential productivity increases compatible with environmental conservation. Interactions between food production and global processes make food insecurity a complex problem that requires ID analysis at local to global scales. Census and satellite data contribute to understanding of global cropland distribution. Analysis of land-use change exemplifies research between natural and social sciences. Quantitative modelling of global climate change impacts indicates relatively greater potential food insecurity in developing countries. International food security is increasingly interconnected through economic globalization and incentives for increased food production are required. Societies may not be able to expand available cropland without significant environmental risks; enhanced land and water productivity are the major opportunities available to increase food production. This requires renewed efforts in ID work to design and implement sound and efficient agricultural management practices. Models need to be informed by data from field experiments, long-term measurements and watershed monitoring by ground and remote sensing methods. Agricultural intensification may spare natural land but lead to increased pollution and water demand; reconciling conservation and productivity is a critical need. ID work provides many opportunities for synergies including conservation agriculture at the local level, efficient use of inputs, smarter land use taking into account spatial patterns and landscape ecology principles, and improved water management at field, system, watershed and basin levels. Goal-directed ID research is crucial, since producers, practitioners and policy makers should be involved. Geospatial, biotechnological and precision agriculture technologies linked with models can help inform strategies to achieve sustainable food production increases that maintain environmental quality. Implementation also requires ID work to overcome impediments due to human factors and facilitate adoption by farmers. © Copyright Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2011.","cropland; environment; food production; food security; global climate change; interdisciplinary; land productivity; water productivity","cropland; environment; food production; Food security; Global climate changes; interdisciplinary; land productivity; water productivity; Conservation; Cultivation; Developing countries; Ecology; Environmental protection; Food supply; Forestry; Human engineering; Land use; Landforms; Productivity; Remote sensing; Research; Sustainable development; Water management; Watersheds; Climate change; agricultural land; agricultural technology; climate change; developing world; environmental quality; environmental research; food production; food security; ground-based measurement; intensive agriculture; interdisciplinary approach; land use change; landscape ecology; literature review; long-term change; policy making; remote sensing; satellite data; water demand",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958778529

Our natural and agricultural ecosystems are trying to tell us something. This book pursues these overarching themes connecting to water and food production at global and regional scales. The collection offers a comprehensive discussion of all relevant issues, and offers a wide-ranging discussion with the aim of contributing to the global debate about water and food crises. © 2011 Selection and editorial matter, The Regents of the University of California.

By use of a large dataset comprising chemical variables and detailed catchment information in 1000 Norwegian pristine lakes covering a wide climatic range, we were able to predict TOC concentrations with high accuracy. We further predict, using a 'space-for-time' approach and a downscaled, moderate, climate change scenario, that northern, boreal regions likely will experience strong increases in OC export from catchments to surface waters. Median concentrations of OC in these lakes will increase by 65%, from the current median of 2.0-3.3mgCL-1. This is a long-term effect, primarily mediated by increased terrestrial vegetation cover in response to climate change. This increase OC will have severe impacts on food-webs, productivity and human use.

The ocean, consisting of the open ocean, coasts, coastal watersheds, and Great Lakes, provides food and recreation, contributes to the nation's economic engine, is an element of national security, and is a major influence on the global climate system. Despite its vast extent, the ocean is finite and cannot indefinitely absorb all the stresses being placed on it; thus, the United States must commit to protecting the ocean through responsible stewardship and sensible management. Understanding society's impact on the ocean and the ocean's impact on society forms the basis for ensuring a clean, healthy, and stable ocean environment that can be responsibly used and enjoyed for generations to come. The goal of this document is to provide the guidance to build the scientific foundation to improve society's stewardship and use of, and interaction with, the ocean. Three central elements of science and technology will provide the United States with the knowledge and means to redefine its relationship with the ocean for the better. The capability to forecast key ocean and ocean-influenced processes and phenomena will change how society takes action in the future, much like weather forecasts do today. Developing the understanding and capability to forecast key processes related to hurricane and severe-storm formation, ocean currents, fish stocks, and human-health hazards, to name a few, will have significant economic, societal, and environmental benefits. Providing the scientific support for ecosystem-based management will allow resources to be managed in ways that account for the complex interactions between those resources and other parts of the marine environment, including humans. Deploying an ocean-observing system that can accurately describe the state of the ocean will revolutionize the access to and view of the ocean and increase the pace, efficiency, and scope of ocean research. In turn, this observing capability will enable ocean forecasting and ecosystem-based management. The focus on ocean forecasting, scientific support for ecosystem-based management, and ocean-observing capabilities was born out of a comprehensive community effort to define ocean research priorities for the United States for the next decade. Aspects of these three central elements are evident throughout the twenty (20) national ocean research priorities, oriented around the most compelling issues in key areas of interaction between society and the ocean (societal themes). These priorities, each with equal weight, focus on understanding critical ocean processes and interactions, and applying that understanding toward stewardship and responsible use of the ocean. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The capacity to adapt enables societies to deal with a range of uncertainties. Coping and adaptation is a way of life in Nigeria, where climate variability is the norm and where planting cycles in a largely rain-fed agricultural system are affected by reoccurring droughts, floods and other extreme weather events. Climate change scenarios for Nigeria suggest a warmer climate and projected changes in precipitation suggest it will be wetter in the south along the coast and drier in the northeast. The climate models also suggest more extreme heat events will occur. Resource dependent people, such as farmers, hunters and fishers, who depend directly on the productivity of natural resources around them for their livelihoods, are the first to be impacted by these changes in local environmental conditions. The Government of Nigeria is a signatory to the UNFCCC and there is an initiative underway to develop a national strategy for community-based climate change adaptation. Since 2007, the Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team (NEST) is an NGO has been implementing the project Building Nigeria’s Response to Climate Change (BNRCC). Pilot Projects are one component of BNRCC, and are designed to test adaptation options on a small scale in order to strengthen the resilience of communities to climate change, increase their adaptive capacity and provide recommendations based on lessons learned from community-based adaptation projects to the national strategy. The projects involve seven partner organizations who are working directly with 15 vulnerable communities spanning Nigeria from the Sahel in the north east to the Coastal/Rainforest in the south east. The projects include but are not restricted to: increasing food security by introducing improved crop varieties; testing alternative livelihood options such as aquaculture in order to provide a means of income and decrease reliance on dwindling forest resources; providing fuel efficient wood stoves; improving access to water sources to deal with water scarcity; and tree planting for ecosystem rehabilitation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.","Community-based adaptation; Improved varieties; Livelihoods; Vulnerability; Water scarcity",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911126995

Human communities worldwide have played a central role in shaping nature's diversity and its associated functions. Both natural processes and human activities have generated and sustained rich genetic, species and ecosystem diversity. Within agro-systems this agro-biodiversity performs many closely inter-related social, economical and environmental functions. 1) Promoting food and livelihood security. Dynamic and complex rural livelihoods usually rely on diverse plant and animal both in wild and in different stages of domestication. Different types of agro-biodiversity are used by different people at different times and in different places, hence contribute to livelihood strategies in a complex fashion. 2) Maintaining productive and environmental sustainability. In addition to contributing to environmental sustainability, agro-biodiversity helps sustain many production functions both in low input and high input agriculture. Available evidence is summarized for the following functions: soil organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, pollination, pest control, yield formation, soil and water conservation, impact on climate and water cycling, biodiversity conservation and influence on landscape structure. 3) Contribution on the resilience of rural economies. But this agro-biodiversity has been losing at an alarming rate. This paper identifies the dominating reasons for this loss and outlines the basic methods and mechanisms for the construction and restoration of field biodiversity. After the review of the negative effect of simplified agriculture in the fossil oil driven agriculture and the positive effect of ""integrating human activity with nature"" in traditional agriculture, the necessity and possibility of sustainable management of pests by biodiversity in agriculture is discussed, and the general methods used in construction and restoration of field biodiversity was summarized in ecosystem diversity, species diversity and genetic diversity levels. Based on the knowledge of plant pathology, agricultural ecology, plant nutrition science, plant physiology and other related disciplines, the basic principles for sustainable management on pests by agro-biodiversity was summarized into seven aspects, that is groups heterogeneity effect, dilution effect, field micro-environment effect, induced resistance effect, physical obstacle effect, physiological effect and allelopathic effect. It is well-known that fossil oil driven agriculture meets the needs of present generation by paying heavy cost from our future generations. Traditional agriculture has rich ecological philosophy behind, however it is hard to meet the ever-increasing needs of the society. More and more scientists, decision makers and producers are seeking for sustainable agricultural production systems with low input, high efficiency, and high diversity. Agro-biodiversity can improve important ecological functions. It is a golden key for the stable, healthy, productive and sustainable field ecosystem, and for the sustainable management of pests. For this purpose, we should pay our attention to four aspects: (1) the increase of interrelationship among different crop species; (2) the research on dominant pests and their natural enemies with their biological and ecological characteristics and their favorable environmental factors; (3) the discovery of production systems with comprehensive and sustainable management methods to control pests by using agro-biodiversity; (4) the development of integrated agronomic technology and agricultural machinery to match these agro-biodiversity models.","Agroecosystem; Biodiversity; Integrated management; Pests; Sustainable agriculture","agricultural development; agricultural ecosystem; alternative agriculture; biodiversity; decomposition; domestication; economic analysis; ecosystem resilience; food production; genetic analysis; human activity; integrated pest management; landscape; pest control; pest species; rural area; soil organic matter; sustainability; sustainable development; wild population; Animalia",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863407539

A number of potential human health effects have been associated either directly or indirectly with global climate change. Vulnerability to the risks associated with CC may exacerbate ongoing socio-economic challenges. The objective of this review was to analyse the potential risk and vulnerability in the context of climate-sensitive human diseases and health system in Tanzania. Climate sensitive vector- and water-borne diseases and other health related problems and the policies on climate adaptation in Tanzania during the past 50 years are reviewed. The review has shown that a number of climateassociated infectious disease epidemics have been reported in various areas of the country; mostly being associated with increase in precipitation and temperature. Although, there is no single policy document that specifically addresses issues of CC in the country, the National Environmental Management Act of 1997 recognizes the importance of CC and calls for the government to put up measures to address the phenomenon. A number of strategies and action plans related to CC are also in place. These include the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, the National Action Programme, and the National Bio-safety Framework. The government has put in place a National Climate Change Steering Committee and the National Climate Change Technical Committee to oversee and guide the implementation of CC activities in the country. Recognizing the adverse impacts of natural disasters and calamities, the government established a Disaster Management Division under the Prime Minister's Office. Epidemic Preparedness and Response Unit of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare is responsible for emergency preparedness, mostly disease outbreaks. However, specific climate changes associated with human health issues are poorly addressed in the MoHSW strategies and the national health research priorities. In conclusion, CC threatens to slow, halt or reverses the progress the country has made or is making to achieve its national and millennium development goals. It is therefore important that Tanzania prepares itself to appropriately address CC impact on human health. It is equally important that policy makers and other stakeholders are engaged in a process to update and adapt priorities, mobilize resources and build interdisciplinary research and implementation capacity on climate change and its mitigation.","Adaptation; Climate change; Diseases; Health; Health systems; Mitigation; Policy; Tanzania","adaptation; African trypanosomiasis; biodiversity; biosafety; cholera; climate change; dengue; diarrhea; disease transmission; drought; ecosystem; emergency care; environmental health; environmental management; environmental planning; food safety; food security; geographic distribution; health care policy; health service; human; incidence; infection; infection control; landslide; leptospirosis; life cycle; malaria; malnutrition; molecular dynamics; morbidity; mortality; natural disaster; plague; population dynamics; prevalence; review; Rift Valley fever; risk assessment; schistosomiasis haematobia; schistosomiasis mansoni; seasonal variation; social welfare; Tanzania; temperature dependence; urbanization; warming",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859467020

Feeding the world at a time of climate change, environmental degradation, increasing human population and demand for finite resources requires sustainable ecosystem management and equitable governance. Ecosystem degradation undermines food production and the availability of clean water, hence threatening human health, livelihoods and ultimately societal stability. Degradation also increases the vulnerability of populations to the consequences of natural disasters and climate change impacts. With 10 million people dying from hunger each year, the linkages between ecosystems and food security are important to recognize. Though we all depend on ecosystems for our food and water, about seventy per cent of the estimated 1.1 billion people in poverty around the world live in rural areas and depend directly on the productivity of ecosystems for their livelihoods. Healthy ecosystems provide a diverse range of food sources and support entire agricultural systems, but their value to food security and sustainable livelihoods are often undervalued or ignored. There is an urgent need for increased financial investment for integrating ecosystem management with food security and poverty alleviation priorities. As the world's leaders worked towards a new international climate change agenda in Cancun, Mexico, 29 November-10 December 2010 (UNFCCC COP16), it was clear that without a deep and decisive post-2012 agreement and major concerted effort to reduce the food crisis, the Millennium Development Goals will not be attained. Political commitment at the highest level will be needed to raise the profile of ecosystems on the global food agenda. It is recommended that full recognition and promotion be given of the linkages between healthy, protected ecosystems and global food security; that sufficient resources be allocated for improved ecosystem valuation, protection, management and restoration; and that ecosystem management be integrated in climate change and food security portfolios. We will not be able to feed the world and eradicate extreme poverty, if we do not protect our valuable ecosystems and biodiversity. © 2011 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem services; Food security; Millennium development goals; Poverty",,Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858217502

Literature covering six main impact sectors is reviewed: sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal impacts, ocean acidification, ecosystems and biodiversity, water resources and desertification, agriculture and food security, and human health. The review focuses on studies with a global perspective to climate change impacts assessment, although in the absence of global studies for some sectors or aspects of impacts, national and regional studies are cited. The review highlights three major emerging themes which are of importance for the policy- and decision-making process: (1) a movement towards probabilistic methods of impacts assessment and/or the consideration of climate modelling uncertainty; (2) a move towards assessing potential impacts that could be avoided under different climate change mitigation scenarios relative to a business-as-usual reference scenario; and (3) uncertainties that remain in understanding the relationship between climate and natural or human systems. Whether recent impact assessments show a changed risk of damage to human or natural systems since the AR4 depends upon the impact sector; whether the assessments are robust or not (i.e. will stand the test of time) requires additional expert judgement.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) has the important role of monitoring the development process and its environmental impact in a perspective of sustainable development and to devise suitable regulatory structures to achieve the desired results. While this role is crucial, environmental objectives can only be achieved if environmental concerns are internalized in policy making in a large number of sectors. This would require sharing of responsibility at all levels of government and across sectors with respect to monitoring of pollution, enforcement of regulations and development of programmes for mitigation and abatement. The Eleventh Five Year Plan of India has taken the due note of the concerns in terms of threat to food security due to degradation of land, forest and overexploitation of groundwater, lack of access of the community to basic services particularly energy, drinking water, sanitation facilities, low level of socio-economic development, high incident of unemployment, stagnant infant mortality and under-nourishment amongst children and the deterioration in quality of life. There is a pathoply of evidence to indicate that poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth is undetermined by degradation of soil, scarcity of freshwater, over-exploitation of costal ecosystems, loss of forest cover, biodiversity as genetic, species and ecosystem level, and long term change in the climate. The Eleventh Plan, therefore, marks a paradigm shift as it visualizes that economic growth alone is not the objective of national planning and the development objective not to be GDP of per capita income, and to promote grater participation of the community in the decision making process. The eleventh plan has indicated the monitorable targets as indicators of human development as well as the human welfare as the determinant factor of the development strategy. The study of provisions regarding protection of the environment in XI th Five Year Plan reveals that definitely some attempts will be made in Indian economy to protect the environment. But it seems those are not adequate. Some additional provisions and efforts are necessary. This plan does not much talk on the problem of air pollution and noise pollution, which are very much important in urban areas and have very bad consequences. The plan also does not consider what can be role of the private, cooperative sectors and NGOs in the protection of the environment. Likewise, what responsibility a city in our country is expected to discharge concerning environment protection. The plan also lacks in providing for the problems of climate change and global warming.","Eleventh Five-Year Plan; Environment protection; MoEF CPCB; Sustainable development","Biodiversity; Decision making; Deterioration; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Environmental management; Food supply; Forestry; Global warming; Groundwater; Noise pollution; Planning; Potable water; Urban planning; Enforcement of regulations; Environment protection; Environmental objectives; Five-year plans; MoEF CPCB; Protection of the environments; Socio-economic development; Sustainable economic growth; Sustainable development; atmospheric pollution; climate change; development strategy; economic growth; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; food security; Gross Domestic Product; human development index; law enforcement; monitoring system; national planning; noise pollution; nongovernmental organization; policy making; pollution monitoring; poverty alleviation; sustainable development; unemployment; urban area; visualization; water use; India",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953106245

Evidence from two sites close to the southern margin of the Yangtze delta and separated by what is now Hangzhou Bay attests the critical importance to early attempts at food production of access to freshwater resources. More readily, if episodically, available freshwater resources during the early to mid-Holocene on the Hangjiahu plain may have encouraged an early reliance on rice-based agriculture, which in turn facilitated the accumulation of agricultural surpluses and cultural diversification. Cultural change was relatively attenuated and human population pressures possibly lower on the Ningshao plain, seemingly because of much more profound environmental impacts of variations in local hydrological conditions, and because predominantly saline conditions, associated with rising relative sea level, hampered the early development of irrigated agriculture. The evidence, although largely dating to the early and middle parts of the Holocene, provides a timely warning of the complexity of vulnerability to climate change-induced processes of agriculture, and indeed human activities more generally, on megadeltas in Asia. © 2010 University of Washington.","Environmental change; Food security; Holocene; Phytolith; Pollen; Rice; Sea level","Environmental change; Food security; Holocenes; Phytolith; Pollen; Rice; Agriculture; Algae; Charcoal; Environmental impact; Food supply; Sea level; Climate change; agriculture; environmental change; food security; freshwater ecosystem; Holocene; human activity; Neolithic; phytolith; rice; vulnerability; China; Yangtze Delta; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Dinophyceae",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-78751569867

Fish and crab are abundant in the Bering Sea; whales, seals, and seabirds migrate there every year. In winter, the topography, latitude, atmosphere, and ocean circulation combine to produce a sea ice advance in the Bering Sea unmatched elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, and in spring the retreating ice; longer daylight hours; and nutrient-rich, deep-ocean waters forced up onto the broad continental shelf result in intense marine productivity (Figure 1). This seasonal ice cover is a major driver of Bering Sea ecology, making this ecosystem particularly sensitive to changes in climate. Predicted changes in ice cover in the coming decades have intensified concern about the future of this economically and culturally important region. In response, the North Pacific Research Board (NPRB) and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) entered into a partnership in 2007 to support the Bering Sea Project, a comprehensive $52 million investigation to understand how climate change is affecting the Bering Sea ecosystem, ranging from lower trophic levels (e.g., plankton) to fish, seabirds, marine mammals, and, ultimately, humans. The project integrates two research programs, the NSF Bering Ecosystem Study (BEST) and the NPRB Bering Sea Integrated Ecosystem Research Program (BSIERP), with substantial in-kind contributions from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",,"climate change; climate effect; commercial species; development project; ecological impact; ecosystem response; fishery production; ice cover; marine ecosystem; Northern Hemisphere; research program; socioeconomic impact; spring (season); winter; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean; Cetacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Mammalia",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650281277

The ways in which we eat and drink are part of human culture. At the same time, the production of food is closely linked with the natural environment and ecological cycles, demonstrating our dependence on nature. Altogether, food production and consumption form a complex system that is an integral part of our daily life. Agriculture and food production are integrated into a multi-level system of markets, flows and actor networks. On a global scale, they have changed considerably over the last 50 years. Agricultural production and yields have been increasing due to the expansion of arable and irrigated land and the intensification, even industrialisation, of farming. International competition demands low prices, large volumes, standardisation, specialisation and high production efficiency from agricultural systems (Morgan et al. 2006). The globalisation of food markets has intensified long distance trade, resulting in complex commodity-flow and division of labour systems (cf. the shrimp industry, Chapter 7 in this volume). As a consequence of these developments, many countries have increased their food security. In industrialised countries especially, an outstanding variety of food is available at low prices. On the other hand, agricultural intensification causes overexploitation and negative effects, such as soil degradation, water pollution, loss of biodiversity, climate change, and reduced standards of animal welfare (Knudsen et al. 2006). In 2009, about one billion people, mainly in developing countries, suffer from malnutrition, whereas in richer social sectors over-consumption and unhealthy diets are contributing to an increase of endemic illnesses, such as obesity or cardiovascular diseases. Food production and consumption are being exposed to structural changes, but these are not necessarily sustainable. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892363621

Biomass burning and the removal of crop residues reduce carbon in soil and vegetation, which has implications for soil fertility and the global carbon cycle. Pyrolysis of waste biomass generates fuels and biochar (charcoal) recalcitrant against decomposition. The process of pyrolysis or carbonization is known globally. It can be implemented on a small scale (e.g., cooking stove) as well as a large scale (e.g., biorefinery) and in most agricultural systems. Biochar offers unique options to address issues emerging from the conflicts and complementarities between cultivating crops for different purposes, such as for energy or for CO2 sequestration or for food and the impacts on food security, soil degradation, water, and biodiversity. Biochar is proposed as a soil amendment in environments with low carbon sequestration capacity and previously carbon-depleted soils (especially in the Tropics). From recent studies it is known that biochar amendments to soil increase and maintain fertility and the human-made Terra Preta soils in the Amazon prove that infertile soils can be transformed into fertile soils and long-term SOC enrichment is feasible even in environments with low carbon sequestration capacity. The prospects are to increase the sustainability of land use, establish a large carbon sink, reducing the rate of deforestation and competition between different land use purposes through waste biomass utilization. This chapter reviews the potential of waste biomass utilizations, the importance of the soil organic carbon pool for climate and explains our options to manage this carbon pool by biochar carbon sequestration. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Based on field experimental data in September and October 2009, two mass-balance models of the Baiyangdian Lake were developed to compare differences in energy flow process, trophic composition and other system character indexes during this two periods. As the results show, from September to October, the biomass proportion of first trophic level distinctively increased but in higher trophic level this proportion declined, meanwhile the total primary productivity/total respiration (TPP/R) increased by 12.07%, the system omnivorous coefficient (SOI), Finn's cycling index (FCI), and the average path length decreased by 4.16%, 20.13%, and 23.4% respectively. Most of the change directions of the indexes are contrary to the natural processes of ecosystem development, which meant that the interactions of organics are weakened, system maturity is degraded further and the ecosystem became more vulnerable to external disturbance after this time of anthropogenic water compensation. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Baiyangdian wetland; Ecopath; Food web structure; Water compensation","Average path length; Baiyangdian wetland; Current situation; Drying-up; Ecopath; Ecosystem development; Ecosystem levels; Energy flow; Experimental data; External disturbances; Food webs; Fresh water lakes; Hebei Province; Human activities; Mass balance; Natural process; North China; Organics; Trophic interactions; Trophic level; Water compensation; Ecosystems; Information science; Lakes; Wetlands; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951780689

Biological responses to these effects are visible but uncertain. The diversity and productivity of marine ecosystems are extremely important in preserving the health of the marine and terrestrial environment, and provides important sources of food for humans and animals, for the pharmaceutical industry, medicine, as well as for additives in the food industry and cosmetics, etc. The importance of the macrobenthic flora - algae and phanerogames - for the general productivity of the marine environment, especially in shallow waters, is becoming more and more obvious from the biological, as well as from the economical point of view. The macrophytes also represent a particular life form in aquatic wather. During the past years, it became obvious that the ecosystem marin presents a marine algae exceedence, which should be turned valuable in one way or another. Marine algae are a heterogenic group of organisms that is comprised of aprox. 10 000 species, spread especially in the aquatic environment but also on the solid wet substratum.

Our combined results from climatological, ecological, economic and hydrological studies suggest that, in Israel, certain landscapes provide high returns as ecosystem services for little input of additional blue water. Specifically, cultural services such as recreation may by far exceed that of food production. Interestingly, some highly valued landscapes (e.g. rangeland) appear resistant to climate change, making them an ideal candidate for adaptive land management. Vice versa, expanding irrigated agriculture is unlikely to be sustainable under global climate change. We advocate the inclusion of a large range of ecosystem services into integrated land and water resources management.

The complex ecology of the 1500 km stretch of the Thai-LaosMekong River has been studied in this paper to understand the relationship with the geomorphology, with the sub-tropical monsoonal climate and the impact of human activity. Sub-surface geology controls the nature and extent of the drainage basin and of the river channel. The volume flow of the river varies naturally and dynamically in phase with the rainfall; traditional models based on steady state hydraulics are inappropriate. Continuous erosion of the river banks and bed generates a sediment load of impure silt, mica, quartz and clay minerals that inhibits light penetration and limits the primary productivity of the river. The river separates two countries at different stages of development; it flows through or close to eight non-industrial conurbations (Populations 350,000-2,000,000) but is otherwise sparsely populated. The river is used for subsistence agriculture, village transport, fishing including aquaculture and as a source of domestic water. Hydroelectricity is generated from the Laos tributaries. The river is a depository for partially treated urban waste and untreated village waste, hence populations of E.coli bacteria sometimes render the water unsuitable for drinking unless treated with the highest value of 240/100ml found at station 7 during the summer season of 2003. Furthermore the river is polluted by trace metals, notably cadmium and mercury, and by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are particularly concentrated in the sediments. Previous work has shown that cadmium and mercury exceed the Probable Effect Level (PEL) values of Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines and that the PAH concentrations were also greater than the Interim Sediment Quality Guidelines (ISQG). Consequently the fish stock, a vital source of protein for the local human population maybe seriously affected. As conflict between the demands of human activities will be exacerbated by the continuing development of the basin; monitoring must be continued and a better model of the river's ecology is needed to predict the impact of development.

In this analysis, we consider where yields might be increased on existing croplands, and how crop yields are constrained by biophysical (e.g. climate) versus management factors.Location This study was conducted at the global scale.Methods Using spatial datasets, we compare yield patterns for the 18 most dominant crops within regions of similar climate. We use this comparison to evaluate the potential yield obtainable for each crop in different climates around the world. We then compare the actual yields currently being achieved for each crop with their 'climatic potential yield' to estimate the 'yield gap'.Results We present spatial datasets of both the climatic potential yields and yield gap patterns for 18 crops around the year 2000. These datasets depict the regions of the world that meet their climatic potential, and highlight places where yields might potentially be raised. Most often, low yield gaps are concentrated in developed countries or in regions with relatively high-input agriculture.Main conclusions While biophysical factors like climate are key drivers of global crop yield patterns, controlling for them demonstrates that there are still considerable ranges in yields attributable to other factors, like land management practices. With conventional practices, bringing crop yields up to their climatic potential would probably require more chemical, nutrient and water inputs. These intensive land management practices can adversely affect ecosystem goods and services, and in turn human welfare. Until society develops more sustainable high-yielding cropping practices, the trade-offs between increased crop productivity and social and ecological factors need to be made explicit when future food scenarios are formulated. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Agricultural land; Agricultural system; Climate; Crop yield; Cropland; Global; Global land use; Land management; Yield gap","agricultural land; agricultural management; climate change; crop production; crop yield; cropping practice; cultivation; farming system; land management; land use; trade-off",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958503794

The three species of interest inhabit different marine habitats at different life stages, and therefore can have significant influences across the sea floor at broad spatial scales. The primary species include the shallow-water Atlantic goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara), which inhabits mangrove root systems as juveniles, and caves, shipwrecks, and rocky reefs as adults; red grouper (E. morio), which excavates habitat throughout its benthic life in Karst regions of the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic, from the coast to the shelf-edge; and tilefish (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps), a species that lives on the continental slope and constructs elaborate, pueblo-esque burrows. The anthropogenic disturbances of greatest interest in the Gulf of Mexico include fishing, hypoxia, red tide, oil and gas exploration, and climatic change. We suggest that to understand the broader effects of both natural and anthropogenic disturbances on biomass and productivity in these species requires that we first understand the strength of interactions between them and the other species residing within their communities (e.g., predators, prey, commensals, and mutualists). © The Author 2010.

Amongst soil functions, the capacity to produce plant biomass (productivity function) remains essential. This function is closely associated with the main global issues of the 21st century like food security, demands of energy and water, carbon balance and climate change. A standardised methodology for assessing the productivity function of the global soil resource consistently over different spatial scales will be demanded by a growing international community of land users and stakeholders for achieving high soil productivity in the context of sustainable multifunctional use of soils. We analysed available methods for assessing the soil productivity function. The aim was to find potentials, deficiencies and gaps in knowledge of current approaches towards a global reference framework. Our main findings were (i) that the soil moisture and thermal regime, which are climate-influenced, are the main constraints to the soil productivity potential on a global scale, and (ii) that most taxonomic soil classification systems including the World Reference Basis for Soil Resources provide little information on soil functionality in particular the productivity function. We found (iii) a multitude of approaches developed at the national and local scale in the last century for assessing mainly specific aspects of potential soil and land productivity. Their soil data inputs differ, evaluation ratings are not transferable and thus not applicable in international and global studies. At an international level or global scale, methods like agro-ecological zoning or ecosystem and crop modelling provide assessments of land productivity but contain little soil information. Those methods are not intended for field scale application to detect main soil constraints and thereby to derive soil management and conservation recommendations in situ. We found also, that (iv) soil structure is a crucial criterion of agricultural soil quality and methods of visual soil assessment like the Peerlkamp scheme, the French method ""Le profil cultural"" and the New Zealand Visual Soil Assessment are powerful tools for recognising dynamic agricultural soil quality and controlling soil management processes at field scale. We concluded that these approaches have potential to be integrated into an internationally applicable assessment framework of the soil's productivity function, working from field scale to the global level. This framework needs to serve as a reference base for ranking soil productivity potentials on a global scale and as an operational tool for controlling further soil degradation and desertification. Methods like the multi-indicator-based Muencheberg Soil Quality Rating meet most criteria of such a framework. This method has potential to act as a global overall assessment method of the soil productivity function for cropping land and pastoral grassland but needs further evolution by testing and amending its indicator thresholds. © 2010 INRA, EDP Sciences.","Land rating; Soil classification; Soil functions; Soil productivity; Soil quality; Soil structure; Sustainable agriculture","biological production; carbon balance; climate change; desertification; energy use; food security; pastoralism; phytomass; soil classification; soil conservation; soil moisture; soil quality; soil structure; sustainability; water demand",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955813155

Recent studies indicate that rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations are driving ocean systems toward conditions not seen for millions of years, with an associated risk of fundamental and irreversible ecological transformation. The impacts of anthropogenic climate change so far include decreased ocean productivity, altered food web dynamics, reduced abundance of habitat-forming species, shifting species distributions, and a greater incidence of disease. Although there is considerable uncertainty about the spatial and temporal details, climate change is clearly and fundamentally altering ocean ecosystems. Further change will continue to create enormous challenges and costs for societies worldwide, particularly those in developing countries.

Under the pressure from a quadruple squeeze-from population and development pressures, the anthropogenic climate crisis, the anthropogenic ecosystem crisis, and the risk of deleterious tipping points in the Earth system-the degrees of freedom for sustainable human exploitation of planet Earth are severely restrained. It is in this reality that a new green revolution in world food production needs to occur, to attain food security and human development over the coming decades. Global freshwater resources are, and will increasingly be, a fundamental limiting factor in feeding the world. Current water vulnerabilities in the regions in most need of large agricultural productivity improvements are projected to increase under the pressure from global environmental change. The sustainability challenge for world agriculture has to be set within the new global sustainability context. We present new proposed sustainability criteria for world agriculture, where world food production systems are transformed in order to allow humanity to stay within the safe operating space of planetary boundaries. In order to secure global resilience and thereby raise the chances of planet Earth to remain in the current desired state, conducive for human development on the long-term, these planetary boundaries need to be respected. This calls for a triply green revolution, which not only more than doubles food production in many regions of the world, but which also is environmentally sustainable, and invests in the untapped opportunities to use green water in rainfed agriculture as a key source of future productivity enhancement. To achieve such a global transformation of agriculture, there is a need for more innovative options for water interventions at the landscape scale, accounting for both green and blue water, as well as a new focus on cross-scale interactions, feed-backs and risks for unwanted regime shifts in the agro-ecological landscape. © 2010 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",,"fresh water; fresh water; agricultural production; agroecology; alternative agriculture; anthropogenic effect; climate change; environmental change; exploitation; food production; food security; freshwater; green revolution; human activity; natural resource; rainfed agriculture; water resource; water use; agriculture; article; catering service; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; human; human activities; methodology; population dynamics; socioeconomics; standard; statistics; water flow; water supply; analysis; procedures; standards; statistics and numerical data; trends; water supply; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Food Supply; Fresh Water; Human Activities; Humans; Population Dynamics; Socioeconomic Factors; Water Movements; Water Supply; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Food Supply; Fresh Water; Human Activities; Humans; Population Dynamics; Socioeconomic Factors; Water Movements; Water Supply",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954538902

Importantly data indicating trends in food-borne infectious intestinal disease is limited to a few industrialised countries, and even fewer pathogens. It has been predicted that the importance of diarrhoeal disease, mainly due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death will decline worldwide. Evidence for such a downward trend is limited. This prediction presumes that improvements in the production and retail of microbiologically safe food will be sustained in the developed world and, moreover, will be rolled out to those countries of the developing world increasingly producing food for a global market. In this review evidence is presented to indicate that the microbiological safety of food remains a dynamic situation heavily influenced by multiple factors along the food chain from farm to fork. Sustaining food safety standards will depend on constant vigilance maintained by monitoring and surveillance but, with the rising importance of other food-related issues, such as food security, obesity and climate change, competition for resources in the future to enable this may be fierce. In addition the pathogen populations relevant to food safety are not static. Food is an excellent vehicle by which many pathogens (bacteria, viruses/prions and parasites) can reach an appropriate colonisation site in a new host. Although food production practices change, the well-recognised food-borne pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli, seem able to evolve to exploit novel opportunities, for example fresh produce, and even generate new public health challenges, for example antimicrobial resistance. In addition, previously unknown food-borne pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, are constantly emerging. Current understanding of the trends in food-borne diseases for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens has been reviewed. The bacterial pathogens are exemplified by those well-recognized by policy makers; i.e. Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Antimicrobial resistance in several bacterial food-borne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and Vibrio spp., methicillin resistant Staphylcoccus aureas, E. coli and Enterococci) has been discussed as a separate topic because of its relative importance to policy issues. Awareness and surveillance of viral food-borne pathogens is generally poor but emphasis is placed on Norovirus, Hepatitis A, rotaviruses and newly emerging viruses such as SARS. Many food-borne parasitic pathogens are known (for example Ascaris, Cryptosporidia and Trichinella) but few of these are effectively monitored in foods, livestock and wildlife and their epidemiology through the food-chain is poorly understood. The lessons learned and future challenges in each topic are debated. It is clear that one overall challenge is the generation and maintenance of constructive dialogue and collaboration between public health, veterinary and food safety experts, bringing together multidisciplinary skills and multi-pathogen expertise. Such collaboration is essential to monitor changing trends in the well-recognised diseases and detect emerging pathogens. It will also be necessary understand the multiple interactions these pathogens have with their environments during transmission along the food chain in order to develop effective prevention and control strategies. © 2010.","Antimicrobial resistance; Campylobacter; E. coli; Food-borne bacteria; Food-borne diseases; Food-borne parasites; Food-borne viruses; Salmonella","alertness; antibiotic resistance; article; Campylobacter; Enterococcus; Escherichia coli; food chain; food contamination; food safety; food security; hepatitis A; Listeria monocytogenes; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; microbial colonization; microbial contamination; microbial diversity; molecular typing; nonhuman; Norovirus; parasitism; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; quality control; Rotavirus; Salmonella; salmonellosis; serotype; Shigella; Vibrio; virology; virus transmission; food control; food poisoning; human; microbiology; parasitology; product safety; Consumer Product Safety; Food Microbiology; Food Parasitology; Foodborne Diseases; Humans; Ascaris; Bacteria (microorganisms); Campylobacter; Escherichia coli; Listeria monocytogenes; Norovirus; Rotavirus; Salmonella; Shigella; Trichinella; Vibrio; Consumer Product Safety; Food Microbiology; Food Parasitology; Foodborne Diseases; Humans",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952671243

Allelochemicals function as chemical defences of crop plants, enhancing yields. While ingested allelochemicals can confer health benefits to humans, at higher concentrations they are often toxic. The delicate balance between their positive and negative effects in crop plants is influenced by many factors. Some of these-how environment affects optimal levels of defence, how metabolic interactions with nutrients affect toxicity of ingested allelochemicals-are the province of chemical ecology. These biological factors, however, interact with social factors, and neither can be studied independently. Chemical ecologists must work together with social scientists to understand the overall system. Here, we illustrate such an integrative approach, analysing the interactions between people and the major tropical crop manioc, which contains cyanogenic glucosides. Polymorphism for cyanogen levels in manioc facilitates analysis of how costs and benefits of crop defences vary among social systems. We first show how people/manioc interactions diversified in this crop's Amazonian homeland, then turn to the remarkable cultural adaptations of African farmers since manioc's introduction 400 years ago. Finally, we evaluate new coevolutionary challenges in parts of Africa where people are still unfamiliar with a potentially dangerous crop. Current environmental and social catastrophes have restricted farmers' options, resulting in acute problems in health of humans and ecosystems. We show that high cyanogen levels confer important agronomic advantages, but also impose costs and constraints that can only be understood when biology is coupled with analysis of social, cultural and economic factors. Detoxifying manioc technologically requires know-how, time, water and other resources. Detoxifying residual dietary cyanogens metabolically depends on being able to grow, or to buy, the nutrients required for detoxification, primarily sulphur-rich proteins. Solutions that appear adaptive today may not be in the future, as changing climate, rising atmospheric CO2 levels and decreased access to fertilizers affect productivity of crops and the nutrient and allelochemical composition of the foods they are used to produce. © 2010 Springer Basel AG.","Cassava; Climate change; Cyanogenesis; Elevated CO2; Food security; Konzo; Socio-ecological systems; Toxicity","Manihot esculenta",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952288173

Sekercioglu recapitulates natural ecosystem functions and services. Ecosystem services are the set of ecosystem functions that are useful to humans. These services make the planet inhabitable by supplying and purifying the air we breathe and the water we drink. Water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur are the major global biogeochemical cycles. Disruptions of these cycles can lead to floods, droughts, climate change, pollution, acid rain, and many other environmental problems. Soils provide critical ecosystem services, especially for sustaining ecosystems and growing food crops, but soil erosion and degradation are serious problems worldwide. Higher biodiversity usually increases ecosystem efficiency and productivity, stabilizes overall ecosystem functioning, and makes ecosystems more resistant to perturbations. Mobile linked animal species provide critical ecosystem functions and increase ecosystem resilience by connecting habitats and ecosystems through their movements. Their services include pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient deposition, pest control, and scavenging. Thousands of species that are the components of ecosystems harbor unique chemicals and pharmaceuticals that can save people's lives, but traditional knowledge of medicinal plants is disappearing and many potentially valuable species are threatened with extinction. Increasing habitat loss, climate change, settlement of wild areas, and wildlife consumption facilitate the transition of diseases of animals to humans, and other ecosystem alterations are increasing the prevalence of other diseases. Valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs helps integrate these services into public decision-making and can ensure the continuity of ecosystems that provide the services. © Oxford University Press, 2013.

According to its own internal whistleblowers, the International Energy Agency appears to have falsified information on world fossil fuel depletion-- on the grounds that telling the truth that world energy resources may already have peaked in production and are exceeded by demand, could cause skyrocketing oil prices and stampede the world into a new recession. Depletion of finite resources such as oil, gas, useable water or minerals is likely to impact on world GDP well before the worst impacts of global warming. The two together are likely to constrain world food production seriously, particularly in countries with high population densities or insufficient fertile lands. Food security in these countries is behind the huge ""land and water grab"" by foreign nationals that is now occurring across the developing world. Worldwide, governments have dealt with the recession by increasing consumption to prevent job losses which has increased demand for scarce resources, in order to return countries to growth (or business as normal). If peak oil has already arrived or is imminent, providing public funds to already damaged businesses that have large carbon footprints, is clearly irrational. Historically, global economic growth has never occurred without a simultaneous increase in the use of fossil fuel energy; GDP growth and world oil production growth have tracked each other for decades. It seems that while the IEA expects a steady increase in available oil, recent, more believable, evaluations of the decline in oil from the major giant oil fields that are already in the phase of depletion (e.g. Cantarell in Mexico and the North Sea province etc) suggests that Peak Oil arrived in 2008 and that by 2030 the production from fields currently on stream could have decreased by over 50 per cent (Hook 2009).The probable effect will be high prices flowing on into every walk of life, especially the cost of food with its huge embedded fossil fuel energy costs. This will inevitably increase financial instability and produce more recessions. Although global warming is probably the greatest problem humanity has ever faced the most immediate issue is the finite nature of fossil fuel that has supported the presently high standard of living (in industrialized countries). Without cheap oil there is no cheap food. There is no cheap water, health care, travel, housing or recreation. Without cheap energy the world contracts to using local resources and local activities. As food availability and diversity declines, it may lead to a decrease in the human population. This is contrary to the forecasted increase from 6.7 to over 8 billion people in the next 20 years. Human population increase is often considered the major problem that will impact on both resource depletion and global warming but consumerism by the wealthy is presently of major concern The carbon footprint of multi millionaires can be up to ten thousand times that of the average person in industrialised countries, which in turn is 10 times that of the average person in developing countries and many of the 1 billion subsistence farmers in the world have almost insignificant use of fossil energy. There are around 10 million people world wide with assets greater then a million dollars and therefore have disproportionate effect on world resource depletion and global warming. No politicians appear to be willing to address the problem of resource depletion and yet people are the end users and will be greatly affected as demand exceeds production for many resources, from rare earth metals through to energy and water. Politicians and business entrepreneurs appear to be willing to ignore the dangerous outlook for future generations, being only concerned with their present wealth, health and living standards and no politician wants to be the one telling their electorate that The free market economy and globalization must be severely constrained. Living standards or expectations of, in particular the rich, must be reduced-consume less, shop less, live in smaller homes, grow food locally, recreate locally and give up extravagant travel modes and also non essential travel and so on More and more people will have to cross the line from simply exercising brain power to make a living, to exercising imaginative and also efficient use of muscle power from animals and themselves to generate food. For the sake of peace and equity it will also be essential to lift the standard of living of the poor and mandate birth control in all countries if the floods of refugees that could occur through resource depletion and global warming, are to be prevented. Cuts in their use of fossil fuels should be forced first on the super rich who should pay a high price to pollute the global atmosphere at the cost of burning of fossil fuels (e.g. flying or owning private jets, large ocean cruisers, multiple cars and mansions and so on) However it is essential that everybody, above a minimum standard of living, must make some sacrifice. Few of us are going to do it voluntarily as it means giving up too much of our lifestyles for it to be effective in curbing greenhouse gases to a 'safe' level. The world needs time to adjust to even the first decade of the second half of the age of oil The objectives of governments should be to reduce fossil fuel exploitation and use it efficiently so as to maintain world reserves as high as possible to allow a slow reduction in populations and a narrowing of the resource use by rich and poor countries as society comes into equilibrium with resource availabilities. Traditional forms of economic growth will be impossible in a resource-depleted world. We need new forms of growth based upon intellect and human talent and skill rather than raw materials. Before any meaningful change of attitudes can take place, society has to understand that oil is truly finite - and is going to become very scarce sooner rather than later. Secondly the true cost of the conspicuous and wanton consumption of this fossil fuel energy must be identified and acknowledged and appropriate depletion strategies implemented. No longer should super rich people be able to excuse their extravagant life styles, by other compensatory actions such as planting trees, as their carbon emissions not only enhance global warming but will deteriorate the future standard of living of the populace in general, through resource depletion.","Agriculture; Carbon emissions; Climate change; Energy; Farming systems; Fossil fuel; Live stock; Oil","Animalia",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953806365

The impact on each region depends mainly on the degree of vulnerability that natural ecosystems and human-made infrastructure have to changes in climate and extreme meteorological events, as well as on the coping and adaptation capacity toward new environmental conditions. This study assesses the current resilience of Mexico and Mexican states to such changes, as well as how this resilience will look in the future. In recent studies (Moss et al. in Vulnerability to climate change: a quantitative approach. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Washington DC, 2001; Brenkert and Malone in Clim Change 72:57-102, 2005; Malone and Brenkert in Clim Change 91:451-476, 2008), the Vulnerability-Resilience Indicators Model (VRIM) is used to integrate a set of proxy variables that determine the resilience of a region to climate change. Resilience, or the ability of a region to respond to climate variations and natural events that result from climate change, is given by its adaptation and coping capacity and its sensitivity. On the one hand, the sensitivity of a region to climate change is assessed, emphasizing its infrastructure, food security, water resources, and the health of the population and regional ecosystems. On the other hand, coping and adaptation capacity is based on the availability of human resources, economic capacity, and environmental capacity. This paper presents two sets of results. First, we show the application of the VRIM to determine state-level resilience for Mexico, building the baseline that reflects the current status. The second part of the paper makes projections of resilience under socioeconomic and climate change and examines the varying sources and consequences of those changes. We used three tools to examine Mexico's resilience in the face of climate change, i. e., the baseline calculations regarding resilience indices made by the VRIM, the projected short-term rates of socioeconomic change from the Boyd-Ibarrarán computable general equilibrium model, and rates of the IPCC-SRES scenario projections from the integrated assessment MiniCAM model. This allows us to have available change rates for VRIM variables through the end of the twenty-first century. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Mexico; Model projections; Resilience; Vulnerability","adaptation; climate change; coping strategy; environmental conditions; food security; numerical model; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomic impact; trend analysis; twenty first century; vulnerability; water resource; Mexico [North America]; Bryophyta",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952241970

Global trends suggest these stressors that impact on water availability will increase over the coming decades, and - without action - will constrain opportunities to sustain ecosystem services to deliver the Millennium Development Goals. 2. Although a key 'service' freshwaters provide is buffering inputs from the land system, predicting ecosystem response through observation and modelling is complex because nonlinear and dynamic interactions amongst a large number of constituents operate to regulate biogeochemical transformations in freshwater systems. 3. Reductionist approaches have been successful at unravelling many of the processes and some of the interactions in freshwater systems. However, reductionist approaches cannot provide the concepts or methods to understand how system properties will emerge in response to a changing climate (particularly the changing spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation); to the consequent change in water availability and water quality in the context of social drivers on the demand for water; and to feedbacks arising from nutrient cycling across a range of scales. 4. This study presents a review of the evidence for landscape-scale filtering of nutrient delivery to receiving waters and examines the role of the internal processing of nutrients at critical interfaces such as the hyporheic in attenuating nutrient loads. Analysis of research on the spatial scales and time step appropriate for catchment and water quality observations indicates the importance of small scale and short time step data for unravelling nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems. 5. Thematic implications: leading work in the catchment and aquatic sciences on the importance of diffuse nutrient losses from land, and on nutrient cycling in freshwaters, in governing water quality and protecting water availability, is making an increasing contribution to mainstream environmental science.

The impacts of climate on human health will not be evenly distributed around the world. The Third Assessment Report (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-2001) concluded that vulnerability to climate change is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Developing country populations, particularly in small island states, arid and high mountain zones, and in densely populated coastal areas are considered to be particularly vulnerable. India is a large developing country, with the Great Himalayas, the world′s third largest ice mass in the north, 7500 km long, and densely populated coast line in the south. Nearly 700 million of her over one billion population living in rural areas directly depends on climate-sensitive sectors (agriculture, forests, and fisheries) and natural resources (such as water, biodiversity, mangroves, coastal zones, grasslands) for their subsistence and livelihoods. Heat wave, floods (land and coastal), and draughts occur commonly. Malaria, malnutrition, and diarrhea are major public health problems. Any further increase, as projected in weather-related disasters and related health effects, may cripple the already inadequate public health infrastructure in the country.

Amongst soil functions, the capacity to produce plant biomass (productivity function) remains essential. This function is closely associated with the main global issues of the 21st century like food security, demands of energy and water, carbon balance and climate change. A standardised methodology for assessing the productivity function of the global soil resource consistently over different spatial scales will be demanded by a growing international community of land users and stakeholders for achieving high soil productivity in the context of sustainable multifunctional use of soils. We analysed available methods for assessing the soil productivity function. The aim was to find potentials, deficiencies and gaps in knowledge of current approaches towards a global reference framework. Our main findings were (i) that the soil moisture and thermal regime, which are climate-influenced, are the main constraints to the soil productivity potential on a global scale, and (ii) that most taxonomic soil classification systems including the World Reference Basis for Soil Resources provide little information on soil functionality in particular the productivity function. We found (iii) a multitude of approaches developed at the national and local scale in the last century for assessing mainly specific aspects of potential soil and land productivity. Their soil data inputs differ, evaluation ratings are not transferable and thus not applicable in international and global studies. At an international level or global scale, methods like agro-ecological zoning or ecosystem and crop modelling provide assessments of land productivity but contain little soil information. Those methods are not intended for field scale application to detect main soil constraints and thereby to derive soil management and conservation recommendations in situ. We found also that (iv) soil structure is a crucial criterion of agricultural soil quality and methods of visual soil assessment like the Peerlkamp scheme, the French method Le profil cultural and the New Zealand Visual Soil Assessment are powerful tools for recognising dynamic agricultural soil quality and controlling soil management processes at field scale. We concluded that these approaches have potential to be integrated into an internationally applicable assessment framework of the soil's productivity function, working from field scale to the global level. This framework needs to serve as a reference base for ranking soil productivity potentials on a global scale and as an operational tool for controlling further soil degradation and desertification. Methods like the multi-indicator-based Muencheberg Soil Quality Rating meet most criteria of such a framework. This method has potential to act as a global overall assessment method of the soil productivity function for cropping land and pastoral grassland but needs further evolution by testing and amending its indicator thresholds. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Land rating; Soil classification; Soil functions; Soil productivity; Soil quality; Soil structure; Sustainable agriculture",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901072604

Starving people in poor nations, obesity in rich nations, increasing food prices, on-going climate changes, increasing fuel and transportation costs, flaws of the global market, worldwide pesticide pollution, pest adaptation and resistance, loss of soil fertility and organic carbon, soil erosion, decreasing biodiversity, desertification, and so on. Despite unprecedented advances in sciences allowing us to visit planets and disclose subatomic particles, serious terrestrial issues about food show clearly that conventional agriculture is no longer suited to feeding humans and preserving ecosystems. Sustainable agriculture is an alternative for solving fundamental and applied issues related to food production in an ecological way [Lal (2008) Agron. Sustain. Dev. 28, 57-64]. While conventional agriculture is driven almost solely by productivity and profit, sustainable agriculture integrates biological, chemical, physical, ecological, economic and social sciences in a comprehensive way to develop new farming practices that are safe and do not degrade our environment. To address current agronomical issues and to promote worldwide discussions and cooperation we implemented sharp changes at the journal Agronomy for Sustainable Development from 2003 to 2006. Here we report (1) the results of the renovation of the journal and (2) a short overview of current concepts of agronomical research for sustainable agriculture. Considered for a long time as a soft, side science, agronomy is rising fast as a central science because current issues are about food, and humans eat food.

Water is also vital for the maintenance of the natural ecosystems on which we all ultimately depend. Thus water managers must be concerned with a large variety of issues, including water-related health issues (safe drinking water, sanitation and water-related diseases), the availability of water for food production, the water needs for energy and industrial production, and the safeguarding of societies from the ravages of floods, droughts and pollution spills. These human needs must always be balanced with consideration for the natural environment. These issues are not independent of each other - they are interlinked and thus must be treated in an integrated manner. The settings in which water managers find themselves are highly varied from region to region and country to country. Not only are climates and hydrologies extremely diverse, but the ways in which societies organize themselves are equally varied. Governance systems are based on the cultures, the religions and the attitudes of peoples. They link to the political settings, to the effectiveness of institutions, to legislative frameworks and to financial instruments. Water managers must find solutions to the challenges facing them, considering the constraints of the systems within which they work. Thus different solutions must be considered for different circumstances. Sciences (hydrological, political, social, economic) provide knowledge and understanding of the systems involved. All are essential in informing water managers in their decision-making. Hydrological science is of vital importance, but is just one of many relevant sciences.

Wetlands are among the world's most productive environments and are cradles of biological diversity, providing the water and primary productivity upon which countless species of plants and animals depend for survival. Considerable evidence suggests that some global warming is occurring, which has important implications for wetland system as well as human life and wildlife. Direct effects of climate change on wetlands are likely to be accentuated by human induced changes that will increase stress to wetland ecosystems. The Ramsar Classification System for Wetland Type provides three broad categories: marine/coastal wetlands, inland wetlands, and human-made wetlands. Human-made wetlands are as important as natural wetlands, and the largest human-made wetland is a paddy rice field (130,000,000 ha) taking about 18% of total global wetland, which is second only to natural fresh wetlands. Paddy rice fields provide not only rice production for food, but also diverse multi-functionalities such as flood control, groundwater recharge, soil erosion control, water quality purification, air purification and cooling, wildlife habitat, amenity and social benefits. The economic value of multi-functionalities estimated by contingent valuation method (CVM) and travel cost method was in the range of U$ 9.75-11.46 billion, which is greater than the value of rice production itself in Korea. Unfortunately, there is an indication of decreased area in paddy rice field in Korea after 1990 showing about 20% decrease in 15 years. Another human-made wetland type is a constructed wetland for water purification, and thousands hectares of wetlands are scheduled to be constructed for reservoir water quality improvement in next 5 years in Korea, and their application is expected to be more common in near future. There is a growing consensus that wetlands are critically important ecosystems that provide globally significant social, economic and environmental benefits. Wise use of human-made wetlands is as important as conservation of natural wetlands, which can be a viable element to overall climate change mitigation and can partially compensate for the loss of natural wetlands. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",,"biodiversity; constructed wetland; contingent valuation; crop production; disinfection; flood control; global warming; habitat conservation; paddy field; recharge; reservoir; rice; soil remediation; survival; water quality; wetland management; Korea; Animalia",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954084312

From 1960 to 1985, farmers successfully used technology to increase the output of crop and animal products per unit of land and particularly of labour. This reduced the number of people employed in agriculture, and promoted larger and more specialised farm enterprises. Between 1985 and 2006, food prices were relatively low, and although labour productivity continued to increase, land productivity remained relatively static. However during this period, farmers started to address the effects of agriculture on reduced water quality and habitat loss. For established agricultural products, technological innovation tends to have an incremental effect, working through genetic improvement, the removal of abiotic and biotic stress (e.g. crop nutrition and protection, irrigation and drainage, and animal nutrition, health and housing) and the substitution of labour. Whereas the first two processes tend to be scale-neutral, the substitution of labour is usually easiest to achieve on larger farms. Other key areas for technological innovation include addressing air, soil and water quality, biodiversity, waste reduction, and information management. Over the next 50 years, large step-changes in land use arising from agricultural technology are predicted to arise from the development of new markets for agricultural products. A strong bioenergy sector will strengthen the links between crop commodity and energy prices and will have a major effect on future land use. Climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will alter the relative profitability of crop and animal production systems. Lastly, increased public awareness of the links between food, health and the environment could substantially shift the demand for specific agricultural products. Continual improvements in agricultural technology are pivotal to providing society with the flexibility to balance the challenges of improving human well-being with the management of the planet's ecosystem. Increased technological innovation increases the probability that agricultural land can be used for other purposes, but the exact relationship is dependent on trade and environmental policies. The large external effects of agriculture mean that decisions regarding the adoption of future technologies should be taken by farmers working with other stakeholders. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.","Agriculture; Farming systems; Land; Productivity; Technology; UK","agricultural land; agricultural technology; bioenergy; climate change; farming system; greenhouse gas; innovation; labor productivity; land use change; land use planning; spatial planning; United Kingdom; Animalia",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-73249136029

Their role is fundamental to the provision of food and water, along with a wide range of ecosystem goods and services. Soils are arguably the most complex systems on Earth, and are intimately linked to human security and the integrity of the wider environment. In this paper we propose 18 ecosystem services that are critical for soils and land use in the UK. Soils are extremely heterogeneous and not all soils can fulfil the full spectrum of services required for the future of the UK, so there is a need to protect their multifunctional attributes in order to preserve national and international natural capital. There are concerns that anthropogenically induced changes in land use or management will result in soils not being utilised to provide the functions to which they are best suited. For example, soils primarily suited for food supply may be given over to provide a platform for construction. This is an all-pervading and recurring concern and highlights the importance of critical decisions, thresholds and potential 'tipping points'. Once critical soil functions are lost they are irrecoverable, potentially for millennia, representing a loss of resource that is fundamental to the UK's national livelihood and well-being. Pressures from changes in climate and to the Earth system will bring about complex and systematic change to soils and their abilities to provide essential functions. We therefore recommend national needs for ensuring the sustainability for soils and future land use in the UK. They are to maintain the long-term base for soil science through education and intellectual investment, including communication of the value of soils and land as natural capital; to manage soil resources so that multi-functionality prevails and critical tipping points are avoided; to audit the national soil resource through soil mapping; preparation of appropriate databases and provision of long-term monitoring networks and observatories; and to synthesise adaptable predictive frameworks for soil system science through integrated modelling. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.","Ecosystem services; Land; Land use; Planning; Soil; Soil function; Soil quality; Soil science","climate change; ecosystem service; integrated approach; land use change; land use planning; modeling; soil quality; soil science; sustainability; United Kingdom",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-73249120015

In spite of this, little is known of the overall effects of increased sediment loads on lakes. By modifying both bottom-up and top-down ecological processes and restructuring energy flow pathways, increased sediment loads not only alter biotic assemblage structure and ecological functioning significantly, but frequently result in reduced biological diversity and productivity. Although lake food-webs can be subsidised to some extent by the adsorption of organic carbon to fine sediments, trophic structure and the composition of biotic assemblages remain likely to be modified considerably. The mineralogy and particle size of sediments and the availability of nutrients, by influencing both the scale and nature of impacts, are key determinants of the overall effects of increased sediment loads on lake ecosystems. Although interactions with other global anthropogenic pressures, such as invasion by exotic species and climate change, are likely to be significant, little remains known about the nature or likely strength of those interactions.

Part one considers energy. It analyses the challenges of meeting future energy demands and the ongoing and future security-related conflicts over energy. Coverage includes security and development concerns related to the oil and gas, nuclear, bio-fuels and hydropower sectors, ensuring energy access for all and addressing sustainable consumption and production in both developed and rapidly industrializing countries such as India, China, Brazil and South Africa. Part two analyses how climate change contributes to global insecurity and presents a consolidated overview of the potential threats and challenges it poses to international peace and development. Coverage includes future water scenarios including a focus on scarcity in the Middle East, food security, biodiversity loss, land degradation, the changing economics of climate change, adaptation and the special case of small island states. The final part lays out the potential avenues and mechanisms available to the international community to address and avert climate and energy instability via the multilateral framework under the United Nations. It also addresses mechanisms for resource and knowledge transfer from industrialized to developing countries to ensure a low-carbon energy transition by focusing on the rapid deployment of clean energy technologies and ways to tackle income and employment insecurity created by the transition away from traditional energy sources.

Some problems are already being addressed in various international instruments, most of which apply beyond national jurisdiction. However, because of the seriousness of the threats to marine ecosystems, States are considering whether existing measures are sufficient. Furthermore, with the recognition of the need to take an integrated, ecosystem approach to ocean management, some States are calling for an implementing agreement to the UN Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC) to address both the conservation and the sustainable use of marine biological resources beyond national jurisdiction. This paper examines the legal background and urges States to elaborate an implementing agreement to the LOSC to create a new regime for marine biodiversity and genetic resources beyond national jurisdiction. © 2009 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","Conservation and sustainable use; Genetic resources beyond national jurisdiction; Marine biodiversity; Marine genetic resources; New regime for marine biodiversity","biodiversity; conservation management; ecosystem health; ecosystem service; food security; genetic resource; habitat fragmentation; human activity; law enforcement; Law of the Sea; marine ecosystem; ocean dumping; sustainability",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-72449208741

Results are presented of a global study of the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) changes over the last 25 years on the fisheries yields of 63 large marine ecosystems (LMEs) that annually produce 80% of the world's marine fisheries catches. Warming trends were observed.in 61 LMEs around the globe. In 18 of the LMEs, rates of SST warming were two to four times faster during the past 25 years than the globally averaged rates of SST warming reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007. Effects of warming on fisheries biomass yields were greatest in the fast-warming northern Northeast Atlantic LMEs, where increasing trends in fisheries biomass yields were related to zooplankton biomass increases. In contrast, fisheries biomass yields of LMEs in the fast-warming, more southerly reaches of the Northeast Atlantic were declining in response to decreases in zooplankton abundance. The LMEs around the margins of the Indian Ocean, where SSTs were among the world's slowest warming, revealed a consistent pattern of fisheries biomass increases during the past 25 years, driven principally by human need for food security from fisheries resources. As a precautionary approach toward more sustainable fisheries utilization, management measures to limit the total allowable catch through a cap-and-sustain approach are suggested for the developing nations recently fishing heavily on resources of the Agulhas Current, Somali Current, Arabian Sea, and Bay of Bengal LMEs. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2009.",,"sea water; biomass; climate change; developing world; fishery; global climate; marine ecosystem; maximum sustainable yield; oceanic current; sea surface temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; zooplankton; animal; article; biomass; comparative study; ecosystem; environmental protection; food industry; greenhouse effect; health; human; international cooperation; sea; statistical model; statistics; temperature; time; Animals; Biomass; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Global Warming; Humans; Internationality; Linear Models; Oceans and Seas; Seawater; Temperature; Time Factors; World Health; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Indian Ocean",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-68749115475

Unlikely it has been thought for long time, soil is a limited resource, easily destroyable but not easily renewable at human life timescale, and therefore should be protected in order to preserve its fundamental functions, both biotic and abiotic. It is worth noting how the soil as a resource is poorly cared for under international conventions, in spite of its importance. The UN Convention on desertification (CCD), f. i., is based on regional development politics rather than sound scientific background, and it is disadvantaged by conceptual problems.The problem of soil conservation is one of the great emergencies in the XXI century. Recent estimates indicate losses of 20 ha/min/year soil, caused by different processes and mechanisms: wind and water erosion, deforestation and land degradation, salinisation, acidification, chemical contamination, etc. Rapid decline in quality and quantity of soil resource, and uncontrolled natural resources consumption, which affects about 33% of the Earth land surface, involving more than 1 billion people, stresses global agriculture with long term negative consequences. In the next twenty years, food security will emerge as a major global issue, forcing developed countries to provide more food, thus provoking imbalances in soil nutrient resources, soil pollution, land degradation, reduction of pedodiversity and biodiversity, increased occurrence of human health problems. New paradigms of soil science, therefore, are needed in order to encompass such dramatic global scenery. Soils are extremely important, f. i., in the global cycle of carbon. Nevertheless, consideration of soils was slow to emerge in the context of the UN Framework Convention of Climate Change (FCCC). Soil scientists could play an increasingly important role in understanding the global carbon cycle and to point out ways to reduce carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere by storing carbon in ecosystems and producing bio-fuel. But the scientific community needs also to increase the visibility of soils in international environmental, social and political context. During the last decades, the focus of societies has changed from agricultural production and forestry towards environmental issues. Soil science is increasingly targeting environmental and cultural issues, such as sustainable land use, ecosystems restoration, remediation strategies for contaminated soils, protection of the food chain and of groundwater resources, protection of human health as well as protection of soil as a cultural and natural heritage. In next years, these issues and other specific aspects, such as soil science for archaeological dating, forensic soil science, and other applications to increasing social and economic demands, will gain importance to achieve the goal of soil and land conservation in a changing world. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Global change; Natural resources; New paradigms; Soil; Sustainable land use",,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934875359

Agricultural production continues to expand into forest lands and marginal crop areas in an attempt to keep pace with the ever-increasing world population. Environmental damage is increasing, including erosion, salinity, desertification, deforestation, threats to biodiversity, and water scarcity. Moreover, climate change/variability is having a profound influence on agroecosystems, posing serious threats to food security, human health, and protection of the environment. Thus, comprehensive agrometeorological adaptation policy guidelines, focusing on preparedness, mitigation, and adaptation measures to support sustainable agricultural development, are needed to cope with the impacts of climate change/variability. Adaptation policy can not be an effective ""stand alone"" strategy, but should be incorporated into a broader policy objective. For example, adaptation to climate change should be a part of a broader socio-economic policy such as agricultural, forest, water resources, natural resources, or coastal-zone management policy. Poorer countries that will require resources to improve capacity in order to cope with impacts, undertake specific adaptation measures.","Adaptation; Climate change; Policy; Preparedness; Sustainable agriculture","adaptive management; agri-environmental policy; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural production; alternative agriculture; biodiversity; climate change; climate variation; deforestation; environmental degradation; food security; global economy; policy analysis; policy strategy; resource scarcity; strategic approach; water supply",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349519374

Despite unprecedented advances in sciences allowing us to visit planets and disclose subatomic particles, serious terrestrial issues about food show clearly that conventional agriculture is no longer suited to feeding humans and preserving ecosystems. Sustainable agriculture is an alternative for solving fundamental and applied issues related to food production in an ecological way (Lal ([CITE]) Agron. Sustain. Dev. 28, 57-64.). While conventional agriculture is driven almost solely by productivity and profit, sustainable agriculture integrates biological, chemical, physical, ecological, economic and social sciences in a comprehensive way to develop new farming practices that are safe and do not degrade our environment.

Here we report (1) the results of the renovation of the journal and (2) a short overview of current concepts of agronomical research for sustainable agriculture.

During the past decade, steady progress has been made in the research of Hg cycling in the Polar Regions. This has generated a unique opportunity to survey the whole Arctic in respect to Hg issue and to find out new discoveries. However, there are still considerable knowledge gaps and debates on the fate of Hg in the Arctic and Antarctica, especially regarding the importance and significance of AMDEs vs. net Hg loadings and other processes that burden Hg in the Arctic. Some studies argued that climate warming since the last century has exerted profound effects on the limnology of High Arctic lakes, including substantial increases in autochthonous primary productivity which increased in sedimentary Hg, whereas some others pointed out the importance of the formation and postdeposition crystallographic history of the snow and ice crystals in determining the fate and concentration of mercury in the cryosphere in addition to AMDEs. Is mercury re-emitted back to the atmosphere after AMDEs? Is Hg methylation effective in the Arctic tundra? Where the sources of MeHg are? What is its fate? Is this stimulated by human made?

This critical review of mercury fates and contamination in the Arctic tundra ecosystem is assessing the impacts and potential risks of Hg contamination on the health of Arctic people and the global northern environment by highlighting and ""perspectiving"" the various mercury processes and concentrations found in the Arctic tundra.

Heat stress and limitations of food and nutrients resources are secondarily correlated. Water inputs are spatiotemporally highly variable and many of the ecosystem functions are pulse driven. Desert regions are found globally in the subtropical high pressure belts, in the rain shadow of mountain ranges or the continental interior, and bordering cold ocean currents. Even though primary productivity by plants and microorganisms is relatively low, species richness and taxonomical diversity can be fairly high. Taxonomically different organisms evolved traits to cope with water stress and often similar life forms arose due to convergent evolution. Typical desert organisms show traits that allow them to avoid periods of extreme aridity in inactive stages and/or to store water for use during drought; a few organisms evolved traits to tolerate the lack of water altogether. Microbial decomposition in deserts is limited due to aridity and the energy flow in desert ecosystems is dominated by detrivores that form the base of the food chain. Humans show adaptations to hot desert climates and a number of cultural practices arose that enable human populations to live near or in deserts. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Multiple cropping is of particular interest because agricultural intensification has increased pressure on water resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity due to increased water withdrawals for irrigation and higher energy inputs due to mechanization and the production of chemical fertilizer. The Poyang Lake region is one of the most intensified agricultural regions in southern China, and the spatial and temporal pattern of cropping systems is determined not only by climate and water availability. Population pressure, social and economic conditions and policies, flood risks, and individual farmers' management decisions also have profound impacts. Therefore, the spatial pattern and temporal process of multiple cropping is quite complex. In this paper, we combined agro-meteorological observation data and MODIS data with a resolution of 500m at 8-day intervals to explore a novel and robust method to examine spatial and temporal dynamics of multiple cropping and crop calendar using a MODIS/EVI time series curve. The results indicate that a cropping intensity algorithm based on this data is potentially applicable for monitoring agricultural intensification. Spatial and temporal variability of multiple cropping may be the result of farmers' dynamic adaptation to local climate, socio-economic conditions, and food security. An explicit spatial and temporal analysis of the complex dynamics of multiple cropping in the context of coupled human and natural systems is necessary' for modeling and evaluating the impacts of human activity on global environmental change and food security.","Land use; Multiple cropping; Poyang Lake; Remote sensing; Spatio-temporal analysis","agrometeorology; algorithm; arable land; farming system; human activity; lake; land management; land use; MODIS; remote sensing; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal distribution; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Jiangxi; Poyang Lake",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-54549123539

A number of climate-related threats to both capture fisheries and aquaculture are identified, but we have low confidence in predictions of future fisheries production because of uncertainty over future global aquatic net primary production and the transfer of this production through the food chain to human consumption. Recent changes in the distribution and productivity of a number of fish species can be ascribed with high confidence to regional climate variability, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Future production may increase in some high-latitude regions because of warming and decreased ice cover, but the dynamics in low-latitude regions are governed by different processes, and production may decline as a result of reduced vertical mixing of the water column and, hence, reduced recycling of nutrients. There are strong interactions between the effects of fishing and the effects of climate because fishing reduces the age, size, and geographic diversity of populations and the biodiversity of marine ecosystems, making both more sensitive to additional stresses such as climate change. Inland fisheries are additionally threatened by changes in precipitation and water management. The frequency and intensity of extreme climate events is likely to have a major impact on future fisheries production in both inland and marine systems.

Even though it is practiced at a local level, it both uses nutrients from the local, national, regional, and global levels and provides nutrients needed to support human populations at all of them. With human populations increasing at 1 to 2 percent per year in many developed nations and in some developing nations at more than 3 percent per year, demands for food are constantly increasing (UNFPA 2002). The productivity per area of arable land must increase in order to match the demand with supply (Helling 1993). Arable land resources are considered a renewable resource as long as good ""stewardship"" is practiced. However, high-quality arable land is a finite resource, and the use of marginal land for agriculture is undesirable since the demand for nutrients exceeds its capacity and, in due time, it degrades and becomes nonrenewable. Fortunately, lands that are marginal for agriculture use are prime lands for other appropriate uses, which provide vital global environmental services (Helling 1993). A good example of providing vital environmental services is the land that is marginal for agriculture in the humid tropical forests. These forests sequester carbon and provide a vital filtration mechanism to the atmosphere as well as hosting the great majority of the earth's biodiversity, an invaluable treasure indispensable to the survival of humanity. In this ecosystem, if the land is deforested and used for agriculture, the fragile soil fertility is lost very quickly due to the extreme climate conditions. In time, this depleted land cannot provide the required nutrient supply, and it no longer provides the original carbon sequestering service to the globe or the habitat necessary for all the species that once lived there (Piel 1992; Panayotou 1993). The ""green revolution"" was a strategy designed to increase the productivity of arable land. It entailed monocultures, which provided higher yields but also optimal conditions for the growth and development of pests. In response, agrochemical applications, especially pesticides and fertilizers, became a generalized management practice. This approach has been used very intensively in the humid tropical regions of Latin America (FAO 1995). This increased use of pesticides was a successful technology because the response or return on investment was good in the short term. However, this practice has degenerated into an uncontrolled and indiscriminate use of these agrochemicals under the philosophy of ""If little is good, more is better."" One of the most relevant reasons for the extensive use of pesticides is the estimated amount of crop losses due to pests such as insects, nematodes, diseases, and weeds. Despite the global application of approximately 3,000,000 MT of pesticides each year, pests destroy more than 40 percent of the world's crop production (Pimentel 1997). It is estimated, however, that pests could destroy as much as 50-60 percent of worldwide crop production if pesticide controls were not utilized (Pimentel 1998). There were very few voices raised alerting the public to the biological and environmental health risk involved in the abusive application of pesticides, first called technical advances and later archetype management practices. For example, there is evidence that some of these chemicals accumulate in plant and animal tissue, and that eventually they may work their way up through the food chain, posing a risk to human health. Studies show that in the world today there are over sixty-five thousand synthetic chemicals in use and that approximately ten thousand are regularly applied. Of these, only about 2 percent have adequate risk assessment information (McCarthy and Shugart 1990). There is also evidence that a considerable amount of applied pesticides is transported out of the application zones by surface runoff and leaching and is deposited in streams and rivers. These watercourses eventually reach the sea, causing effects at a local, national, regional, and global level. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (McKay, Mulvaney, and Thorne- Miller 2000) recognizes eight major causes of environmental change and degradation in oceans. Two of these, chemical pollution and nutrient pollution, can be related directly to agricultural activities. Excessive agrochemical applications leading to chemical pollution can cause poisoning, chronic diseases, reproduction failure, or deformities in marine life. Excessive fertilization, and hence nutrient pollution, increases algae growth, oxygen depletion, water turbidity, and loss of species (McKay, Mulvaney, and Thorne-Miller 2000). The strategies to solve the problem of pesticide movement out of the application zone must be handled at a watershed level. However, the solution-the application of best management practices-must be applied at a farm level. Consequently, the additional costs and investments due to the application of best management practices apply at a local level. Nevertheless, the benefits are enjoyed at a local, national, regional, and global level. In order to provide an incentive for the individual farmer to apply better management practices now, it is necessary to distribute the cost among all the beneficiaries. The question is how to measure this benefit at each level, and how to allocate the costs proportionately to each level. Policies need to be set at all levels, and this entails multilateral negotiations. This chapter explores possible joint solutions to the problem of pesticide movement out of the application zone, and subsequent natural water resources contamination, in a specific subregion of the Caribbean Sea, the Mesoamerican Caribbean Basin (MCB). © 2007 by the University of New Mexico Press.

Trade liberalization affects many of these farmers differently- often negatively when subsidies and protections are removed, sometimes under the direction of ""structural adjustment"" programs of, for example, the IMF or the World Bank; in some cases positively when previous policies were biased against agriculture and when a freer access to market expands opportunities. Looking beyond short-term profits, the question of whether the new policies induce more sustainable production systems is still quite ambiguous. Small farmers are also struggling to adopt new technologies. There seemingly is a large variety of technologies available, but adoption is still low among small farmers from tropical countries. What type of policies and what type of technologies can help improve productivity of poor farmers while maintaining the resource base? To what degree do these new technologies make small farmers beholden to debt, the industrialized countries, and the probable future increases in the price of petroleum and its products? To answer these questions, one has to study farming systems in some detail and make some predictions about how these systems will respond, change, and adapt to external incentives while population is increasing rapidly even as natural resources are under increasing pressure. Teams of economists and agriculturalists join their expertise to link farming system analysis and natural resources processes with human behavioral models to simulate the dynamics of the farming systems under various scenarios. In this chapter we present a few applications of these bioeconomic models to address the impacts of increasing population pressure, increasing access to markets, and external incentives related to welfare and natural resources management. What are the relations between these factors and environmental degradation? What are the policy and technical options to make these systems more sustainable? In the first part of the chapter, we present the tropical agroecosystems that we studied. In the second, we review the use of bioeconomic models in agriculture. In the third we describe a few applications, and in the last part we present overall results and conclusions. The Tropical Agroecosystems Studied Tropical small-scale farming systems are numerous and diverse but can be categorized according to a gradient of management intensity from slash-andburn to permanent agriculture (Ruthenberg 1980). In this chapter we analyze and compare the fallow systems from the savanna of West Africa, the forest systems of the hillsides of Central America, the rancher system of the humid forest margin of Amazonia in Brazil, and the permanent intensive systems of the subhumid Gangetic Plain of northern India as representative of this gradient of intensification. In West Africa, increasing population pressure on land should lead, at least according to the Boserup school of thought, to labor and capital intensification and to the adoption of new technologies (Boserup 1965; see chapter 12). Instead, we observe migrations either to less-populated rural areas or to overcrowded cities. Trade liberalization of the mid-1990s was supposed to free farmers from an ""inefficient"" state, but while the devaluation of an overvalued currency had a positive impact, privatization led to market failures and too often the destruction of these farmers' way of subsistence. The three African villages studied, located on a north-south transect representing a gradient of increasing rainfall, are typical of their climatic conditions. The Sahelian village of Banizoumbou in Niger (ILRI dataset 1998) was used to predict the future of transhumance in the Sahel (Barbier and Hazell 2000). Increasing population pressure and expansion of cropland makes the traditional transhumance migrations of cattle and sheep from north to south more difficult every year. While most ""experts"" believe that nomadism has no future, a recent school of thought argues that it is the most suitable human activity for the Sahelian ecosystem (Scoones 1996). The other semiarid village, Kolbila on the Mossi Plateau of Burkina Faso (ICRISAT dataset), is less arid but is located in a much more densely populated region. Agriculture is the main activity, but its sustainability is at risk because of declining biomass and soil fertility. The village of Bala, located in the cotton-producing area of Burkina Faso (CIRAD dataset), is in a more humid region. It is less populated at present, but immigration from the north is increasing population pressure, which induces a shift from slash-andburn to a more intensive but not yet sustainable system (Barbier and BenoÎt-Cattin 1997). In Central America, we analyzed the situation of the communities on the hillsides of Honduras. In addition to being the second-poorest country of the American continent after Haiti, Honduras was hit by a hurricane in 1999, which destroyed a large part of its infrastructure and showed as well how poor management of its upper watersheds has made its valleys vulnerable to floods and landslides. Most of the fertile lowland valleys are used for extensive large-scale ranching, while small farmers struggle on the steep hillsides where the topsoil is eroding rapidly. The five Honduran watersheds where we applied bioeconomic models represent contrasting pathways of development. Farmers in the Lalima watershed follow a vegetable production pathway, producing principally a large range of vegetables. Overdrafting of the river by irrigation reduces water availability during the dry season (Barbier and Bergeron 1999). The San Nicolas watershed has become an intensive coffee production and processing area, which generates extremely high levels of water contamination that in turn affect many downstream communities (Barbier et al. 2003). The Río Calán watershed produces vegetables and coffee and supplies water to the downstream city of Siguatapeque and to a large hydroelectric dam (Jimenez et al. 2000). In the Jalapa watershed, farmers produce on steep slopes prone to rapid erosion and are part of the El Cajón watershed, which drains into a dam that generates 60 percent of the electricity used in Honduras (Hernández 2002:642). In the Choluteca watershed, widespread grain production on slopes threatens the sustainability of the shrimp industry downstream in the mangroves of the Golfo de Fonseca (Hernández et al. 2002). The large charge of sediment in the water makes shrimp production much more expensive (Samayoa 2000:647). In these watersheds, the ""pathway of development"" type applied by the population has been explained as principally a function of exogenous factors such as agroclimatic conditions, availability of spring water, and access to markets (Pender et al. 1999). The two watersheds that were well connected to markets have progressively expanded their vegetable production. Those located farther from a good paved road or major city have focused on coffee where rainfall is generous and on basic grain if the climate is drier. In Brazil, the Amazonian forest continues to shrink progressively under pressure from loggers followed by small farmers and finally ranchers. In some areas the Brazilian government is trying to prevent farmers from clearing more forest by allocating plots of a few dozen hectares of forest margin to families, under the condition that they will stay within these boundaries and clear only half of their holdings. One such settlement project takes place on the western southern border of the Amazonian forest (IFPRI dataset) in the regionsof Rondonia. The objective of the study was to identify the second-best alternative to slash-andburn (Carpentier et al. 1999). Is it coffee, timber production, forest products extraction, food crop, cattle ranching, or carbon sequestration? The model was supposed to verify if the new systems are economical and environmentally sustainable. The Indian study is set in Haryana state in northern India, one of the most productive states of India, and also one of the most populated. In the 1960s and 1970s the green revolution, based on improved germ plasm, chemical fertilizers, and irrigation, transformed the state into a massive producer of rice and wheat. The adoption of new techniques was helped by heavy governmental subsidies to reduce input price and stabilize output prices especially for wheat and rice (Aggarwal et al. 2000; Dorin and Landy 2002). Now that the Indian government is trying to cut subsidies to the agricultural sector, some fear that Haryana's grain production will stagnate. Now that the government wants to reduce subsidies for water and electricity, one has to assess the likely impact on production, poverty, and the environment (Alary 2002:645). Overall, the comparative study given in this chapter includes nine farming systems in four ecoregions of five countries (tables 31.1-31.3). All except the Indian example are small-scale, semicommercialized farming systems integrating crop and livestock, using mainly hand tools with little mechanization and irrigation. They are all increasingly integrated to the market, but population pressures and resource degradation are at play. © 2007 by the University of New Mexico Press.

Lakes, rivers, and wetlands on the arctic landscape are normally not connected with groundwater in the same way that they are in temperate regions. When the surface is frozen in winter, only lakes deeper than 2m and rivers with significant flow retain liquid water. Surface water is largely abundant in summer, when it serves as a breeding ground for fish, birds, and mammals. In winter, many mammals and birds are forced to migrate out of the Arctic. Fish must seek out lakes or rivers deep enough to provide good overwintering habitat. Humans in the Arctic rely on surface water in many ways. Surface water meets domestic needs such as drinking, cooking, and cleaning as well as subsistence and industrial demands. Indigenous communities depend on sea ice and waterways for transportation across the landscape and access to traditional country foods. The minerals, mining, and oil and gas industries also use large quantities of surface water during winter to build ice roads and maintain infrastructure. As demand for this limited, but heavily-relied-upon resource continues to increase, it is now more critical than ever to understand the impacts of climate change on food and water security in the Arctic. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","Arctic; Climate change; Lakes; Subsistence; Surface water","Birds; Climate change; Fish; Groundwater; Lakes; Mammals; Oils and fats; Rivers; Sea ice; Surface waters; Waterway transportation; Arctic; Breeding grounds; Ground surfaces; Indigenous community; Industrial demands; Oil and Gas Industry; Subsistence; Temperate regions; Thermal processing (foods)",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-37649021048

One of the projects funded by the EC under the 5th Framework Programme is also the MEDCOASTLAND Thematic Network whose main goal is Mediterranean coordination and dissemination of land conservation management to combat land degradation for the sustainable use of natural resources in the region with special emphases on coastal areas. The network brings together 13 countries (from northern Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, Middle and Near East) making a total of 32 partners, of whom 17 are research and educational institutions, 7 represent decision makers and the remaining 8 are farmer’s associations and/or non governmental organisations (NGOs). The International Centre for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies (CIHEAM) through the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Bari (MAI-B), in Italy is coordinating the project that runs from October 2002 until May 2007. MEDCOASTLAND endorses the ecosystem-based approach in natural resource management by giving equal importance to both biophysical and socio-economic features. Conclusions show that the fight against land degradation could be successful if land users meet their basic needs through income generating activities and if a good balance is found between bottom-up and top-down decision making and last but not least, if policy, legislation, and the institutional framework make their way towards implementation.

Such large-scale changes in global land use and land cover can have significant consequences for food production, freshwater supply, forest resources, biodiversity, regional and global climates, the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc. In particular, land management and changes in land use can affect fluxes of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. Recently, Hannah et al. (1994) estimated that roughly 50% of the planet’s land surface (75% of the habitable area) has been either moderately or severely disturbed; only the core of the tropical rainforests and boreal forests, deserts, and ice-covered surfaces are still relatively untouched by humans. Moreover, Vitousek et al. (1997) estimated that around 40% of the global net primary productivity is being co-opted by humans, while Postel et al. (1996) estimated that over 50% of the available renewable freshwater supply is being co-opted. The major mode of human land transformation has been through agriculture. Since the invention of agriculture, ~10 000 years ago, humans have modified or transformed the land surface; today, roughly a third of the planet’s land surface is being used for growing crops or grazing animals (National Geographic Maps, 2002; Foley et al., 2003). © Cambridge University Press 2007, Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,"Agriculture; Arid regions; Biodiversity; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Ecosystems; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Natural resources; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Surface measurement; Water; Agricultural land use; Freshwater supply; Ice-covered surface; Integrated assessment models; Land transformation; Land use and land cover; Net primary productivity; Tropical rain forest; Aluminum alloys",Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-45449105728

This is unfortunate since, contrary to popular belief, they support diverse ecological assemblages whose species are mostly small and buried and which deserve protection as part of ecologically sustainable development (ESD). Moreover, the management of beaches and linked adjacent ecosystems is becoming increasingly important because of their vulnerability to burgeoning human pressures including climate change. Although there are large uncertainties involved, some of the climate-related environmental changes and their ecological consequences for sandy beaches are explored in this paper, some management issues discussed and research proposed. Temperature-related changes include the likelihood that the geographical ranges of some species will change, some cool-adapted species will decline in abundance, possibly to extinction, and the rate of processes such as decomposition and photosynthesis will increase. The increasing acidification of the ocean may affect many beach species directly via reduced calcification and indirectly via changes to the phytoplankton on which some beach species depend for food. Changed hydrology may affect both nearshore primary productivity and the larval movements of many species. Increased storminess may change the morphodynamic state of beaches with consequent effects on the diversity, abundance and composition of beach assemblages. The combination of storm surges and sea-level rise may enhance erosion rates, the most extreme effect being the total loss of sandy beach habitat, especially if sea-walls are deployed to protect coastal assets. Alternatively, in some areas there may be a slow retreat of the coastline with few effects on beach ecosystems. Concerning management, both mitigation and adaptation strategies are needed to meet public ESD goals. The former would seek to constrain the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases by addressing the underlying causes (i.e., population and economic growth) and by applying appropriate technologies. Adaptation strategies would recognise the linkages between beaches, dunes and surf zones and maintain sand movement and storage and allow for the landward migration of beaches. Failing this, the active maintenance of beaches in their present location by soft engineering (e.g., the transport of sand to the intertidal beach from elsewhere, a process called beach nourishment) is far preferable to hard engineering (e.g., sea-walls) from the nature conservation and socio-economic points of view. Since beach ecosystems are poorly understood even at basic descriptive levels, future management, monitoring, and predictions of the possible impacts of large-scale phenomena (such as global climate change) will be assisted by basic research into documenting biodiversity, community dynamics, autecology, and eco-physiology of beach fauna and the linkages with adjacent ecosystems. As well, the use of human interventions (e.g., beach nourishment) as scientific experiments combined with optimised monitoring is recommended.","Climate change; Ecology; Management; Sandy beaches","abundance; anthropogenic effect; beach; beach nourishment; biodiversity; climate change; coastal zone management; community composition; ecosystem management; phytoplankton; sustainable development; vulnerability; Australasia; Australia",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-40349091871

Cluster analysis (Q-mode and R-mode) based on the most abundant taxa was used to recognize similarities within the data set. Three main clusters were established by Q-mode cluster analysis. The species distribution pattern of two of these three clusters is clearly related with changes in texture of the sediments. Textural data and benthic foraminifera proxies suggest that between ∼4.8 and 2.2 ka cal BP there was a period of higher hydrodynamism, with more energetic oceanic currents associated with shelf mixed waters. The period since ∼2.2 ka cal BP until present was characterized by generally lower bottom energetic conditions and by a supply of finer sediment, which was richer in organic matter leading to more eutrophic conditions in the benthic environment, mainly between ∼2.2 and 1.2 ka cal BP and since ∼0.5 ka cal BP until the present. Eutrophication was probably determined by strong water column stratified conditions and by coastal upwelling-dominated depositional intervals and/or by higher lateral flux of organic carbon. Since the upwelling increasing periods are in general due the intensification of northerly winds, both most productive upwelling-dominated periods may be attributed to climatic/oceanographic induced changes during the Sub-Atlantic climate. Small sea levels oscillations also should contribute to these results. Eutrophication since the end of Little Ice Age may be related to human influence in coastal areas.","Holocene; NW Iberian upwelling system; Productivity benthic foraminifera proxies; Stratification","Holocene; paleoceanography; upwelling; Eurasia; Europe; Iberian Peninsula; Southern Europe; Foraminifera",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644767938

The use of crop residues for fuel and non-use of animal dung for manure have exacerbated the problem of soil and environmental degradation. The attendant decline in soil quality, reduction in agronomic productivity and environment moderation capacity are biophysical processes driven by socio-economic and political forces. The problem is widespread in developing countries where extractive farming practices of mining soil fertility are widely used by resource-poor farmers. Biomass productivity of these degraded soils/wasteland is too low and uneconomic. With rapid increase in population in Asia and Africa, the per capita arable land area is decreasing and is already 0.1 ha in several densely populated countries, and arable land cannot be converted to biofuel plantations. Establishing biofuel plantations (e.g., Jatropha, Pongamia) on degraded soils can be a win-win strategy provided that these soils are adequately restored and specific problems (e.g., nutrient and water imbalance, loss of topsoil, shallow rooting depth, drought stress, salinization, compaction, crusting) are alleviated. Another strategy is to adopt practices of land-saving technologies, such as agricultural intensification on prime agricultural lands to improve crop yields, so that surplus land can be converted to biofuel plantations. Production of biofuels can reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and advance food security, while achieving energy security, improving environment quality and sequestering carbon in biota and soil. The global potential for soil carbon sequestration is 0.7 to 1.5 Pg C/yr, which can offset 20 to 40 % of the annual increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2. Trading carbon credits under the CDM or World Bank funds can provide another source of income for resource-poor farmers. The sustainability of a biofuel production system must be assessed through evaluation of the ecosystem carbon budget, accounting for carbon-based inputs in all on-farm operations and industrial processes. © 2006 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,"Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Air quality; Animals; Biofuels; Budget control; Crops; Developing countries; Economics; Energy security; Fertilizers; Food supply; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Productivity; Soils; Sustainable development; Water quality; Agricultural intensification; Atmospheric concentration; Biomass productivity; Biophysical process; Environment quality; Industrial processs; Sequestering carbon; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil pollution; Animalia; Jatropha; Pongamia",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645511975

Their productive nature is linked to the fact that they process much of the world's riverine and coastal watershed discharge. These watersheds support more than 75% of the human population and are sites of large increases in nutrient loading associated with urban and agricultural expansion. Increased nutrient loading has led to accelerated primary production, or eutrophication; symptoms include increased algal bloom activity (including harmful taxa), accumulation of organic matter, and excessive oxygen consumption (hypoxia and anoxia). While nutrient-enhanced eutrophication is a ""driver"" of hypoxia and anoxia, physical-chemical alterations due to climatic events, such as stormwater discharge, flooding, droughts, stagnancy, and elevated temperatures are also involved. The complex interactions of anthropogenic and climatic factors determine the magnitude, duration, and aerial extent of productivity, algal booms, hypoxia, and anoxia. Using the eutrophic Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, USA, as a case study, the physical-chemical mechanisms controlling algal bloom and hypoxia dynamics were examined. Because primary production in the NRE and many other estuaries is largely nitrogen (N) limited, emphasis has been placed on reducing N inputs. Both the amounts and chemical forms of N play roles in determining the composition and extent of phytoplankton blooms that supply the bulk of the organic carbon fueling hypoxia. Biomass from bloom organisms that are readily grazed will be readily transferred up the planktonic and benthic food chain, while toxic or inedible blooms frequently promote sedimentary C flux, microbial mineralization, and hence may exacerbate hypoxia potential. From a watershed perspective, nutrient input reductions are the main options for reducing eutrophication. Being able to distinguish the individual and cumulative effects of physical, chemical and biotic controls of phytoplankton productivity and composition is key to understanding, predicting, and ultimately managing eutrophication. Long-term collaborative (University, State, Federal) monitoring, experimental assessments, and modeling of eutrophication dynamics over appropriate spatial and temporal scales is essential for developing realistic, ecologically sound, and cost-effective nutrient management strategies for estuarine and coastal ecosystems impacted by both anthropogenic and climatic perturbations. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

It is therefore often difficult to understand the relationships between the different diatom taxa and the environmental parameters. Classically, multivariate analyses, such as principal component analysis, are used to project the abundance of diatom data on a two dimensional graph. The first two axes are in general used, but they represent only a part of the explained variability. Cluster analysis based on Bray-Curtis distances (Bray and Curtis 1957) or Twinspan ordinations (Hill 1979b) are also very often used techniques to sort samples of diatom assemblages into groups of homogeneous composition. The Self Organizing Maps (SOM; Kohonen 1982) are able to cluster the sites and to summarise a database on a two dimensional graph. The projection is made in a non-linear way with an artificial neural network onto a map composed of hexagons (Fig. 5.7.1), the Kohonen map. In contrast to multivariate analysis, the Kohonen map represents all the explained variability of the dataset. The projection is made thanks to an artificial neural network composed of two layers: the first one (input layer) is connected to the samples, the second one (output layer) to the hexagons of the map. The projection is made respecting the similarities between the samples. Samples with homogeneous assemblages are placed in a same hexagon or in neighbouring hexagons and samples with very different assemblages are placed in distant hexagons. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), are models that function somewhat like a human brain as they have a learning ability. They establish links between information and solutions. Only a few studies have already used this kind of techniques and have demonstrated their clustering properties for biological communities (Chon et al. 1996, Foody 1999, Giraudel and Lek 2001). Artificial Neural Networks using backpropagation algorithms (ANN-BP) are models that can be used for predicting one or several variables using other, predictive, variables. This kind of model is composed of processing elements called ""neurons"" which are arranged in three layers (Fig. 5.7.2). The first layer, the ""input layer"", is corresponding to the input variables, as, for instance, environmental parameters. The last layer, the ""output layer"", is composed of neurons providing a prediction for the expected variables. The layer between both, the ""hidden layer"", is composed of neurons composed of a non-linear function. These neurons receive information from the input neurons, transform it with the nonlinear function (log sigmoid for instance), and send this new information to the output neurons. Connections between neurons are weighted in order to modulate the importance of the information fluxes. Output neurons collect the information and give a prediction. The network is trained with a part of the database. Predictions are given and compared with the reality. The aim of the training is to find the best weights for the connections in order to get a minimal error between predictions and observations. The other part of the database, which is not used for the learning phase, is used to test the network with fixed weights (validation procedure). Several studies have already shown the ability of ANN-BP to predict the structure of macro-invertebrate or fish communities in rivers (Brosse and Lek 2000a, Chon et al. 2000c among others), density (Chon et al. 2000c) or species richness (Park et al. 2003a) of macroinvertebrate in rivers, Pacific sardine biomass (Cisneros-Mata et al. 2000) or fish species abundance in the Seine basin in France using stream order, slope, width, water quality, habitat quality and the ecoregion as input parameters (Boët and Fuhs 2000). Several studies showed that ANN-BP gives better results than other techniques such as multiple regressions (Lek et al. 1995, Brosse and Lek 2000b, Scardi 2000). This can be partly explained by the ability of artificial neural networks ""to take into account the non-linear relationships between dependent variables and each independent variable"" (Lek et al. 1995). Few applications exist for algal communities, besides prediction of blue-green algae blooms in rivers (Recknagel 1997) or in lakes (French and Recknagel 1994). Scardi (2000) used ANN to predict phytoplankton productivity in the Gulf of Napoli from temperature, irradiance, geographical coordinates and the day of the year as predictive variables. The structure of benthic diatom assemblages is potentially determined by many environmental factors acting at different spatial scales (Stevenson 1997, Snyder et al. 2002). Several studies established correlations between diatoms and physico-chemical variables (Stoermer and Smol 1999), and, among other applications, these observations led to the development of biotic indices to assess the water quality. These biotic indices are generally calculated with species sensitivity to pollution, their indicator value and their relative abundance. They are now routinely used in Europe (Prygiel et al. 1999) and some of them are standardized (Kelly et al. 1998, AFNOR 2000). Recently, the European Parliament (2000) required to develop new assessment tools for inland waters, which must comply to the Water Framework Directive (WFD). This directive aims to restore surface and underground waters to a good ecological status, which implies to define typologies and reference conditions for several water bodies. The WFD specifies that the ecoregional setting has to be taken into account. Ecoregions (Omernik 1987, 1995, Wasson in Cemagref 2001) classify landscapes on the basis of climates, geology, soil topography and potential vegetation. River typology can be defined for instance on the basis of distance to the source, river width, slope and maximal annual temperature (Verneaux and Leynaud 1974). The reference conditions should be defined in each river type in each ecoregion, and this can be done using modelling techniques. The first aim of this study was to explore benthic diatom assemblages in headwater streams of Luxembourg in order to propose type assemblages for unpolluted rivers of this typological level. The interest to work on a spatially reduced region and on homogeneous typological levels lies in the homogeneity of diatom and environmental data and in the precision of the classification developed. A priori, such an approach should provide more detail than studies carried out at a wider scale using data coming from very different regions and river types. Different assemblages were defined using SOM (Kohonen 1982) and could be related to distinct regions of Luxembourg. The second objective was to test whether diatom assemblages of the headwater streams of Luxembourg can be accurately predicted by using environmental parameters, in order to assess the use predictive models for defining the reference conditions as required by the WFD. ANN-BP was used to predict the groups of samples formerly defined by SOM. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-34147112614

Indigenous people generally settled at the water's edge so that aquatic foods made up part of their diversified diet, with the rest of the diversity dependent on how much they hunted and gathered, on herded animals, engagement in subsistence agriculture, the ability to process and preserve food and/or food commodities traded. The rapid urbanization of much of the world's population distances people from the origin of their food, the understanding of the required commodities in the human diet (e.g., aquatic food, plant foods, lean animal foods, what animals are fed, basics of freshness). At the same time, adequacy of food intake may be more reliably achieved when the food supply can continue irrespective of season, climate or distant conflict. Urban gardens partly rectify this discord between urbanization and a genuinely varied diet, replaced by purported variety where the same basic commodity is presented in many different forms (e.g., wheat grains such as bread, breakfast cereal of various kinds, pasta and baked goods). However, diversified processing may 'dilute out' health adverse techniques. The health benefits of a diversified diet relate in part to the environmental integrity, which the required biodiversity provides, in part to minimizing adverse factors, which may exceed acceptable thresholds in a narrow diet, and to the need for the wide spectrum of food components, macronutrients, micronutrients and phytochemicals, which Homosapiens' physiology requires. Whilst most food diversity is attributable to plant sources, animal sources often provide significant nutritional security (e.g., fish and eggs for vitamin D, fish for n-3 fatty acids, lean meat for iron and zinc and in readily assimilable forms). Food diversity assumes greater importance with aging populations as their physical activity usually (if not necessarily) declines and the required food component diversity of the diet increases correspondingly. There are ways in which the required food diversity (probably 20-30 biologically different distinct foods over the course of a week) can be reduced. This is by the inclusion of more food component dense foods - like fish, lean meat, eggs, seeds and nuts. Not only does food diversity have relevance in a public health and food policy sense, but also in individual counseling in clinical practice. Assessment of a patient's food variety can be rapid and semi-quantitative, encouraging small and consequential changes in diet. When ethnicity is taken into account, in the clinical setting, this process can be even more rewarding for the practitioner and patient. Copyright © 2005 S.

General circulation models for assessing future climate, coupled to direct measurements, predict that atmospheric CO2 levels will continue to increase (Schneider et al., 1992; Vitousek, 1994). More locally, significant regional climate changes in the primary agricultural regions of North America are anticipated (Rind et al., 1990; Schneider et al., 1992; Schneider, 1993; Reddy and Hodges, 2000), including increased summer temperatures (4°C to 8°C), decreased precipitation, and a significant drop in available soil water (ca. 40% to 50%), each associated with a significant change in seasonality. Some analyses indicate that both environmental changes and system responses can be sudden rather than gradual, further exacerbating the impact (Rietkerk and van de Koppel, 1997; van de Koppel et al., 1998; Alley et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2003). Human activity has greatly affected atmospheric concentrations of patterns of deposition of gaseous pollutants (e.g., SOx, NOx) that could affect insects in agro-ecosystems (Brown, 1995). In this context, important questions remain about responses of important natural and agricultural systems, including the issue of how agricultural pests and resulting food security will be affected. Diverse arthropod pests and plant pathogens significantly reduce agricultural production at present (Pimentel, 1991). How pests and their interactions with other organisms and the environment will respond to these changes, and whether such changes can be predicted is a big concern - one that requires consideration of regional and local climate changes that transcend global averages (Cammell and Knight, 1992; Lansberg and Smith, 1992; Harrington and Stork, 1995; Walther et al., 2002). The problem is complex and there are many possible ways that climate change from increased CO2 can affect the outbreak potential of insect herbivores in agricultural systems. In general, if CO2 continues to rise, average temperatures will also increase and precipitation will become more variable, suggesting that effects from temperature-dependent processes and plant responses to environmental stresses are the keys for understanding insect pests. One must also be cognizant of altered land use in the face of climate change as farmers and ranchers are likely to adapt and plant the most appropriate crops for new environmental and economic conditions. © 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745451998

Recent estimates of water stocks and flows through the world's hydrologic cycle and their spatiotemporal variability illustrate the nature of current and projected water disparities throughout the world. As all such problems manifest themselves at smaller scales, a major challenge in freshwater assessments is how to handle this on different geographical scales. Increasing use of water is creating water shortages in many countries that are projected to have significant population increases in the next 25 years. Humankind is projected to appropriate from 70% to 90% of all accessible freshwater by 2025. Agriculture is the dominant component of human water use, accounting for almost 70% of all water withdrawals. Hence, many of the solutions to water-related food and environmental security come from within agriculture by increasing the efficiency and productivity of water use. Many factors significantly impact the increasing water demand, including population growth, economic growth, technological development, land use and urbanization, rate of environmental degradation, government programs, climate change, and others. Demand management, not increasing supply availability, is the realistic way forward. Although, thanks to market forces, the threatened exhaustion of nonrenewable resources has not happened, renewable resources, such as freshwater, remain problematic because they are vulnerable to human overuse and pollution. Climate change adds further risks and uncertainties to the global picture requiring the adoption of adaptive management in water resources based on monitoring and reevaluation. Although climate change may be perceived as a long-term problem, it needs to be addressed now because decisions today will affect society's ability to adapt to increasing variability in tomorrow's climate. If we are to balance freshwater supply with demand, and also protect the integrity of aquatic ecosystems, a fundamental change in current wasteful patterns of production and consumption is needed.

Now, this national priority is facing new challenges from the possible impacts of climate change in addition to the already existing threats from rapid population growth, declining availability of cultivable land, and inadequate access to water in the dry season. In this backdrop, this paper has examined the nature and magnitude of these threats for the benchmark years of 2030 and 2050. It has been shown that the overall impact of climate change on the production of food grains in Bangladesh would probably be small in 2030. This is due to the strong positive impact of CO2 fertilization that would compensate for the negative impacts of higher temperature and sea level rise. In 2050, the negative impacts of climate change might become noticeable: production of rice and wheat might drop by 8% and 32%, respectively. However, rice would be less affected by climate change compared to wheat, which is more sensitive to a change in temperature. Based on the population projections and analysis of future agronomic innovations, this study further shows that the availability of cultivable land alone would not be a constraint for achieving food self-sufficiency, provided that the productivity of rice and wheat grows at a rate of 10% or more per decade. However, the situation would be more critical in terms of water availability. If the dry season water availability does not decline from the 1990 level of about 100 Bm3, there would be just enough water in 2030 for meeting both the agricultural and nonagricultural needs. In 2050, the demand for irrigation water to maintain food self-sufficiency would be about 40% to 50% of the dry season water availability. Meeting such a high agricultural water demand might cause significant negative impacts on the domestic and commercial water supply, fisheries, ecosystems, navigation, and salinity management. © 2004 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Climate change; Crop productivity; Cultivable land; Food security; Irrigation; Population projection","Agriculture; Constraint theory; Crops; Ecosystems; Irrigation; Population statistics; Resource allocation; Sea level; Water supply; Food grains; Food security; Population growth; Resource constraints; Climate change; carbon dioxide; water; climate change; cultivation; food security; nature-society relations; population growth; agricultural management; article; climate change; ecosystem; fertilization; fishery management; food availability; food industry; food storage; high temperature; population growth; resource allocation; resource management; rice; salinity; sea level; temperature dependence; water availability; water supply; wheat; Agriculture; Bangladesh; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Food Supply; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Oryza sativa; Population Growth; Temperature; Triticum; Water Supply; Agriculture; Ecosystems; Farm Crops; Irrigation; Meteorology; Resource Management; Water Supply; Asia; Bangladesh; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; South Asia; World; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-13444276206

Particular focus is given to the savannah zone, covering 40% of the land area in the world, where water scarcity constitutes a serious constraint to sustainable development. The analysis indicates an urgent need for a new green revolution, which focuses on upgrading rain-fed agriculture. Water requirements to produce adequate diets for humans are shown to be relatively generic irrespective of hydro-climate, amounting to a global average of 1300 m3 cap-1 yr-1. Present food production requires an estimated 6800 km3 yr-1 of consumptive green water (5000 km3 yr-1 in rain-fed agriculture and 1800 km3 yr-1 from irrigated crops). Without considering water productivity gains, an additional 5800 km3 yr-1 of water is needed to feed a growing population in 2050 and eradicate malnutrition. It is shown that the bulk of this water will be used in rain-fed agriculture. A dynamic analysis of water productivity and management options indicates that large 'crop per drop' improvements can be achieved at the farm level. Vapour shift in favour of productive green water flow as crop transpiration could result in relative water savings of 500 km3 yr-1 in semi-arid rain-fed agriculture.","Evapotranspiration; Food; Rain-fed agriculture; Savannah; Water productivity","drought; evapotranspiration; food; rainfed agriculture; tropical region; water management",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346020479

The deep-sea floor ecosystem is one of the largest on the planet, covering roughly 60% of the Earth's solid surface. Despite this vast size, our knowledge of the deep sea is poor relative to other marine ecosystems, and future human threats are difficult to predict. Low productivity, low physical energy, low biological rates, and the vastness of the soft-sediment deep sea create an unusual suite of conservation challenges relative to shallow water. The numerous, but widely spaced, island habitats of the deep ocean (for example seamounts, hydrothermal vents and submarine canyons) differ from typical deep-sea soft sediments in substrate type (hard) and levels of productivity (often high); these habitats will respond differently to anthropogenic impacts and climate change. The principal human threats to the deep sea are the disposal of wastes (structures, radioactive wastes, munitions and carbon dioxide), deep-sea fishing, oil and gas extraction, marine mineral extraction, and climate change. Current international regulations prohibit deep-sea dumping of structures, radioactive waste and munitions. Future disposal activities that could be significant by 2025 include deep-sea carbon-dioxide sequestration, sewage-sludge emplacement and dredge-spoil disposal. As fish stocks dwindle in the upper ocean, deep-sea fisheries are increasingly targeted. Most (perhaps all) of these deep-sea fisheries are not sustainable in the long term given current management practices; deep-sea fish are long-lived, slow growing and very slow to recruit in the face of sustained fishing pressure. Oil and gas exploitation has begun, and will continue, in deep water, creating significant localized impacts resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings. Marine mineral extraction, in particular manganese nodule mining, represents one of the most significant conservation challenges in the deep sea. The vast spatial scales planned for nodule mining dwarf other potential direct human impacts. Nodule-mining disturbance will likely affect tens to hundreds of thousands of square kilometres with ecosystem recovery requiring many decades to millions of years (for nodule regrowth). Limited knowledge of the taxonomy, species structure, biogeography and basic natural history of deep-sea animals prevents accurate assessment of the risk of species extinctions from large-scale mining. While there are close linkages between benthic, pelagic and climatic processes, it is difficult to predict the impact of climate change on deep-sea benthic ecosystems; it is certain, however, that changes in primary production in surface waters will alter the standing stocks in the food-limited, deep-sea benthic. Long time-series studies from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that even seemingly stable deep-sea ecosystems may exhibit change in key ecological parameters on decadal time scales. The causes of these decadal changes remain enigmatic. Compared to the rest of the planet, the bulk of the deep sea will probably remain relatively unimpacted by human activities and climate change in the year 2025. However, increased pressure on terrestrial resources will certainly lead to an expansion of direct human activities in the deep sea, and to direct and indirect environmental impacts. Because so little is known about this remote environment, the deep-sea ecosystem may well be substantially modified before its natural state is fully understood.","Anthropogenic change; Climate change; Deep-sea ecosystem; Deep-sea fisheries; Deep-sea mining; Drill cuttings; Environmental impacts; Future status; Long-term trends; Manganese nodules; Oil and gas drilling; Sea floor; Waste disposal","Conservation; Ecosystems; Sediments; Deep-sea floor ecosystems; Environmental engineering; deep sea; environmental change; future prospect; marine ecosystem; nature-society relations; anthropology; benthos; climate change; daily life activity; deep sea; dumping; ecosystem; environmental protection; extraction; fishing; habitat structure; marine environment; mining; productivity; review; sea pollution; sediment; sewage treatment; sludge treatment; species extinction; taxonomy; terrestrial surface waters; waste disposal; water contamination; Animalia",Review,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0141533287

Soil health, or quality, can be broadly defined as the capacity of a living soil to function, within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and animal health. Soil quality and health change over time due to natural events or human impacts. They are enhanced by management and land-use decisions that weigh the multiple functions of soil and are impaired by decisions which focus only on single functions, such as crop productivity. Criteria for indicators of soil quality and health relate mainly to their utility in defining ecosystem processes and in integrating physical, chemical, and biological properties; their sensitivity to management and climatic variations; and their accessibility and utility to agricultural specialists, producers, conservationists, and policy makers. Although soils have an inherent quality as related to their physical, chemical, and biological properties within the constraints set by climate and ecosystems, the ultimate determinant of soil quality and health is the land manager. As such, the assessment of soil quality or health, and direction of change with time, is the primary indicator of sustainable management. Scientists can make a significant contribution to sustainable land management by translating scientific knowledge and information on soil function into practical tools and approaches by which land managers can assess the sustainability of their management practices. The first steps, however, in our communal journey towards sustainable land management must be the identification of our final destination (sustainability goals), the strategies or course by which we will get there, and the indicators (benchmarks) that we are proceeding in the right direction. We too often rush to raise the sails of our 'technological' ship to catch the wind, before knowing from where it comes or in properly defining our destination, charting our course, and setting the rudder of our ship. Examples are given of approaches for assessing soil quality and health to define the sustainability of land management practices and to 'translate our science into practice'. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Long-term changes in the world's climate may affect many requisites of good health - sufficient food, safe and adequate drinking water and secure dwelling. The current large-scale social and environmental changes mean that we must assign a much higher priority to population health in the policy debate on climate change. Climate change will affect human health and wellbeing through a variety of mechanisms. Climate change can adversely impact on the availability of flesh water supply and the efficiency of local sewerage systems. It is also likely to affect food security. Cereal yields are expected to increase at high and mid latitudes but decrease at lower latitudes. Changes in food production are likely to significantly affect health in Africa. In addition, the distribution and seasonal transmission of several vector-borne infectious diseases (such as malaria and dengue) may be affected by climate change. Altered distribution of some vector species may be among the early signals of climate change. A change in the world climate could increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. The impacts on health of natural disasters are considerable - the number of people killed, injured or made homeless from such causes is increasingly alarming. The vulnerability of people living in risk-prone areas is an important contributor to disaster casualties and damage. An increase in heatwaves (and possibly air pollution) will be a problem in urban areas, where excess mortality and morbidity is currently observed during hot weather episodes. We can assume that climate change will affect the most vulnerable in developing countries. These might be socio-economic deprived populations, people who lack access to a health care system, technology and communication, as well as immuno compromised persons. The health community has, however, difficulties in clearly attributing changes in ranges of diseases or mortality to climatic changes. The main reasons are the gradual process of climate change, the multiple causes of diseases, the many factors that permit human population health to adapt and the lack of retrospective and prospective studies from developing countries. Adaptation is a key response strategy to minimise potential impacts of climate change. A primary objective of adaptation is the reduction, with the least cost, of death, disease, disability and human suffering. The ability to adapt to climate change impacts, and specifically of health, will depend on many factors including existing infrastructure, resources, technology, information and the level of equity in different countries and regions.","Adaptation; Climate change; Health; Impact; Vulnerability","climate change; developing world; disease prevalence; health impact; medical geography",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041926708

We investigated how the diversity of large herbivores changes across gradients of global precipitation and soil fertility. Here we show that more plant-available moisture reduces the nutrient content of plants but increases productivity, whereas more plant-available nutrients increase both of these factors. Because larger herbivore species tolerate lower plant nutrient content but require greater plant abundance, the highest potential herbivore diversity should occur in locations with intermediate moisture and high nutrients. These areas are dry enough to yield high quality plants and support smaller herbivores, but productive enough to support larger herbivores. These predictions fit with observed patterns of body size and diversity for large mammalian herbivores in North America, Africa and Australia, and yield a global map of regions with potentially high herbivore diversity.

Freshwater is vital to human life and societal well-being, and thus its utilization for consumption, irrigation, and transport has long taken precedence over other commodities and services provided by freshwater ecosystems. However, there is growing recognition that functionally intact and biologically complex aquatic ecosystems provide many economically valuable services and long-term benefits to society. The short-term benefits include ecosystem goods and services, such as food supply, flood control, purification of human and industrial wastes, and habitat for plant and animal life - and these are costly, if not impossible, to replace. Long-term benefits include the sustained provision of those goods and services, as well as the adaptive capacity of aquatic ecosystems to respond to future environmental alterations, such as climate change. Thus, maintenance of the processes and properties that support freshwater ecosystem integrity should be included in debates over sustainable water resource allocation. The purpose of this report is to explain how the integrity of freshwater ecosystems depends upon adequate quantity, quality, timing, and temporal variability of water flow. Defining these requirements in a comprehensive but general manner provides a better foundation for their inclusion in current and future debates about allocation of water resources. In this way the needs of freshwater ecosystems can be legitimately recognized and addressed. We also recommend ways in which freshwater ecosystems can be protected, maintained, and restored. Freshwater ecosystem structure and function are tightly linked to the watershed or catchment of which they are a part. Because riverine networks, lakes, wetlands, and their connecting groundwaters, are literally the ""sinks"" into which landscapes drain, they are greatly influenced by terrestrial processes, including many human uses or modifications of land and water. Freshwater ecosystems, whether lakes, wetlands, or rivers, have specific requirements in terms of quantity, quality, and seasonality of their water supplies. Sustainability normally requires these systems to fluctuate within a natural range of variation. Flow regime, sediment and organic matter inputs, thermal and light characteristics, chemical and nutrient characteristics, and biotic assemblages are fundamental defining attributes of freshwater ecosystems. These attributes impart relatively unique characteristics of productivity and biodiversity to each ecosystem. The natural range of variation in each of these attributes is critical to maintaining the integrity and dynamic potential of aquatic ecosystems; therefore, management should allow for dynamic change. Piecemeal approaches cannot solve the problems confronting freshwater ecosystems. Scientific definitions of the requirements to protect and maintain aquatic ecosystems are necessary but insufficient for establishing the appropriate distribution between societal and ecosystem water needs. For scientific knowledge to be implemented science must be connected to a political agenda for sustainable development. We offer these recommendations as a beginning to redress how water is viewed and managed in the United States: (1) Frame national and regional water management policies to explicitly incorporate freshwater ecosystem needs, particularly those related to naturally variable flow regimes and to the linking of water quality with water quantity; (2) Define water resources to include watersheds, so that freshwaters are viewed within a landscape, or systems context; (3) Increase communication and education across disciplines, especially among engineers, hydrologists, economists, and ecologists to facilitate an integrated view of freshwater resources; (4) Increase restoration efforts, using well-grounded ecological principles as guidelines; (5) Maintain and protect the remaining freshwater ecosystems that have high integrity; and (6) Recognize the dependence of human society on naturally functioning ecosystems.","Ecological education; Ecological integrity; Ecosystem protection; Ecosystem services; Freshwater; Freshwater ecosystems; Lakes; Restoration; Rivers; Water management policy; Waterflow: quantity, quality, timing, seasonality; Watersheds; Wetlands","ecosystem approach; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; freshwater ecosystem; water management; water resource; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036825483

Much attention has been given to diversity of species within forests, especially trees that are being harvested. The challenge is to see the forest for the trees: How can the idea of biodiversity at the ecosystem level be translated into practical action for better management of forest ecosystems? The definition of ""ecosystem"" is reasonably well agreed. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) defines the term as ""a dynamic complex of plant, animal and micro-organism communities and their non-living environment interacting as a functional unit"". The living components of an ecosystem interact in very complex food webs (Schoener, 1989). Ecosystem approaches to forest management take into consideration the complexity of these interactions and seek both to maintain the productivity of forest ecosystems and to enhance their capacity to adapt to change. Focusing on the ecosystem level provides a strong basis for solving critical problems in resource management. For example, conserving forest biodiversity at the ecosystem level helps to support services such as maintaining the balance of atmospheric gases, recycling nutrients, regulating climate, maintaining hydrological cycles and creating soil (Daily, 1997). While scientists are still developing their understanding of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, productivity, stability and adaptability of ecosystems, new research indicates that species diversity enhances the productive capacity of many forest ecosystems and their ability to adapt to changing conditions (Johnson et al., 1996). Another important implication of considering forest biodiversity at the ecosystem level is the potential of mismanagement leading to the essentially permanent transformation of a highly productive forest into a much less productive system (such as a grassland). Recent research has indicated that even gradual changes in climate, the flow of nutrients, extraction of natural resources and habitat fragmentation can lead to sudden drastic switches in the character of a forest ecosystem (Scheffer et al., 2001). While many different factors can lead to such shifts, a critical factor is a loss of resilience (the ability to recover from external events) through declining biodiversity at the ecosystem level. In seeking to apply ecosystem approaches to forest biodiversity, especially forests that are being influenced by increasing levels of use by people, it is helpful to focus on some key questions. First, are people part of forest ecosystems? Second, what are the impacts of human harvesting on forest ecosystems? Third, how can forest ecosystems be managed so that they provide both the goods and the services that are required by modern society?

Degrading land uses and management practices disturb the life-supporting biogeochemical cycles within croplands and between croplands and natural ecosystems by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs: CO2, CH4, N2O, CFCs, and tropospheric O3), pollution of water, soil and air, loss of soil organic matter and biodiversity, erosion, salinization and desertification. Sustainability-oriented management practices in croplands include maintenance of soil organic matter by conservation tillage and residue management, windbreaks, selection of crops ecologically adapted to local climate regimes, effecient crop rotation, enhancement of agrobiodiversity (e.g. intercropping and agroforestry), and adoption of proper drainage techniques. Implementation of these preventive and mitigative measures necessitates internalization of ecological principles into agricultural policy and management processes. This study explores the opportunities and limitations of agricultural sustainability in Turkey in a holistic manner. A multiple linear regression (MLR) model was developed to relate CO2 emissions to energy intensity (energy use/gross domestic product), affluence (gross domestic product/population) and population growth. Our MLR model with a high R2 of 97 per cent revealed that stabilization of human population growth, and increasing energy efficiency in economic growth are essential to decreasing GHG emissions and enhancing environmental quality.

The dissertation presents a qualitative analysis of non-sustainable civilisation-nature interaction patterns relevant for global deforestation and forest degradation. Since this problem is closely linked to other core problems of Global Change (GC), e.g. Soil Degradation, World Food security, Climate Change, etc., it is not to be tackled separately. Therefore a novel transdisciplinary approach to analyse non-sustainable civilisation nature interactions in the context of GC is utilised in the investigation. The approach rests on the decomposition of the intricate dynamics of GC into patterns of problematic civilisation nature interactions (""Syndromes"") by an iterative process of observations, data and system theoretical analysis, and GIS based modelling attempts. These Syndromes characterise endangering and risky developments of civilisation nature interaction and represent a baseline for measuring and indicating 'non-sustainability' - in order to have a sustainable development it is necessary to have a far-reaching absence of Syndromes. The patterns are defined as characteristic constellations of interacting socio-economic and physical phenomena (""Symptomes"" of GC), which build complex dynamical systems of civilisation-nature interaction. The cause-effect schemes of Symptomes and their interrelations are constituted as complex phenomena resulting from interactions over the different spheres of the Earth System. The approach is illustrated by a detailed analysis of those civilisation nature interaction patterns relevant for global deforestation. Human activities cause a wide extent of deforestation and threaten the important role of the remaining global forest within the earth system. Global deforestation and forest degradation is made up by a limited number of cause effect patterns observed in different parts of the world. The main syndromes identified causing large scale deforestation are: • The overexploitation of natural ecosystems - the Overexploitation Syndrome. Examples of this pattern are the exploitation of forests for timber or fuelwood and charcoal. • The rural poverty driven overuse of natural resources - the Sahel Syndrome. Examples are the exploitation of forests via slash and burn cultivation by smallholders, particular in tropical developing countries. • Non-sustainable agro-industrial use of soils and bodies of water - the Dust Bowl Syndrome. Examples are the conversion of forest for large cattle farming or cash crop agriculture. Besides these mayor cause-effect schemes of global deforestation, there are several other Syndromes that contribute on a minor scale, e.g. the development and destruction of nature for recreational ends (Mass Tourism Syndrome), the environmental damage of natural landscapes as a result of large-scale projects like dams (Aral Sea Syndrome), the environmental degradation related to mining and extraction of non-renewable resources (Katanga Syndrome) or the environmental degradation through large-scale diffusion of long-lived substances (Smokestack Syndrome) as in the case of acid rain. The geographical analysis of a Syndrome is performed in several steps integrating GIS with concepts of fuzzy logic and qualitative reasoning. In the first step a syndrome specific network of interactions is formulated by analysing case studies, theories and expert assessments. Based on this systemic representation the natural and socio-economic conditions under which the syndrome specific mechanisms can be active are identified. This evaluation is called the disposition of a region towards a specific Syndrome. The resulting indicator can be used as an early warning indicator for the possible germination of a non-sustainable development. Based on the constituting elements of the Syndrome, a complex indicator for the intensity of the active Syndrome is derived in the next step of the analysis. This indicator assesses the critical states in the dynamical evolution of the non-sustainable patterns of civilisation nature interaction. Complete Syndrome analyses are performed for the main Syndromes of deforestation. The resulting spatial distribution of the combined dispositions and intensities of the different Syndromes present a unique global assessment describing the current damage and future regional threats to forests by their underlying global cause-effect patterns of civilisation-nature interaction. Specially the assessment of the threat by coupling of momentarily active and potentially active cause-effect patterns provides a previously not achieved systematic insight into the complex interaction of different patterns of global deforestation and forest degradation.",,"deforestation; forest ecosystem; GIS; human activity; nature-society relations",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035163618

These boundary environments are usually the most diverse elements of aquatic systems. Riparian ecotones moderate the transfer of energy and materials from the land, provide a high load of organic matter including invertebrate food, and moderate competition and predation among animals living in them. Riparian ecotones provide feeding places and shelter for fish, and are particularly important for their reproduction and earliest life-history stages. The complexity and biological importance of riparian ecotones depend on the extent to which the system is self-regulating, which depends in turn on geology, physiography, climate, vegetation, human activity and the age of the system. By changing riparian ecotone character, fish density can be regulated through controlling reproduction and recruitment, and energy flow through the food chain can be controlled for management of water quality.","Feedback mechanisms; Fish; Lakes; Land/water ecotones; Reservoirs; Rivers","aquatic ecosystem; hypothesis testing; ichthyofauna; productivity; recruitment; species diversity",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035174335

Scope for expansion of water supply will, at the same time, be limited because development of irrigation and urban water supplies is becoming increasingly expensive, and often involves high costs in terms of environmental degradation and human resettlement. Without fundamental reform of water management, the rapid growth in urban water demand will require large transfers of water from irrigated agriculture, thereby threatening food security. Hence, water supply and demand should be managed in an integrated fashion, simultaneously considering all uses and sources. This will call for the establishment of community centred food and water security systems and national water trusts. Once such systems and Trusts are established there could be a legally binding Global Water Convention on the model of the Global Convention on Climate and Biodiversity. The details of such a Global Water Conventions can be finalized at one of the future Stockholm Water Symposia.

Development thinking has evolved into a broad pragmatism, realizing that development must move beyond economic growth to encompass important social goals - reduced poverty, improved quality of life, enhanced opportunities for better education and health, and more. Experience has also taught that sustainable progress toward these goals requires integrated implementation and must be firmly anchored in processes that are open, participatory, and inclusive. In the absence of a strong institutional foundation, the outcomes of good policy initiatives tend to dissipate. These lessons and insights are incorporated into the Comprehensive Development Framework, recently initiated by the World Bank to address the challenges of development in a more holistic, integrated way by bringing in aspects such as governance, legal institutions, and financial institutions, which were too often given short shrift earlier. Looking ahead, this report explores the environment in which the major issues of the 21st century - poverty, population growth, food security, water scarcity, climate change, cultural preservation - will be faced. Many powerful forces, both glacial and fast-paced, are reshaping the development landscape. These include innovations in technology, the spread of information and knowledge, the aging of populations, the financial interconnections of the world, and the rising demands for political and human rights. The report focuses in particular on two clusters of change - globalization and localization - because of their immense potential impact. They open up unprecedented opportunities for growth and development, but they also carry with them the threats of economic and political instability that can erode years of hard-earned gains.",,"development strategy; food security; population growth; poverty",Book,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-17544388351

The author reconstructed these whaling activities, examined how the changing climate affected whaling productivity, and considered the consequences of climate and whaling on the species and on the North Atlantic ecosystem. Annual catch records made it possible to calculate the original size of the whale population; its natural migration pattern in the Greenland Sea could be reconstructed using shipping logs and itineraries. Other written sources revealed that besides human hunting activities, climate change played an important role in the elimination of the Greenland right whale from the Arctic marine ecosystem. This elimination made millions of plankton available for other marine mammals, polar cod and plankton-feeding birds.

In South and South-east Asia, 35-79 of the per capita daily calorie intake comes from rice alone. To meet the projected demand, it is estimated that rice production must increase from the current level of about 520 million tones to 880 million dtones by 2025. With the ever-increasing growth rate in population especially in South and South-east Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, continued degradation of resource base and decline in suspport of agricultural research, the task does not seem to be easy. Moreover, the challenge is not only to produce more, but to produce more rice on less land wit less water, less pesticide use and less labour. In addition, rice in some circles, is being condemned as the major culprit for the global warming, climate change, and environmental degradation, although these changes are also a threat to rice production itself. Decline in total factor productivity especially in long and intensive rice-rice and rice-wheat cropping systems, increased use of pesticides and their adverse impact on soil, water, animal and human health, erosion of genetic diversity etc. are cited as examples. It is a fact that in quest of producing more, the high yielding varieties are fast replacing the landraces, the storehouse of valued and rare genes. Similarly, the intensive rice cultivation has led to poor soil-health and water-quality resulting into yield decline even with higher inputs use. Question, therefore, is as how to plan for the increased production of rice on a sustainable basis without having any adverse effects on the environment, in general, and on the resource base in particular. The paper analyses the current scenarios and outlines the strategies for a balance approach to avoid any conflict between food security through increased rice production and sustainability of resource-base and global climate.",,"agricultural production; environmental protection; food security; man-environment relations; resource management; rice; sustainable agriculture",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032407921

With increases in global transport of mercury, it has become important to examine the effects of mercury on components of tropical ecosystems, and to design biomonitoring schemes to assess environmental changes involving mercury. Tropical ecosystems differ from temperate ones in fundamental ways, including increased species diversity, and decreased niche width, spatial heterogeneity, food web lengths and complexity, productivity and soil laterization. Because of these differences, the fate and transport of mercury may differ in temperate and tropical systems, and it is suggested in this paper that bird feathers be used as a biomonitoring tool to assess broad-scale trends in mercury exposure, as well as being indicative of adverse effects on the birds themselves. In many ecosystems, some species of birds occupy top trophic levels. It is apparent that the mercury level in feathers of some tropical birds are as high as those from temperature regions, exceeding levels associated with adverse effects in laboratory studies.","Biomonitoring; Birds; Feathers; Hg","Biomonitoring; Mercury pollution; Air pollution; Ecosystems; Industrial emissions; Mercury (metal); Soil pollution; Water pollution; Environmental impact; biomonitoring; feather; mercury; article; biological monitoring; ecotoxicity; genetic heterogeneity; global climate; human; human cell; mercurialism; species differentiation; Aves",Article,"Final",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031193721

The aim is to minimize agriculture's harmful effects on the environment and to maintain water ad soil resources. Present and future food production depends on suitable land, water, climate, and finances. Unfortunately, the timing is wrong. Population growth is putting pressure on farmers to increase yields. The current conditions are the 11% of the earth's vegetative land surface has diminished productivity due to human activity. There is loss of biodiversity and genetic material. CAttle grazing is inefficient and adds to desertification; animal waste contributes to pollution. Pesticides and fertilizers are the largest US water pollutants. Sustainable agriculture means new tilling methods, reducing pesticide use, and crop rotation. The National Research Council in 1989 reported on alternative agriculture: 1) making the most of natural biological processes; 2) reducing or eliminating pesticides and other chemicals; 3) conserving soil, water, and energy; and 4) matching crops with land to ensure sustainable production levels. Reeducation is needed. Operation SAVE (Sustainable Agriculture that's Voluntary and Economical) produces an annual directory and guide for farmers adopting new methods. Land trusts and conservation easements are being established to preserve farmland. Reclamation of degraded land is being promoted by distribution of tree seedlings to developing countries. Community supported agriculture groups share in the cost of raising crops and receive organic, fresh produce. There are fears about economic feasibility. Conventional farmers argue for pesticide use to increase yields, but a Cornell University study refutes this for organically grown corn. High technology research is not likely to yield a new variety of seed before 2000. Research is needed for poor subsistence farmers. Food distribution is not a problem if everyone is vegetarian. Global warming could also precipitously change climate and affect crops.

These include planning for anticipated effects and developing mitigation options where feasible if climate does change as predicted. For fisheries resources, policy questions address effects on international, national, and regional scales. Climate change variables expected to affect inland and offshore fisheries include temperature rise, changes in the hydrologic cycle, alterations in nutrient fluxes, and reduction and relocation of spawning and nursery habitat. These variables will affect resources at all levels of biological organization, including the genetic, organism, population, and ecosystem levels. In this context, changes in primary productivity, species composition in the food-web, migration, invasions, synchrony in biological cycles, shifts in utilization of niches, and problems of larvae entrainment in estuaries have been identified. Maintaining ecosystem robustness (i.e., high biodiversity) is another component of the problem. Action requires establishing priorities for information needs, determining appropriate temporal and spatial scales at which to model effects, and accounting for interactive changes in physical and biological cycles.
